The yajurvedin-s of all schools use the incantations beginning with agnAviShNU sajoShasa... known as the chamaka-prashna in their vasordhAra. The atharvaveda has an internal reference to what is taken as the vasordhAra:

> vasor yA dhArA madhunA prapInA  
ghR^itena mishrA amR^itasya nAbhayaH |

The atharvan vasordhAra uses a wholly different set of incantations. It begins with brahma jaj~nAnam prathamam...
Then it has the incantation:

> asmin vasu vasavo dhArayantv  
indraH pUShA varuNo mitro agniH |

Here again, the vasavo dhArayantu is taken to signify the vasordhAra. In the middle comes the above incantation vasor yA dhAra...

It also features AV incantation: 

> ud utsaM shatadhAraM sahasradhAram akShitam | 

and related ones. However, the most striking feature of AV vasordhAra is the invocation of 7 goddess in the middle of the rite:  
shrI, lakshmI, dhR^iti, svadhA, svAhA, praj~nA and sarasvatI. 

These are invoked at the top of the tube after the incantion 

> tilavatsA Urjam asmai duhAnA  
> vishvAhA santv anapasphurantIH| ...  
> upAsate pitaraH svadhAbhiH ||

## Goddesses
As some have asked about some of these goddesses a bit of elaboration. 

shrI & lakShmI are homotypes, the old wealth goddess, eventually identified with viShNu-patnI. praj~nA & sarasvatI are similarly homotypes of the old transfunctional goddess in her knowledge aspect. 

svadhA & svAhA are the wives of agni & personification of the ritual call for the gods & ancestors. 

dhR^iti is mentioned in the taittirIya-shruti as the mistress of the R^ita. Oblations to her a key part of the ashvamedha ritual when the horse is turned to come back. Keeping with the old association dhR^iti is called the wife of dharma in the bhArata and mAdrI is mentioned as her incarnation.

It may also be noted that the invocation of 7 goddess parallels the 7 mothers -- the 7 goddesses of the RV & AV and also parallelly in later tradition; e.g. AV-vul incantation:

> ye pR^inanti pra cha yaChanti sarvadA te duhrate dakShiNAM saptamAtaram ||
