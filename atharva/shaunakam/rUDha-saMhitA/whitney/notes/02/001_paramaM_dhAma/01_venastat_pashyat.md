## Translation
1 . Vena (the longing one?) saw that which is highest in secret, where everything becomes of one form; this the spotted one (pṛ́çni) milked [when] born; the heaven-(svàr-)knowing troops (vrá) have shouted at it.

## Notes
A bit of labored obscurity, like the verses that follow; books iv. and v. begin similarly; no attempt will be made here to solve the riddles. The comm. explains at great length (nine 4to pages), but evidently without any traditional or other understanding; he guesses and etymologizes this way and that, giving in part wholly discordant alternative interpretations. In this verse he first takes véna as = Āditya; and then, after a complete exposition on this basis, he says: yadvā: venaḥ parjanyātmā madhyamasthāno devaḥ, and gives another; pṛçni to him is "the common name of sky and sun." The translation given implies emendation in c of jā́yamānās to -nā; but the epithet might belong to vrā́s (so Ludwig and the comm.), or be the second object of aduhat (so Weber). The variants of the parallel versions of other texts make the impression (as often in other cases) of rather aimless stumbling over matters not understood.

VS. (xxxii. 8) and TA. (x. 1. 3) have the first half-verse: VS. reads in a paçyan níhitaṁ gúhā sád, and TA. páçyan víçvā bhúvanāni vidvā́n; both have ékanīḍam at end of b. The pratīka is quoted in ÇÇS. xv. 3. 8, with the addition iti pañca, apparently referring to this hymn. Ppp. has padam for guhā in a, ekanaḍam in b, dhenur for pṛçnis in c (with -nās at the end), and, for d, svarvido 'bhyanuktir virāṭ. The phrase abhy ànūṣata vrā́ḥ occurs also in RV. iv. 1. 16 d; Pischel (Ved. Stud. ii. 121 ⌊and 321⌋) takes vrā́s to mean "women"; the comm. etymologizes it as āvṛtātmānaḥ prajāḥ. ⌊Cf. RV. x. 123. 2.⌋
