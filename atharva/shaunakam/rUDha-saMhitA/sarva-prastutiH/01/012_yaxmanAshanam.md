#### Comment
The translation implies emendation in b to vātābhrajás or -jā́s, as suggested by 3 c; it is proposed by Weber, and adopted by Bloomfield, being a fairly plausible way of getting out of a decided difficulty. Weber renders, however, "with glowing wind-breath"; R., "with scorching wind" (emending to -bhrajjās). The comm. reads vātavrajās (a couple of SPP's mss., which usually follow him, do the same), and explains it as "going swiftly like the wind," or, alternatively, "having a collection of winds." The 'bull' is to him the sun, and he forces this interpretation through the whole hymn. Neither he nor Kāuś. nor the latter's scholia see anywhere any intimation of lightning; yet this is perhaps most plausibly to be suspected in the obscurities of the expression (so R. also). The first words in a are viewed as signifying 'just escaped from its fœtal envelop (in the cloud).' Ppp. is wholly defaced in the second half-verse; in the first it offers no variants, merely combining -jaṣ prath- in a, and reading -bhraja st- in b. Emendation in d to yásyāí' kam would improve both meter and sense. Tredhā́ in d must be read as three syllables (as in RV.) to make the verse a full jagatī. ⌊At OB. vi. 59 b, vā́ta-dhrajās is suggested—by R.?⌋

#### Translation
1. First born of the afterbirth, the ruddy (*usríya*) bull, born of wind  
and cloud (?), goes thundering with rain; may he be merciful to our  
body, going straight on, breaking; he who, one force, hath stridden out  
threefold.

#### Notes
The translation implies emendation in **b** to *vātābhrajás* or *-jā́s*,  
as suggested by 3 **c**; it is proposed by Weber, and adopted by  
Bloomfield, being a fairly plausible way of getting out of a decided  
difficulty. Weber renders, however, "with glowing wind-breath"; R.,  
"with scorching wind" (emending to *-bhrajjās*). The comm. reads  
*vātavrajās* (a couple of SPP's mss., which usually follow him, do the  
same), and explains it as "going swiftly like the wind," or,  
alternatively, "having a collection of winds." The 'bull' is to him the  
sun, and he forces this interpretation through the whole hymn. Neither  
he nor Kāuś. nor the latter's scholia see anywhere any intimation of  
lightning; yet this is perhaps most plausibly to be suspected in the  
obscurities of the expression (so R. also). The first words in **a** are  
viewed as signifying 'just escaped from its fœtal envelop (in the  
cloud).' Ppp. is wholly defaced in the second half-verse; in the first  
it offers no variants, merely combining *-jaṣ prath-* in **a**, and  
reading *-bhraja st-* in **b**. Emendation in **d** to *yásyāí' kam*  
would improve both meter and sense. *Tredhā́* in **d** must be read as  
three syllables (as in RV.) to make the verse a full *jagatī*. ⌊At OB.  
vi. 59 b, *vā́ta-dhrajās* is suggested—by R.?⌋

#### Translation
2. Thee, lurking (*śri*) in each limb with burning (*śocís*), we, paying  
homage, would worship (*vidh*) with oblation; we would worship with  
oblation the hooks, the grapples, \[him\] who, a seizer, hath seized  
this man's joints.

#### Notes
Or *yás*, at beginning of **d**, is abbreviation for 'when he' or 'with  
which he.' ⌊Render, rather, 'hath seized his (accentless) joints.' The  
patient is in plain sight of the exorcist. Emphatic pronoun is therefore  
needless; so *enam* vs. 3.⌋ Some of our mss., by a frequent blunder,  
read in **a** *śiśṛy-*. The prolongation of the final of *asya* in **d**  
is noted by the comment to Prāt. iv. 79. Ppp. has a very different (and  
corrupt) text:...*śiśriyāno yo gṛhīta parasya gṛbhīti: an̄ko tam an̄ko  
haviṣā yajāmi hṛdi śrito manasā yo jajāna.* The definition of this verse  
and the next as *triṣṭubh* seems to have been lost from the Anukr.,  
which reads simply *dvitīyā* before *antyā 'nuṣṭubh.*

#### Translation
3. Release thou him from headache and from cough—whoever hath entered  
each joint of him; the blast (? *śúṣma*) that is cloud-born and that is  
wind-born, let it attach itself to forest-trees (*vánaspáti*) and  
mountains.

#### Notes
Ppp. has *sṛjatām* for *sacatām* in **d**. The comm. takes *kāsás* in  
**a** as nomin., explaining it as *hṛtkaṇṭhamadhyavartī prasiddhaḥ  
śleṣmarogaviśeṣaḥ; vātajā́s* to him is *kāuṣṭhyād vāyor utpannaḥ.* ⌊For  
*śīrṣakti*, see Knauer, *Indogermanische Forschungen, Anzeiger*, vii.  
225; Bloomfield, AJP. xvii. 416; Böhtlingk, *Berichte der sächsischen  
Ges.*, 1897, xlix. 50, who takes it as 'a stiff neck with head awry.'⌋

#### Translation
4. Weal \[be\] to my upper member (*gā́tra*), weal be to my lower, weal  
to my four limbs; weal be to my body.

#### Notes
Ppp. has a quite different text: in **a, b**, *te* both times for *me*,  
and *parāya* for *avarāya;* for **c**, *śaṁ te pṛṣṭibhyo majjabhyaḥ ca;*  
in **d**, *tava* for *mama:* the address to a second person is decidedly  
to be preferred. This is found also in the corresponding verse in VS.  
(xxiii. 44) and TS. (v. 2. 12²), with readings in part agreeing further  
with those of Ppp.: *śáṁ te párebhyo gā́trebhyaḥ śám astv ávarebhyaḥ: śám  
asthábhyo majjábhyaḥ śám v astu tanvāì táva:* but TS. has for **d** *śám
