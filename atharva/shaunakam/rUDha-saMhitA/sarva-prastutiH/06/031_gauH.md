##### Translation
1. Hither hath stridden this spotted steer, hath sat upon his mother in  
the east, and going forward to his father, the heaven (*svàr*).

##### Notes
All the texts agree in this verse, except that TS. has *ásanat* and  
*púnaḥ* in **b**, while Ppp. has *prayat* in **c**. It seems to be a  
description of the rising of a heavenly body,—the comm. and the  
translators say, the sun; but the epithet "spotted," and the number  
thirty in the third verse point rather to the moon. The "mother" is of  
course the earth, upon which it seems to rest a moment.

This spotted Bull hath come and sat before his mother in the east. Advancing to his father Heaven.

##### Translation
2. He moves between the shining spaces, from the breath of this  
outbreathing \[universe\]; the bull (*mahiṣá*) hath looked forth unto  
the heaven (*svàr*).

##### Notes
RV. (with which, through the whole hymn, SV. and VS. entirely agree)  
reads (as does TS.) *apānatī́* (p. *apa॰anatī́*) at end of **b**; in  
**c**, it reads *dívam* for *svàḥ*. TS. inverts the order of **a** and  
**b**, and has the same **c** as our text; on the other hand, MS. has  
our **b**, but *arṇavé* (for *rocanā́*) in **a**, and a wholly peculiar  
**c**: *práti vām sū́ro áhabhiḥ*. Ppp. has (nearly as TS.), for **a, b**,  
*yasya prāṇād apānaty antaś carati rocanaḥ;* and *divam* (with RV.) at  
the end. The sense of the verse is very obscure, made so by the  
unintelligible second pāda; Roth suggests *apānati* ⌊as 3d singular⌋,  
with *rocanā* "stars" as subject: "They die at his breath": but this  
teems with difficulties. ⌊In Geldner's note, *anati* was taken as 3d  
plural.⌋ Our P.M.I.R.T.K., and all SPP's authorities, separate *rocanā́  
asyá* in *saṁhitá* (the *pada*-text reading -*nā́*), and SPP. has  
accordingly, properly enough, adopted it in his text: see the note to  
Prāt. iii. 34. ⌊Ppp. also has *vyākhyan*.⌋

As expiration from his breath his radiance penetrates within. The Bull shines out through all the sky.

##### Translation
3. Thirty domains (*dhā́man*) he rules over; voice, the bird, hath set  
up, to meet the day with the lights of morning.

##### Notes
This translation is one of despair, and of no value, like the others  
that are given of the verse. Taken by itself, the first pāda is well  
enough, and seems most naturally (as noted above) to refer to the thirty  
days of the moon's synodical revolution, or spaces of the sky traversed  
by it in them; to understand it of the thirty divisions of the day  
(*muhūrta*) looks like an anachronism; and thirty gods (Ludwig) is  
wholly senseless. ⌊Roth observes: Ushas, in returning to her point of  
departure, traverses thirty *yojanas* (RV. i. 123. 8): the path of the  
light around the world thus appears to be divided into thirty stages.⌋  
The variety of reading of the texts indicates, as in many other like  
cases, the perplexity of the text-makers. RV. (with SV.VS.) has, for  
**b**, *vā́k pataṁgā́ya dhīyate;* TS. and MS. have. *pataṁgā́ya*, but TS.  
follows it with *śiśriye*, and MS. with   
  
{{smaller block\|*hūyate*. Ppp. reads *-gāya su śriyat*. In **c**, RV.  
(etc.) reads *áha*, particle, for *áhas*, and the comm. does the same;  
TS. gives, for the whole pāda, *práty asya vaha dyúbhiḥ;* while MS.  
substitutes our 2 **c**, in its RV. version, having given its wholly  
independent version of this as 2 **c** (see above); Ppp. has at end  
*divi*. In **a**, MS. reads *triṅśáddhāmā*, as compound; the other texts  
(and three of SPP's authorities) have *triṅśád dhā́ma* (the  
*pada*-reading is *dhā́ma*). Both TS. and MS., it may be added, put vs. 3  
before 2.  
  
With this hymn ends the third *anuvāka*, of 11 hymns and 33 verses; the  
extracted item of Anukr. is simply *tṛtīya* (see end of the next  
*anuvāka*).
