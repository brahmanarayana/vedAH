#### Comment
All the mss.—and SPP., following them—put the avasāna-mark after dhehi, thus falsely dividing the irregular gāyatrī into two pādas ⌊12: 12⌋; hence, of course, they accent ā́tharvaṇa; and most of the pada-mss. (all save our Bp.) read -ṇaḥ (as if the combination -ṇa st- were made by the common and allowable loss of the final ḥ before st: but many of our saṁhitā-mss. also have -ṇaḥ st-; SPP. makes no such report as to his). Both the other texts make the proper division, after ātharvaṇa; and so does Ppp., reading also gāya for the obscure dhehi. Both SV. and AśS. have ā́  ’gād (which is better) for the first gāya; and SV. gives dyúmadgāman for dyumád dhehi. The comm. explains doṣo ⌊i.e. doṣā́ (instr.) u⌋ by rātrāv api, understands bṛhat as the sāman of that name, and supplies dhanam to dyumat in b. In our edition, the accent-mark over the sa of savitāram in c is lost.

##### Translation
1. Sing at evening; sing greatly; put clearly, O son of Atharvan; praise  
god Savitar.

##### Notes
All the mss.—and SPP., following them—put the *avasāna*-mark after  
*dhehi*, thus falsely dividing the irregular *gāyatrī* into two pādas  
⌊12: 12⌋; hence, of course, they accent *ā́tharvaṇa;* and most of the  
*pada*-mss. (all save our Bp.) read *-ṇaḥ* (as if the combination *-ṇa  
st-* were made by the common and allowable loss of the final *ḥ* before  
*st*: but many of our *saṁhitā*-mss. also have *-ṇaḥ st-*; SPP. makes no  
such report as to his). Both the other texts make the proper division,  
after *ātharvaṇa;* and so does Ppp., reading also *gāya* for the obscure  
*dhehi*. Both SV. and AśS. have *ā́ ’gād* (which is better) for the first  
*gāya;* and SV. gives *dyúmadgāman* for *dyumád dhehi*. The comm.  
explains *doṣo* ⌊i.e. *doṣā́* (instr.) *u*⌋ by *rātrāv api*, understands  
*bṛhat* as the *sāman* of that name, and supplies *dhanam* to *dyumat*  
in **b**. In our edition, the accent-mark over the *sa* of *savitāram*  
in **c** is lost.

##### Translation
2. Praise thou him who is within the river, son of truth (*satyá*),  
\[him\] the young, of unhateful speech, very propitious.

##### Notes
Again all the mss. spoil the structure of the verse by putting the  
division-mark after *sūnúḥ*. In both verses, SPP's text follows the  
mss., while ours emends in accordance with the true sense—which is now  
further supported by the other text, and by Ppp. An easier reading is  
offered by AśS., namely *tam u ṣṭuhy antaḥsindhuṁ sūnuṁ satyasya  
yuvānam: adro-*. Indra is called "son of truth" in RV. viii. 58 (69). 4;  
the descriptions of the verse suit Savitar ill. The comm. understands  
'the river (*sindhu*)' as "the ocean (*samudra*), in the midst of which  
the sun is seen rising," and foolishly gives as alternative sense of  
*yuvan* "repeller (*yu*) of darkness." The Anukr. apparently scans 11: 6  
+ 8 = 25.

Yea, praise him whose home is in the river, Son of Truth, the youthful, gracious friend whose word is guileless.

##### Translation
3. May he, indeed, god Savitar, impel (*sū*) for us many amrtas, both  
the good praises, unto welfare.

##### Notes
The division of the mss. is this time that also of our text; but the  
meter is pretty hopeless (*bhū́ri amṛ́tā* would rectify **b**), and **c**  
apparently corrupt. Ppp. has, for **b**, *sāviṣad vasupatir vasūni*  
(making **a, b** nearly equal RV. vii. 45. 3 **a, b**), and AśS. the  
same with omission of *vasūni*. In **c**, Ppp. ends with *sugātum*  
(perhaps 'to sing well both good praises'); AśS. reads *ubhe sukṣitī  
sudhātuḥ*. The Pet. Lex. ⌊vii. 1045⌋ suggests, for **c**, *ubhe srutī su  
gātave:* cf. RV. ix. 78. 2; the varieties of reading show that the pāda  
was virtually unintelligible to the text-makers. The comm. takes  
*suṣṭutī* first as the *bṛhat* and *rathantara sāmans*, and then,  
alternatively, as the *stuta* and *śastra*. Of course, if the verse is  
to be taken (as seems necessary) as a spoiled *gāyatrī*, we ought to  
read *sā́viṣat*, with accent. The Anukr. seems to scan 11 + 6: 9 = 26.  
⌊See p. lxix, note 2.⌋

Savitar our God shall send us many everlasting treasures, that both paths may well be travelled.
