#### Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xix., in the verse-order 1, 3, 2. The hymn is reckoned by Kāuś. (9. 2) to the bṛhachānti gaṇa; it is used (25. 20) in healing rites against various diseases, and (25. 21) especially against disorders arising from soma drinking; and (41. 14), with hymn 19 and others, in a ceremony for good fortune; it is further (note to 7. 14) one of the apāṁ sūktāni. Vāit. (30. 7) has it in the sāutrāmaṇī ceremony with the preparation of surā for one disordered by soma. ⌊Keśava (to 61. 5) counts this hymn (not 57) to a pavitra gaṇa.⌋


#### Translations
Translated: Griffith, i. 273.

#### Translation
1. Purified with Vāyu's purifier, Soma \[hath\] run over opposite  
(*pratyán̄*), Indra's suitable companion.

#### Notes
The translation implies, at the end of **b**, *áti drutás* (or  
*atidrutas*, as the comm. appears to read), which SPP. has rightly in  
his text. In most mss. *dru* and *hru* are hardly distinguishable (and  
not easily distinguishable from *du* and *hu*), and *hru* was  
unfortunately adopted in our text, because the first mss. consulted  
favored that reading. Ppp. has instead *adhiśrutaḥ*. The verse is found  
twice\* in VS. (x. 31 **d**; xix. 3 **a**), twice in TB. (ii. 6. 1²⁻³;  
two immediately successive versions), and thrice in MS. (ii. 3. 8; and  
iii. 11. 7 two immediately successive versions), and, what is unusual,  
with differences of reading in the different versions. VS. differs from  
our text ⌊see note\*⌋ in **b**, having in x. *átisrutas*, and in xix.  
*átidrutas*. TB. has both times *vāyús* at the beginning, but in **b**  
the first time prank and the second *prā́n̄k*, both times *átidrutas*. MS.  
has in ii. *vā́yos* (doubtless a misprint for *vāyós*) and *átisrutas;*  
in iii., the first time *vāyús*, *prā́k*, and *átidrutas*, the second  
time *vāyós*, *pratyák*, and *átisrutas*. The Atharvan reading,  
according to the Prāt, phonetic rule ii. 9, ought to be *pratyán̄k*  
before a following *s*; but (as explained in the note to that rule) the  
mss. read simple *n̄*, and both printed texts adopt it. ⌊Cf. Weber,  
*Rājasūya*, p. 101, n. 7.⌋ \*⌊Should be "thrice": W. overlooked that at  
xix. 3 also there are two immediately successive versions, the first  
with *pratyán̄k...átidrutaḥ*, the second with *prā́n̄k...átidrutaḥ*.  
Moreover, VS. has in x. (like TB.) *vāyúḥ*.⌋

#### Translation
2. Let the mother waters further (*sūd*) us; let the ghee-purifying ones  
purify us with ghee; since the heavenly ones carry forth all evil  
(*riprá*), forth from them, indeed, I come clean, purified.

#### Notes
The verse is found also as RV. x. 17. 10, with the single variant  
*śundhayantu* at end of **a**; the comm. gives to *sūd-* the same  
meaning (*kṣālayantu pāparahitān śuddhān kurvantu*). VS. (iv. 2) also  
has it, precisely in the RV. version; and MS. (i. 2. 1), with *mā* for  
*asmā́n* and *nas* in **a** and **b**, and with *-váhantu* in **c**. Ppp.  
has *-vahantu* likewise, and at the end it reads *pūtay emi*, which,  
curiously enough, Schröder notes as read by two of his mss. and by the  
Kapiṣṭhala text. Ppp. has further the phonetic ⌊? graphic⌋ variant  
*ghṛtapuvas* in **b**.

#### Translation
3. Whatever, O Varuṇa, that is hateful to the people of the gods human  
beings practise here, if without intention we have obstructed thine  
ordinances (*dhármān*), do not, O god, harm us for that sin.

#### Notes
The verse is RV. vii. 89. 5, which, however, reads at end of **b**  
*cárāmasi*, and at beginning of **c** *ácittī yát táva* etc. TS. (iii.  
4. 11⁶) and MS. (iv. 12. 6) agree precisely with RV.  
  
The fifth *anuvāka*, 10 hymns with 30 verses, ends here; the Anukr.  
quotation, *pan̄cama*, has to be combined with that to the next  
*anuvāka*.  
  
Here ends also the thirteenth *prapāṭhaka*.
