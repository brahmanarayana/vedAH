#### Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xvi. The hymn ⌊not 1 cd, 2 cd⌋ occurs in TB. (iii. 7. 98-9), and parts of it elsewhere, see under the verses. ⌊For 1 and 3, see also v. Schroeder, Tübinger Kaṭha-hss., p. 70 and 61.⌋ Hymns 117-119 are used in Kāuś. (133. 1) in the rite in expiation of the portent of the burning of one's house; and Keś. (to Kāuś. 46. 36) quotes them as accompanying the satisfaction of a debt after the death of a creditor, by payment to his son or otherwise; the comm. gives (as part of the Kāuś. text) the pratīka of 117. ⌊For the whole anuvāka, see under h. 114.⌋ In Vāit. (24. 15), in the agniṣṭoma, h. 117 goes with the burning of the vedi.


#### Translations
Translated: Ludwig, p. 444; Griffith, i. 309.

##### Translation
1. What I eat (?) that is borrowed, that is not given back; with what  
tribute of Yama I go about—now, O Agni, I become guiltless (*anṛṇá*) as  
to that; thou knowest how to unfasten all fetters.

##### Notes
The translation implies emendation of *ásmi* to *ádmi* in **a**; this is  
suggested by *jaghasa* in vs. 2, and is adopted by Ludwig also; but  
possibly *apratīttam asmi* might be borne as a sort of careless vulgar  
expression for "I am guilty of non-payment." More or less of the verse  
is found in several other texts, with considerable variations of  
reading: thus TS. (iii. 3. 8¹⁻²), TA. (ii. 3. 1⁸), and MS. (iv. 14. 17)  
have pādas **a, b, c** (as **a, b, d** in TS.); in **a**, all with *yát  
kúsīdam* for *apamítyam* and without *asmi*, and TA.MS. with  
*ápratītam*, and TS. ending with *máyi* (for *yát*), and TA.MS. with  
*máye ’há;* in **b**, all put *yéna* before *yamásya*, and TA.MS. have  
*nidhínā* for *balínā*, while MS. ends with *cárāvas;* in **c** (**d**  
in TS.), all read *etát* for *idám*, and MS. accents *ánṛṇas* (**c** in  
TS. is *ihāt ’vá sán nirávadaye tát:* cf. our 2 **a**); **d** in TA. is  
*jī́vann evá práti tát te dadhāmi*, with which MS. nearly agrees, but is  
corrupt at the end: *j.e.p. hastā́nṛṇāni*. TB. (iii. 7. 9⁸) corresponds  
only in the first half-verse (with it precisely agrees ĀpśS. in xiii.  
22, 5): thus, *yā́ny apāmítyāny ápratīttāny ásmi yamásya balínā cárāmi;*  
its other half-verse corresponds with our 2 **a, b**. MB. (ii. 3. 20)  
has *yat kusīdam apradattam maye ’ha yena yamasya nidhinā carāṇi: idaṁ  
tad agne anṛṇo bhavāmi jīvann eva pratidatte dadāni*. ⌊This suggests  
*bhavāni* as an improvement in our **c**.⌋ Finally GB. (ii. 4. 8) quotes  
the *pratīka* in this form: *yat kusīdam apamityam apratītam*. Ppp.  
reads for **a, b** *apamṛtyum apratītaṁ yad asininnasyena*, etc., and,  
for **d**, *jīvanna ena prati dadāmi sarvam* (nearly as TA. **d**,  
above). The comm. takes *balinā* as = *balavatā*.

That which I eat, a debt which still is owing, the tribute due to Yama, which supports me, Thereby may I be free from debt, O Agni. Thou knowest how to rend all bonds asunder.

##### Translation
2. Being just here we give it back; living, we pay it in (*ni-hṛ*) for  
the living; what grain I have devoured having borrowed \[it\], now, O  
Agni, I become guiltless as to that.

##### Notes
With the first half-verse nearly agrees TB. (as above; also ĀpśS., as  
above), which reads, however, *tád yātayāmas* for *dadma enat*. The  
comm. has *dadhmas* for *dadmas* in **a**; he explains *ni harāmas* by  
*nitarāṁ niyamena vā ’pākurmaḥ*. Ppp. has *etat* at end of **a**; in  
**c**, *apamṛtyu* again, also (**c, d**) *jaghāsā agnir mā tasmād anṛṇaṁ  
kṛṇotu*. *Apamítyam* in this verse also would be a more manageable form,  
as meaning 'what is to be measured (or exchanged) off,' i.e. in  
repayment. *Jaghā́sa* in our text is a misprint for *-ghás-*.
</details>
<details><summary>Griffith</summary>

Still dwelling here we give again this present; we send it forth, the living from the living. Throwing away the grain whence I have eaten, thereby shall I be free from debt, O Agni.

##### Translation
3. Guiltless in this \[world\], guiltless in the higher, guiltless in  
the third world may we be; the worlds traversed by the gods and  
traversed by the Fathers—all the roads may we abide in guiltless.

##### Notes
The verse is found in TB. (iii. 7. 9⁸⁻⁹), TA. (ii. 15⁴), and ĀpśS.  
(xiii. 22. 5), with *-miṅs tṛ-* at junction of **a** and **b** (except  
in TB. as printed), with *utá* inserted before *pitṛyā́ṇās* and *ca  
lokā́s* omitted after it (thus rectifying the meter, of which the Anukr.  
ignores the irregularity), and with *kṣīyema* (bad) at the end. *Anṛṇá*  
means also 'free from debt or obligation'; there is no English word  
which (like German *schuldlos*) covers its whole sense. The comm. points  
out that it has here both a sacred and a profane meaning, applying to  
what one owes to his fellow-men, and what duties to the gods. Ppp.  
combines *anṛṇā ’smin* in **a**, and has the readings of TB. etc. in  
**c**, and *adīma* for *ā kṣiyema* at the end.
</details>
<details><summary>Griffith</summary>

May we be free in this world and that yonder, in the third world may we be unindebted. May we, debt-free, abide in all the pathways, in all the worlds which Gods and Fathers visit.
