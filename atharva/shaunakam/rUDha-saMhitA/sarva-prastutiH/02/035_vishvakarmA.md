##### Comment
Found (except vs. 5, and in the verse-order 2, 3, 1, 4) in Pāipp. i. The same four verses are found in TS. (iii. 2. 81-3: in the order 2, 4, 3, 1), and the first three in MS. (ii. 3. 8; in the order 1, 3, 2). The hymn is used by Kāuś. (38. 22) in a rite intended, according to the comm., to prevent faults of vision (dṛṣṭidoṣanivāraṇāya; Keśava says "to prevent rain," vṛṣṭinivāraṇāya; perhaps his text is corrupt), accompanying the eating of something in an assembly. Its employment (59. 21) with the hymn next preceding was noticed under the latter. The comm. (differing in his reading and division of the rules from the edited text of Kāuś.) declares it to be used in all the sava sacrifices, to accompany the purastād homas (59. 23-4: uttareṇa savapurastāddhomān); and vs. 5 is used (3. 16) with a purastād homa in the parvan sacrifices. In Vāit. the hymn appears (9. 7) in the cāturmāsya sacrifice, with two oblations to Mahendra and Viśvakarman respectively; and again (29. 22) in the agnicayana. In all these applications there is nothing that suits the real character of the hymn.

##### Translation
1. They who, partaking \[of soma\] (*bhakṣ*), did not prosper (*ṛdh*) in  
good things, whom the fires of the sacrificial hearth were distressed  
about (*anu-tapya-*)—what was the expiation (*avayá*) of their  
ill-sacrifice, may Viśvakarman ('the all-worker') make that for us a  
good sacrifice.

##### Notes
The translation implies emendation of *dúriṣṭis* in **c** to *-ṭes*, and  
of *tā́n* in **d** to *tā́m;* *tā́m* is read by the comm., as well as by  
TS. and MS., and SPP. even admits it into his text, though nearly all  
his mss., as well as ours, read *tā́n*. Our P. and M. read *āvṛdhús* at  
end of **a**; TS. has *ānṛhús*, MS. *ānaśús.* TS. elides the *a* of  
*anu* in **b**; it begins **c** with *iyám* for *yā́*, and ends it with  
*dúriṣṭyāi*, thus supporting our emendation. Both TS. and MS. give  
*kṛṇotu* in **d**, and MS. puts it after *viśvákarmā.* The *pada-*mss.  
read in **c** *ava॰yā́*, but SPP. alters his *pada*-text to *ava-yā́ḥ*, on  
the authority of the comm.; it is a matter of indifference, as the  
concluding element, in spite of the native grammarians, is doubtless the  
root *yā.* Ppp. gives *duriṣṭā sviṣṭam* in **c, d**. The various  
readings, here and in the following verses, are in good part of the kind  
which show that the text-makers were fumbling over matter which they did  
not understand. The comm. is no better off. Here, in **a**, he is  
uncertain whether to take *ná* as 'as if' or 'not,' and to make *vásūni*  
object of *bhakṣáyantas* or of *ānṛdhús* (= *vardhitavantas*, which is  
not bad). ⌊The fires, pāda **b**, are personified in like fashion at  
AGS. iv. 1. 2, 3.⌋ The verse (12 + 12: 9 + 11 = 44) is much more  
irregular than the definition of the Anukr. admits.

We who enjoying it have grown no richer, for whom the sacred altar-fires have sorrowed, We who compounded with deficient worship,--may Visvakarman make our service prosper.

##### Translation
2. The seers declare the master (*-páti*) of the sacrifice by reason of  
sin disportioned, distressed about \[his\] offspring. What honeyed drops  
he offended in (? *apa-rādh*), with them let Viśvakarman unite  
(*sam-sṛj*) us.

##### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
MS. has in **a** the equivalent *yájamānam;* its **b** reads *vihā́ya  
prajā́m anutápyamānāḥ;* while TS. has *prajā́*(*ḥ*) *nírbhaktā*(*ḥ*)  
*anutapyámānāḥ*, and Ppp. *nirbhāgatā bhāgād anutapyamānā.* TS. and MS.  
make the lost drops only two: *madhavyāù stokāú...tā́bhyām*, with *tāú*  
instead of *yā́n*, and hence *rarādha*. The translation implies  
correction to *madhavy-*, as read by both the parallel texts and the  
comm.; SPP's text agrees with ours in reading the *mathavy-* of all the  
mss. (except three of SPP's, which follow the comm.). All the  
*saṁhitā*-mss. make the absurd combination *naṣ ṭébhiḥ* in **d**,  
seeming to have in mind the participle *naṣṭá;* SPP. retains *naṣṭébhis*  
in his text, while ours emends to *nas tébhis*, as given in the comment  
to Prāt. ii. 31. Ppp. has our second half-verse as its 3 **c, d**; it  
reads *madhavyāṅ stokān upa yā rarādha saṁ mā tarāis sṛjad viśvakarmā.*  
The comm. takes *anu* and *tapy-* in **b** as two independent words; he  
explains *apa rarādha* in **c** by *antaritān kṛtavān*, which is  
doubtless its virtual meaning. ⌊W's prior draft reads: "what honeyed  
drops he failed of"—that is, 'missed.'⌋
</details>
<details><summary>Griffith</summary>

Rishis have called the sacrifice's patron amerced through sin, sorrowing for his offspring. Those drops of meath whereof the missed enjoyment,--may Visvakarman with those drops unite us.

##### Translation
3. Thinking the soma-drinkers to be unworthy of gifts (? *adānyá*),  
\[though\] knowing of the sacrifice, \[he is\] not wise (*dhī́ra*) in the  
conjuncture (*samayá*); in that this man is bound having committed a  
sin, do thou, O Viśvakarman, release him for his well-being.

##### Notes
The offense here had in view is far from clear. Instead of *adānyá*  
(which occurs only here), TS. has the apparently unintelligent  
*ananyā́n;* MS. reads *ayajñiyā́ṅ yajñíyān mány-* 'thinking the unfit for  
offering to be fit for offering' (or vice versa); both have in **b**  
*prāṇásya* for *yajñásya*, and *samaré* for *-yé*. Ppp. gives the second  
half-verse as 2 **c, d**, and ends it with *pra mumugdhy enaṁ*. TS. MS.  
have no *yát* at beginning of **c**; TS. gives *énaś cakṛvā́n máhi*, and  
MS. *éno mahác cakṛvā́n b-*, and TS. *eṣām* for *eṣá*. The comm. explains  
*adānyān* as *ajñatvāropeṇa dānānarhān*, takes *na* in **b** as particle  
of comparison, and makes *samaya* equal *saṁgrāma:* "as if one by  
confidence in the strength of his own arm should think the opposing  
soldiers despicable"! The verse (11 + 11: 10 + 12 = 44) has marked  
irregularities which the Anukr. ignores.

Regarding niggard churls as Soma-drinkers, skilful in sacrifice, weak at the meeting, Whatever sin the captive hath committed, do thou for weal release him, Visvakarman!

##### Translation
4. Terrible \[are\] the seers; homage be to them! what sight \[is\]  
theirs, and the actuality (*satyá*) of their mind. For Brihaspati, O  
bull (*mahiṣá*), \[be\] bright (*dyumánt*) homage; O Viśvakarman, homage  
to thee! protect thou us.

##### Notes
The translation follows our text, though this is plainly corrupted. TS.  
makes **b** less unintelligible by reading *cákṣuṣas* for *cákṣur yát*,  
and *saṁdhāú* for *satyám;* Ppp. has in the half-verse only minor  
variants: *bhīma* for *ghorās*, *‘stu* for *astu*, *saṁdṛk* for  
*satyam.* In **c**, TS. has *mahí ṣát* for the senseless *mahiṣa*, and  
the comm. presents the same; Ppp. reads *bṛhaspate mahiṣāya dive: namo  
viśv-*. TS. gives for **d** *námo viśákarmaṇe sá u pātv asmā́n*. In **d**  
all the *pada*-mss. have the strange blunder *pāhi*, for *pāhí* as  
required by the sense and by the *saṁhitā*-text.; and SPP. adopts the  
blunder, thus giving a *pada*-reading that is inconvertible into his own  
*saṁhitā.* The comm. takes *ṛṣayas* in **a** as "the breaths, sight  
etc.," and *satyam* in **b** as *yathārthadarśi;* and he founds on this  
interpretation the use in Kāuś. 38. 22, "against faults of vision."

Awful are Rishis: unto them be homage, and to their eye and truthfulness of spirit! Loud homage to Brihaspati, O mighty! Homage to thee, O Visvakarman! Guard us.

##### Translation
5. The sacrifice's eye, commencement, and face: with voice, hearing,  
mind I make oblation. To this sacrifice, extended by Viśvakarman, let  
the gods come, well-willing.

##### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The verse is found in no other text, and is perhaps not a proper part of  
the hymn; it is repeated below as xix. 58. 5. A few of the  
*saṁhitā*-mss. (including our O.) ignore the *ā́* at beginning of **d**.  
The comm. is not certain whether the three nominatives in **a**  
designate Agni or sacrificial butter; but he has no scruple about making  
them objects to *juhomi.*
</details>
<details><summary>Griffith</summary>

The eye of sacrifice, source, and beginning--with voice, ear, spirit unto him I offer. To this our sacrifice wrought by Visvakarman may the Gods come gracious and kindly-hearted.
