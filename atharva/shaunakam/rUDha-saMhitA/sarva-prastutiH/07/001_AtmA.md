#### Translation
1. They either who by meditation led the beginning (*ágra*) of speech,  
or who by mind spoke righteous things (*ṛtá*)—they, increasing with the  
third incantation (*bráhman*), perceived (*man*) with the fourth the  
name of the milch cow.

#### Notes
The book, like some of those preceding, begins with mystic, obscure, and  
un-Atharvanic material. The comm. has no idea what it means, and sets  
forth his ignorance at immense length, giving about five quarto pages of  
exposition to this first hymn, with wholly discordant alternative  
explanations. The verse occurs also in śśS. (xv. 3. 7), with  
*saṁvidānās* for *vāvṛdhānās* in **c**, and *manvata* in **d**. For  
*’vadann* in **b** Ppp. has *vadeyann*, and *turyeṇa* at beginning of  
**d**. For pāda **a** cf. RV. x. 71. 1; for **d**, RV. iv. 1. 16 and v.  
40. 6. The commentary to Prāt. i. 74 quotes *dhītī́* as an *ī*-form with  
non-*pragṛhya* final, because not locative; and the *pada*-text does not  
treat it as *pragṛhya*.

They who by thought have guided all that Speech hath best, or they who with their heart have uttered words of truth, Made stronger by the strength which the third prayer bestows, have by the fourth prayer learned the nature of the Cow.

#### Translation
2. He, \[as a\] son, knows his father, he his mother; he is (*bhuvat*) a  
son (*sūnú*), he is one of generous returns (? *púnarmagha*); he  
enveloped the sky, the atmosphere, he the heaven (*svàr*); he became  
this all; he came to be here (*ā-bhū*).

#### Notes
This verse is found also in TS. (ii. 2. 12¹) and TB. (iii. 5. 7²), with  
difference of reading only in the second half, where they have *āúrṇod  
antárikṣaṁ sá súvaḥ sá víśvā bhúvo abh-*. Ppp. so far agrees with them  
as to have, for **d**, *viśvām bhuvo ‘bhavat svābhuvat*. The comm., in  
**b**, takes *punarmaghas* first as two separate words (*magha* =  
*dhana*) and then as a compound, "with wealth repeatedly increased in  
spite of giving of much wealth to his praisers." The comment to TS. says  
*punaḥ-punar yajamānāya dātavyaṁ dhanaṁ yasya*. The verse lacks two  
syllables of being a full *jagatī*.
