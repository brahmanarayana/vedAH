#### Comment
Wanting in Pāipp., but perhaps by reason of the lacuna noted under the preceding verse. Employed by Kāuś. (79. 7) in the same ceremony as the preceding hymn, with the direction ity abhichādayati, which may well enough mean, as plainly required by the sense of the verse, 'she envelops him,' but is explained by the schol. as 'one envelops the two spouses.'

##### Translation
1. I bridle (*abhi-dhā*) thee with my Manu-born garment, that thou  
mayest be wholly mine, mayest not make mention of other women.

##### Notes
The comm. explains *manu-* alternatively by *mantreṇa*, and takes  
*kīrtayās* as = *uccares;* and he supplies *nāmadheyam* as the latter's  
direct object, governing *anyāsām*. "Manu-born" is a strange epithet for  
a garment; perhaps the woman's embrace is intended, or her hair—if this  
be not too poetic. The second half-verse is nearly identical with 38. 4  
**c, d**.
