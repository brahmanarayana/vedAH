##### Comment
Of this hymn only vs. 4 is found in Pāipp. (in xx.). The comm. finds it used in Nakṣ. K. 17, 19, in a mahāśānti ceremony called āgneyī, on occasion of danger from fire, with the insertion of a golden earring; further, in Pariś. 11. 1, in a tulāpuruṣa ceremony.


##### Translations
Translated: Grill, 49, 192; Griffith, ii. 283; Bloomfield, 63, 668.

##### Translation
1. The gold that, born out of the fire, immortal, maintains itself over  
mortals—whoso knows it, he verily merits (*arh*) it; one that dies of  
old age becomes he who wears (*bhṛ*) it.

##### Notes
SPP. accents at the end *bibhárti*, with the great majority of the mss.  
(the same also in 2 **d**); our preference for *bíbharti* was because  
only this accent is found elsewhere in AV. Most of the mss. accent  
*énad* in **c**. The masculine *enam* in **c** is surprising, as no hint  
of anything masculine is met with elsewhere in the hymn; the comm.  
explains it as *anvādiṣṭaṁ hiraṇyarūpam padārtham*. In a corresponding  
verse (6) found in a *khila* of the RV. (to x. 128) is read instead  
*enad* (one ms. *vedam*), which is more likely to be the true text. The  
same has in **b** *jajñe* for *dadhre*. The Anukr. takes no notice of  
the redundant syllable in **c**.

Gold that was born from Fire is immortal hath been deposited with mortal creatures. He who knows this deserves to own this jewel, and in extreme old age dies he who wears it.

##### Translation
2. The gold, of beauteous color by the sun, that men (*mánu*) of old  
with their progeny sought—that, shining (*candrá*), shall unite thee  
with splendor; of long life becomes he who wears it.

##### Notes
Very nearly all the mss. read *iṣiré* at end of **b**; but both  
editions, and the comm., give *īṣiré*. The majority of mss. also accent  
*pūrvé*. SPP. reads at end of **c** *sṛjati*, with all the authorities  
(save his P., which has *sṛjāti*)\*; both sense and meter so plainly  
call for *sṛjāti* that we adopted it as an emendation in our text; the  
comm. reads *sṛjatu*. As to *bibharti* at the end, see note to vs. i.  
\*⌊W's P.M. have *sṛjasvā ”yu-*.⌋

<details><summary>Griffith</summary>

The men of ancient time with children round them longed for this Gold, bright with the Sun's own colour, This shall endow thee, as it shines, with splendour, and long shall be the life of him who wears it.

##### Translation
3. For life-time thee, for splendor thee, and for force and for  
strength—that with brilliancy of gold thou mayest shine out among the  
people.

##### Notes
The comm. reads in **c** *hiraṇyaṁ tej-*. The comm. supplies in **a, b**  
*saṁ sṛjatu* to each noun, as if they were in the instrumental case,  
which is plainly wrong. Probably the 'thee' of the first line is  
different from the 'thou' of the second, being addressed to the article  
of gold itself.  
  
⌊The comm. (as noted) and the text of the comm. have *hiraṇyaṁ tejasā;*  
but all the other authorities are agreed as to the accentuation  
*hiraṇyatéjasā;* which, however, is inherently improbable (*Gram.* §1267  
b), if, with the *pada*-text, we take the combination as one compound  
word. Both mss. and comm. and accent all point the other way, and we  
have doubtless to assume as *pada*-reading *hiraṇya: téjasā*, as two  
words, of which the first is vocative; and, but for our blundering  
*pada-kāra*, this is just what our *saṁhitā*-reading would naturally be  
taken to mean. The comm. understands 'thee' as referring to the man who  
wears the gold amulet; but the whole verse gains in concinnity, if we  
refer 'thee' (with W.) to the amulet itself, and supply with the first  
half the verb *badhnāmi* (as at i. 35. 1 **c**; iv. 10. 7 **c**; xix.  
46. 1 **c, d**), and take the second half also as addressed to the  
amulet.⌋

Long life and splendour let it bring energy and strength to thee. That thou mayst shine among the folk with all the brightness of the Gold.

##### Translation
4. What king Varuṇa knows, \[what\] divine Bṛihaspati knows, what Indra  
the Vṛitra-slayer knows,—may that be for thee life-giving, may that be  
for thee splendor-giving.

##### Notes
Next after the verse already quoted (under vs. 1) from the RV. *khila*,  
occurs another corresponding to this, but having for **b** *yad u devī  
sarasvatī*, and for **d** *tan me varcasa āyuṣe*, and lacking a fifth  
pāda. Ppp. has in **b** *yad u divo bṛh-*, puts *yad* before *indras* in  
**c**, and has for **d**, and for end of the verse, *tac cittaṁ cittam  
arhaṇam*.  
  
⌊Here ends the third *anuvāka*, with 6 hymns and 65 verses.⌋

<details><summary>Griffith</summary>

What Varuna the King knows well, and what the God Brihaspati, And Indra, Slayer of the Foe, may that bestow long life on thee, may that increase thy splendid strength.
