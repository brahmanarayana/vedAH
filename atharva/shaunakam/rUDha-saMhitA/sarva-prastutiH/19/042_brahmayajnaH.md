##### Comment
Only fragments of this hymn are found in Pāipp.; ⌊Roth's Collation says that the hymn probably stood somewhere near the beginning⌋. No viniyoga is given.

##### Translation
1. The *bráhman* is invoker (*hótṛ*) the *bráhman* is the sacrifice; by  
the *bráhman* the sacrificial posts are set up; the officiating priest  
(*adhvaryú*) is born from the *bráhman;* within the *bráhman* is put the  
oblation.

##### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
In **a** all the authorities ⌊and so SPP.⌋ read *yajñā́s*, which might  
better have been left unchanged. In **b** the authorities have mostly  
*sváravāmitā́* (also *svàravāmitā́*, and *sár-* or *sàravāmitā́*),  
*pada*-text *svàḥ: avāmitā́;* the comm., *svaragāmitā*, for which he  
gives a labored and worthless explanation; *sváravo mitā́ḥ* was our  
emendation, which is made certain by its occurrence in TB. ii. 4. 7¹⁰  
(in a verse otherwise corresponding with our vs. 2); and even SPP.  
follows it. In **d** the comm. has *brahmaṇi*, which suits better with  
*antar;* but the same sense is perhaps possible with *-ṇas*,\* which is  
the universal reading. Then the mss. give *antárhite* (p. *antáḥ॰hite*);  
our edition emends to *antár hitám;* SPP. agrees so far as to give  
*antárhitam;* the comm. has either the one or the other (the absence of  
accent makes it impossible to say which); if *bráhmaṇas* is not altered  
to *-ṇi, antárhitam* is as good as necessary; otherwise, each is about  
equally acceptable. \*⌊W. seems to have in mind such a construction as  
*tád antár asya sárvasya*, at Īśā Upanishad, vs. 5. If so, I do not see  
why he says that, if we read *bráhmaṇas*, we must also read  
*antárhitam*.⌋

Brahma is Hotar, sacrifice: with Brahma are the stakes set up. From Brahma was the Adhvaryu born, from Brahma hidden offering.

##### Translation
2. The *bráhman* is the sacrificial spoons filled with ghee; by the  
*bráhman* is the sacrificial hearth set up (*ud-dhā*) and the *bráhman*  
is the essence (*tattvá*) of the sacrifice—the priests that are  
oblation-makers: ⌊to the slaughtered \[victim\] hail!⌋

##### Notes
To the verse corresponds one in TB. ii. 4. 7¹⁰, which, however, has for  
**b** our 1 **b** (as noted above), and in **c** *yajñásya tántavaḥ*,  
and lacks the addition after **d**. In our text is left in **a**  
inadvertently *srucás*, which most of the mss. give; SPP. has the  
correct *srúcas* (so TB.). In **b**, our *pada*-mss. have *út॰hitā*, ⌊a  
word-division⌋ which is contrary to Prāt. iv. 63 and to the usage of the  
AV. hitherto; SPP. reads in his *pada*-text *úddhitā*, and makes no note  
upon the matter; ⌊he had in fact a note stating that his P.P.²J. also  
read *út॰hitā:* but, as appears from his "Corrections" to vol. iv., p.  
446, his note was disordered in printing;⌋ the comm. has instead  
*uddhṛtā*. In **c** all the authorities give *yajñásya táttvaṁ ca* ⌊but  
W's P. *tánvaṁ*⌋, and SPP. retains *táttvaṁ*, without even making the  
necessary emendation of accent to *tattvám;* the comm. also supports it,  
and it is implied in the translation given above; our alteration to  
*yajñáś ca sattráṁ ca* is probably more venturesome than is called for.  
⌊The place of the accent in the ms.-reading *táttvaṁ ca*, the Paris  
reading *tán-*, the un-Vedic look of *tattvam*, the *ṛ́caḥ prā́ñcas  
tántavas* of AV. xv. 3. 6, and the TB. parallel, all join in suggesting  
that the true reading is *yajñásya tántavas*.⌋ In the appendix to the  
verse, the comm. reads *sammitāya*.

Brahma is fatness-dropping scoops: with Brahma was the altar reared. Brahma is worship, lengthened rite, the Rishis who pay sacrifice, the victim's Immolators. Hail!

##### Translation
3. To him who frees from distress I bring forward my devotion  
(*manīṣā́*), unto him who rescues well, choosing to myself his favor;  
accept, O Indra, this oblation; let the desires of the sacrificer be  
realized.

##### Notes
Or (at the end) 'come true.' A corresponding verse is found in TS. (in  
i. 6. 12³) and in MS. (in iv. 12. 3). In **a** both read *bharemā* ⌊p.  
*-ma*⌋ *manīṣā́m*, thus rectifying the meter; and Ppp. does the same; for  
**b**, TS. gives *oṣiṣṭhadā́vne sumatíṁ gṛṇānā́ḥ* ⌊good grammar (plural  
*-nā́s*) and good meter⌋; MS. *bhūyiṣṭhadā́vne sumatím āvṛṇānáḥ* ⌊bad in  
both respects⌋. Very nearly all the AV. authorities give in **b** *-tím  
mā vṛṇānáḥ;* ⌊per contra, cf. note to xviii. 2. 3⌋. One would like to  
get rid of the superfluous *ā́* at the beginning of **b** by emending to  
*āśutrā́vṇe* ⌊*āśu-* would accord closely in sense with the *oṣiṣṭha-* of  
TS.⌋. ⌊Our *bhare* is evidently a corruption due to haplography, which  
has brought in its train the further corruption of *āvṛṇānā́ḥ* to *-náḥ*.  
In **c, d**, TS.MS. agree throughout\* with AV. ⌊save that MS. has  
*juṣasva* for *gṛbhāya*. In **c**, Ppp. has *havyā;* only parts of the  
verse are left in its text; ⌊Roth says the first word is lost⌋. The  
comm. reads *sutrāmṇe* in **a**, *-tiṁ gṛṇānaḥ* (like TS.) in **b**, and  
*havyā* (like Ppp.) in **c**. \*⌊In **c**, the *idám* of the Berlin text  
is an emendation, since all the mss. collated by W. before publication  
have *imám;* and it is confirmed by TS.MS., which give *idám*, and by  
W's subsequently collated O., and apparently also by his L. But SPP.  
prints *imám* without note of variant; and the comm. has *imam*, which  
he makes = *idam* in the sense of *idānīm!*⌋

##### Translation
4. Him who frees from distress, the bull of the worshipful, him that  
shines forth (*vi-rāj*), the first of the sacrifices (*adhvará*), the  
child of the waters, O Aśvins, I call with prayer (*dhī́*); do ye with  
Indra give me Indra-like force.

##### Notes
A corresponding verse in TS. (in i. 6. 12³) reads thus: *prá samrā́jam  
prathamám adhvarā́ṇām aṅhomúcaṁ vṛṣabháṁ yajñíyānām: apā́ṁ nápātam aśvinā  
háyantam asmín nara indriyáṁ dhattam ójaḥ*. It helps us least in the  
critical part of our verse, where the mss. all read *aśvínā huvé*  
⌊*huve, havé*⌋ *dhíya* (p. *dhíyaḥ*) *indriyéṇa ta* (p. *te*) *indr-*.  
The translation follows our emendation (*aśvinā*, with TS.; *dhiyé  
’ndreṇa ma indr-*). SPP. follows the mss. Ppp. nearly agrees with them:  
*aśvināu huve dhiya indriyeṇa na indriyaṁ dhattam ojaḥ*. The comm. has  
*dhiyam* and *dhattām* (but his text, according to SPP., reads  
*dhattam*).
</details>
<details><summary>Griffith</summary>

With prayer I call on him who frees from trouble, Prince of Gods, Splendid, chief of sacrifices, I call the Waters' Child and both the Asvins, Vigour is mine, and strength bestowed by Indra.
