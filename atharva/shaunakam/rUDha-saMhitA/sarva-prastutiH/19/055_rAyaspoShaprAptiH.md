#### Comment
Only the first verse is found in Pāipp. (in xx.). The comm. points out that the hymn is plainly meant to be used in the early morning worship of Agni, but quotes no authority. ⌊As to a seventh verse, see SPP's Critical Notice, vol. i., p. 24, and see under vss. 5 and 7.⌋

##### Translation
1. Night after night bringing to him without mixture, as fodder to a  
horse that stands, let not us, O Agni, thy neighbors, receive harm,  
reveling with abundance of wealth, with food (*íṣ*).

##### Notes
The verse corresponds nearly with VS. xi. 75, also with a verse in TS.  
iv. i. 10¹ and MS. ii. 7. 7. VS. begins **a** with *áhar-ahar* (but śB.  
vi. 6. 4¹ ⌊like KśS. xvi. 6. 2⌋ gives a *pratīka* with *rā́trīṁ-rātrīm*  
instead), TS. reads with us, and MS. has *rā́trīṁ-rātrīm* ⌊and repeats  
the *pratīka* at iii. 1. 9, p. 12¹²⌋. At end of **b**, all have *asmāi*  
unaccented. In **d**, all put *ágne* at the beginning, *‘gne mā́ te  
práti-*. In **a**, all the authorities have *áprayātam* ⌊an isolated  
*-tum* counts for nothing⌋, and so has the text of the comm., according  
to SPP., who prints *áprayātam*. But the comm. in his explanation has  
*aprayāvam*, which he glosses by *apracchidya* or *sāṁtatyena* ⌊which  
harmonizes well with the *sádam ít* of iii. 15. 8 **a**⌋; ⌊the six Yajus  
texts just cited (both verses and *pratīkas*) all read *áprayāvam*, on  
which the Berlin emendation\* rests⌋. ⌊Weber, *Ind. Stud.* xvii. 251,  
cites K. xvi. 7 as reading *rātrīṁ-rātrīm*, with the rest as in VS.; and  
Knauer, Index to MGS., p. 155, adds K. xix. 10 and Kap. S. xxx. 8.⌋ The  
second half of our iii. 15.8 above agrees precisely with our **c, d**  
here; the first half differs a good deal, ⌊having for **a** *viśvā́hā te  
sádam íd bharema*, and ending **b** with *jātavedaḥ* instead of *ghāsám  
asmā́i*. Ppp. has in **a** *aprayāmaṁ*, at end of **b** *agne* for  
*asmāi* (as in our vs. 7), and in **d** *‘gnāi mā te pr-* (intending the  
same as the Yajus texts).  
  
\*⌊Griffith's version of *áprayāvam* is 'with care unceasing' (AV.VS.);  
and Eggeling's is 'unremittingly' (śB.); so also W. at iii. 5. 1 (see  
the note); and in his *Roots* he connects *-yāvam* only with root *yu*  
'separate'; one does not see why he departs from that here:  
nevertheless, the sense 'mix' is well avouched for the root *yu* 'unite'  
with *pra* by JUB. i. 8, *yathā madhunā lājān prayuyād evam* (see JAOS.  
xvi. 88 and 228).—I may add in the proof that even the Anukr. reads  
*aprayātam*, but that the Yajus readings, and the *sádam* it (W.  
'constantly') of iii. 15. 8, seem to place the Berlin emendation beyond  
doubt: and that the Ppp. reading *aprayucchan* at iii. 5. 1 helps to  
establish for the Vulgate not only the form *áprayāvam* as gerund, but  
also the meaning 'without being careless' or 'unremittingly' as against  
'without mixing.'⌋  
  
    
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
2. Of thee that art good what arrow \[is\] in the wind, this is that of  
thine; therewith be gracious to us. Let not us, O Agni, thy neighbors,  
receive harm, reveling with abundance of wealth, with food.  
  
  
  
  
The translation follows the text of the mss. rather than our  
emendations, as the latter afford no more satisfactory sense than does  
the former. Several authorities, however, read *yā́ta* instead of *vā́ta*  
(one has *vā́ca;* one *ī́ṣuḥ*, two *éṣuḥ;* ⌊and so on⌋): the *pada*-mss.  
divide *vā́taḥ: íṣuḥ: sā́*. The comm's text has *iṣa;* but how his  
explanation is related to the text is hard to see: *he agne vāsakasya  
tava yā ’nugrahabuddhir annapradasya yā cā ’nugrahabuddhis tayā ‘smān  
sukhaya;* that is all.

##### Translation
3. Evening after evening \[is\] Agni our house-lord; morning after  
morning \[is he\] giver of well-willing; be thou giver of good to us of  
every kind; may we, kindling thee, adorn (*puṣ*) ourselves.

##### Notes
The third pāda is literally 'of good thing after good thing be thou  
giver of good.' The *pada*-mss. divide *vasu॰dā́naḥ: edhi* instead of  
*vasu°dā́ḥ: naḥ: edhi*, as is implied by our text; the meter makes us  
suspect that the true original reading was *vasudā́no na edhi*. The  
fourth pāda is v. 3. 1 **b** etc. (see under that verse). ⌊Cf. vs. 4.⌋

##### Translation
5. May I be one not falling short of food; to the food-eating lord of  
food, to Agni \[as\] Rudra be homage.

##### Notes
Here also there is discordance as to the verse-division; the Anukr. ⌊and  
comm.⌋ further add to vs. 5 what in our edition is 6 **a, b,** and then  
make one verse of what remains of the hymn; and SPP. follows them. The  
translation adheres to our text (which represents all the mss. till that  
time known to us), especially because its division seems better suited  
to the sense. At the beginning, all the authorities, and SPP., have  
*ápaścādagdhā́nnasya*, divided by the *pada*-text into *ápaścā:*  
*dagdhá॰annasya* (or *-gdha॰án-*); ⌊but Whitney's W. has *daghānt-*; his  
M. has *dagdhvānn-*; and his P. has *dagghvānt-* or possibly  
*dagdhvānt-*, it is not clear which: at any rate, in P. and M. there is  
a *pada* before the ā;⌋ the comm. understands *apaścādagdhā ’nnasya*,  
and solemnly explains it as meaning: *annasyā ’paśca\[dagdhā\]  
paścādbhāge ‘dagdhā sthālīpṛṣṭhabhāge dagdhānnarahitaḥ!* The correctness  
of our conjectural emendation to *ápaścādaghvā́ ’nnasya* is put beyond  
question by the occurrence of a corresponding phrase, *ápaścāddaghvā́  
’nnam bhūyāsam*, in MS. iii. 9. 4, p. 120¹⁷, and also in Āp. vii. 28.  
2.\* Part of the mss. accent *bhūyāsam*. In **b**, all SPP's authorities  
⌊save one⌋, and most of ours, give *annādāyo ‘nn* (variously accented:  
p. *anna॰adáyaḥ*), apparently a case of misunderstanding of *āyā* as  
*yo* after the Bengāli method of writing *o;*† but two of our mss.,  
P.M., have *annādā́yā́ ’nn-*, which is the reading of our text; the comm.  
likewise understands *-dāya*, and SPP. also accepts it in his text.  
\*⌊The phrase *á-paścād-daghvane náre* occurs at RV. vi. 42. 1; TB. iii.  
7. 10⁶; Āp. xiv. 29. 2; compare *apaścā-daghvane naraḥ* at SV. i. 352,  
ii. 790. It may be worth noting that the comm. to TB. brings the epithet  
into connection with food, explaining the phrase as 'a man devoid of  
brightness (i.e. dull) after his meal, unable to digest what he has  
eaten,' *paścād bhakṣottarakālaṁ dīptirahitāya, bhakṣitaṁ jarayitum  
asamarthāya*. He seems to connect *a-..-daghvan* (= *dīptirahita*) with  
*dah;* but BR. and W., with Sāyaṇa on RV., derive it from *dagh:* cf.  
RV. i. 123. 5 **c**; vii. 56. 21 **b**.⌋ †⌊Cf. SPP's notes to xviii. 4.  
48; xix. 32. 10; 48. 1; 56. 3.⌋

##### Translation
6. O thou of the assembly, protect my assembly (*sabhā́*), and \[them\]  
who are of the assembly, sitters in the assembly; having much invoked  
thee, O Indra, may they attain their whole life-time.

Day after day taking tribute to thee, O Agni, as fodder to a horse that stands [, let not us, O Agni, thy neighbors, receive harm, reveling with abundance of wealth, with food (_íṣ_)].

##### Notes
The translation is to be taken simply for what it is worth, as it does  
not follow the mss., nor either printed text. At the beginning, the mss.  
⌊except several of W's, which have the impossible *sabhyá*⌋, SPP., and  
the comm., read *sabhyás*, which might well enough have been left by us  
unchanged, save for accent (viii. 10. 5 *sábhyas*). But the mss. read  
*sabhyás* again later ⌊save two of W's, which have *sabhyā́s*⌋, this time  
SPP. emends to *sabhyā́s* (should be *sábhyās*, with us?), since the  
comm. has this. In **c**, the mss. in general give *tvám indrā* (or  
*índrā*) *puruhūtya* (p. *puru॰hūtya*); the comm's text offers *tvām*  
⌊his exposition: *tvam*⌋ *indra puruhūta;* and SPP. adopts *tvám indrā*  
(p. *indra*) *puruhūta;* our conjecture, *tváyé ’d gā́ḥ puruhūta*, seems  
too violent, and the translation implies *tvā́m indra purū́huya*, with  
*aśnavan* at the end, while the mss., and SPP., have *aśnavat* (the  
comm. has the same, unblushingly explaining it as = *prāpaya*, a mere  
substitution of one person for another!), and our text emended to  
*-vam*, an ungrammatical but not wholly unprecedented form. ⌊The London  
ms. of the Anukr. adds as the *pratīka* of its vs. 6 *tvam indrā  
puruhūtye ’ti* (our 6 **c**: note the reading), but gives no metrical  
definition: the Berlin ms. does not even give the *pratīka*.⌋

None of the mss. have the second half-verse; it was added because it seemed called for by the first half, as in vss. 1 and 2. That the comm. and part of the mss., and so also SPP., in agreement with the Anukr., make only six verses in the hymn, was explained above under vs. 5. A majority of the mss. accent _bálim_ in **a** (including all those used by us before publication), and so the error has got into our text; SPP. has correctly _balím;_ some leave _hárantas_ without accent; the comm. and a ms. or two have _ítye_ for _ít te_ (= _prāptavye gṛhe vartamānāyā ’gnaye_, comm.). All the mss. have in **b** jātám instead of _ghāsám;_ but the comm. has the latter, and it is therefore read in SPP's text as well as in ours.
