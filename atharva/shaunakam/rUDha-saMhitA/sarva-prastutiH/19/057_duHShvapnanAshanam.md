#### Comment
⌊Partly prose—verses 2, 3, 4, and 6.⌋ Pāipp. has only the first verse (in ii.). The comm. quotes from a Pariśiṣṭa (SPP. is unable to identify the passage) a direction for using it (with vi. 45, 46) to a king who sees bad dreams. ⌊As to the connection of the material of this hymn with that of h. 56, see introd. to h. 56.⌋ ⌊As to the differences of division, see under vss. 3, 4, and 5, and cf. SPP's Critical Notice, vol. i., p. 24.⌋

##### Translation
1. As a sixteenth, as an eighth, as a \[whole\] debt they bring  
together, so do we bring together all evil-dreaming on one who is  
offensive (*ápriya*).

##### Notes
The verse is nearly identical with vi. 46. 3, differing only by  
substituting *ápriye* in **d** for *dviṣaté*. *Apriye* comes near to the  
*āptyé* of RV. viii. 47. 17, with which both verses correspond: see note  
to vi. 46. 3. The comm., in fact, reads *āptye*.
</details>
<details><summary>Griffith</summary>

As men discharge the utmost debt, collect the eighth and sixteenth part, So to the foeman we transfer together all the evil dream.

##### Translation
2. Kings have gathered (*sam-gā*), debts have gathered, *kuṣṭhás* have  
gathered, sixteenths have gathered; all evil-dreaming that is in us—let  
us impel away evil-dreaming to him that hates us.

##### Notes
The *pada*-mss. read *sáḥ: mṛṇā́ni* for *sám: ṛṇā́ni*, and *sáḥ: kalā́ḥ*  
(the *saṁhitā*-mss. also *sá kalā́ ag-*) for *sám: kalā́ḥ;* SPP. follows  
us in emending in both places to *sám*, which the comm. also has. At the  
beginning of the second division, we have emended *sám* of the mss. and  
comm. (which SPP. follows) to *sárvam*. For *yát* (after *asmā́su*) the  
*saṁhitā*-mss. read *yáta*, and the *pada*-mss. *yátaḥ;* out *yát* is  
supported by the comm., and SPP. adopts it The comm. says that *kuṣṭha*  
is a skin-disease, symptomatic of various maladies; and, when one of  
these remains unhealed, boils and sores etc. (? *piṭakavraṇādīni*) show  
themselves. Also, that *kalās* are *anupādeyāvayavopalakṣaṇa*, and  
worthless parts of cattle etc. are collected in old pits. And in like  
manner collected ill-dreaming is made over to an enemy. That is his  
idea, and a wholly unacceptable one, of the general meaning of the  
verse. ⌊The verse is prose, no *triṣṭubh;* but may be stretched so as to  
count as 43 syllables.⌋
</details>
<details><summary>Griffith</summary>

Princes came together, debts came together, Kushthas came to- gether, Sixteenths came together. The whole evil dream that hath visited us we send away as a bad dream to the man who hates us.

##### Translation
3. Embryo of the wives of the gods, instrument of Yama, excellent dream;  
the evil \[dream\] that is mine, that do we send forth to him that hates  
us.

##### Notes
The mss. all read *devā́nām pátnīnāṁ gárbha* (one *pada*-mss. *-bham*)  
*yamásya kárayo bhadrásvapnaḥ;* the translation implies no further  
emendation than to *gárbho* and *káraṇo;* ⌊the minor Pet. Lex., iv. 249,  
accepts *bhadrásvapna* as a descriptive compound, although the accent  
(*Gram.* §1280 c) is very exceptional;⌋ SPP., following the comm.,  
changes to *dévānām patnīnāṁ garbha yámasya kara yó bhadráḥ svapna*. Our  
*devápatnīnām* and *káraṇas* were suggested especially by the  
*devajāmīnā́m* and *káraṇas* of vi. 46. 2 and xvi. 5. 6, of which neither  
the comm. nor SPP. take any notice. In the second division of the verse  
the two editions agree, save that ours emends *tát* of the mss. (which  
SPP. follows) to *tám;* and the latter is supported by our P.M., and by  
the comm. But the mss. have at the beginning *samámayaḥ*, and the  
*pada*-mss. resolve it into *samám: ayaḥ*. The Anukr. and comm. and SPP.  
add to this verse what in our text is the first division of vs. 4; our  
division is that of our first mss., and is preferable on the ground of  
the sense. ⌊The prose verse, according to the division of the Anukr.,  
may be made to count (8 + 10: 13: 13?) as 44 syllables.⌋

##### Translation
4. Thee that art "harsh" by name, mouth of the black bird  
(*-śakúni*)—thee, O sleep, we thus know completely; do thou, O sleep, as  
a horse a halter, as a horse a girth, scatter him who is not of us, the  
god-reviler, the mocker.

##### Notes
⌊Prose.⌋ The translation here is of no authority, including various  
venturesome emendations of the text; it follows our text except at the  
end, where, instead of *badhāna*, it implies the (unsatisfactory) *vapa*  
of the comm. and SPP.; all the mss. read *vápus* ⌊or *vápu*⌋. At the  
beginning, the *pada*-mss. give *mā́tṛṣṭā: nāma: asi: kṛṣṇa॰śakune:  
múkham;* and the *saṁhitā*-mss. agree with them, with worthless  
variations of accent ⌊and some slight differences besides⌋, and with  
*-kuner* in one or two. SPP. reads, however, *mā́ tṛṣṭā́nām asi  
kṛṣṇaśakunér múkham*, won, as he claims, by adding accents to the comm's  
text; but this differs from the mss. only by ⌊the word-division and⌋ by  
*-nāmasi* and *-ner;* how the comm. divides and understands  
*mātṛṣṭānāmasi* is unknown, as his explanation of the words is wanting  
(though SPP. notes no lacuna). So much (to *múkham*) is, as was noted  
above, added to vs. 3 by Anukr., comm., and SPP. In the next division of  
the verse, for *kakṣyā̀m*, the mss., the comm., and SPP., give *kāyám*,  
which might mean 'body'; the comm. is apparently imperfect here, reading  
*aśvo yathā svakīyaṁ rajodhūsaraṁ \[kāyaṁ\] dhunoti yathā cā ’śvo  
nīnāham palyāṇakavacādikam avakirati:* with *kāyam* is perhaps omitted  
also *śarīram*, its gloss. Our mss. end vs. 4 with *nīnāhám*, and it was  
our emendation to add the next clause; but this the comm. does also,  
ending with *vapa*, while SPP. goes on to *gṛhe* without making a  
verse-division; the sense (so far as we can be said to understand it)  
favors our division and the comm's. The latter reads *avā ’smākam*,  
finding thus an *ava...vapa*, which he explains by *tiraskuru*. All the  
mss. give *pípāruṁ* ⌊P.M.: *píy-*⌋ *vápur* ⌊or *vápu*⌋ yád etc., with  
not even a pāda-division after *vápus;* such a division was due in our  
text, however, after *nīnāhám*. ⌊The Anukr. seems to intend to count the  
verse (*taṁ tvā* to *gṛhe*) as 9 + 9 + 7 + 13 (reading *vapa*): 8 + 8 =  
54.⌋

Thou whose name is Rough art the mouth of the Black Bird. As such we know thee, Dream, as such we know thee well. Like a horse art thou, O Dream. As they bind girth and surcingle on a horse, so bind the alien mischief-maker, the scorner of the Gods.

##### Translation
5. What evil-dreaming is in us, what in our kine, and what in our house,  
that let him who is not of us, the god-reviler, the mocker, put on like  
a necklace (*niṣká*).

6. Having measured off nine cubits, forth from that do we divide off to him who hates us all our evil-dreaming.


##### Notes
⌊Pādas **a** and **b** are identical with 45. 2 **a, b**, above; and the  
rest of the verse seems to throw much light on 45. 2 **c, d**: see my  
note to that verse. In his Collation-Book, Whitney here made a note of  
this important parallel, but seems to have overlooked his note when  
working out his commentary.⌋ The mss. again all read *pípārus* ⌊P.M.:  
*píy-*⌋; and the comm. again *avā ’smākam*, supplying a *gamaya* to the  
*ava* in his explanation. The omission of *devapīyús* would make a fair  
*anuṣṭubh* of this verse ⌊and a faultless one, if we pronounce  
*niṣkéva*⌋; it is evidently metrical, and a verse by itself ⌊cf. 45. 2⌋  
as it stands in our text; the Anukr. and SPP., with part of the mss.,  
end vs. 4 with *gṛhé*, and throw all the rest of the hymn together as  
vs. 5; the comm. agrees with us as to vss. 5 and 6. ⌊The Anukr. seems to  
intend to count its verse 5 (*anāsmākás tád* to end of hymn) as 12 + 9:  
9 + 7 \[:\] 14 = 51, and to put its second *avasāna*, with some of the  
mss., after *pári*, as does SPP.⌋

⌊Prose.⌋ Instead of our _apamā́ya_, the mss., the comm., and SPP. read _ápamayā_ (p. _ápa॰mayāḥ_) how the comm. (or SPP.) would explain it does not appear, as he gives only the general sense of the expression; _asmākaṁ sambandhi duṣvapnyaṁ navāratniparyantam apasāraya_. He reads at the end _apriye saṁ nayāmasi_ (= 1 **d**).
