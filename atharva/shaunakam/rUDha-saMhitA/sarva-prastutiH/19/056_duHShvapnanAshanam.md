#### Comment
If prámadā (p. prá॰madā) is to be rendered as above, it must have its accent changed to pramádā; the comm., against the pada-text, understands it as pramadās = striyas, joint object with mártyān of prá yunakṣi. One or two mss. read mártān in b. The comm. renders dhīras by dhṛṣṭas. ⌊Apart from Ws P.M.W., which have svā́pnam,⌋ all the mss., the comm., and SPP., read svápnam in d, and the translation follows this rather than our svápna, willing, in so obscure a matter, to stick as closely to the authorities as possible. Ppp., to be sure, gives svapna mi-, but this counts for very little. The comm. understands the verse to be addressed to the demon of ill-dreaming (he duḥsvapnābhimānin krūra piśāca); but his explanations through the whole hymn are worthless, being only the etymologizing guesses of one to whom the real sense is precisely as obscure as it is to us: asura is prāṇavant ātman; the 'lonely one' is the man who is dying of the effect of evil-dreaming, having abandoned son, wife, relatives, etc.; yāsi means yantalokam prāpayasi; and so on, and so on. ⌊Griffith cites "Death and his brother Sleep" of Shelley's Queen Mab (it is found also at Iliad xiv. 231) and "the twins, Sleep and Death," II. xvi. 682.⌋

#### Translation
1. Out of Yama's world hast thou come hither (*ā-bhū*); with mirth (?)  
dost thou, wise, make use of (*pra-yuj*) mortals; knowing, thou goest in  
alliance (*sarátham*) with the solitary one, fashioning (*mā*) sleep in  
the lair (*yóni*) of the Asura.

#### Notes
If *prámadā* (p. *prá॰madā*) is to be rendered as above, it must have  
its accent changed to *pramádā;* the comm., against the *pada*-text,  
understands it as *pramadās* = *striyas*, joint object with *mártyān* of  
*prá yunakṣi*. One or two mss. read *mártān* in **b**. The comm. renders  
*dhīras* by *dhṛṣṭas*. ⌊Apart from Ws P.M.W., which have *svā́pnam*,⌋ all  
the mss., the comm., and SPP., read *svápnam* in **d**, and the  
translation follows this rather than our *svápna*, willing, in so  
obscure a matter, to stick as closely to the authorities as possible.  
Ppp., to be sure, gives *svapna mi-*, but this counts for very little.  
The comm. understands the verse to be addressed to the demon of  
ill-dreaming (*he duḥsvapnābhimānin krūra piśāca*); but his explanations  
through the whole hymn are worthless, being only the etymologizing  
guesses of one to whom the real sense is precisely as obscure as it is  
to us: *asura* is *prāṇavant ātman;* the 'lonely one' is the man who is  
dying of the effect of evil-dreaming, having abandoned son, wife,  
relatives, etc.; *yāsi* means *yantalokam prāpayasi;* and so on, and so  
on. ⌊Griffith cites "Death and his brother Sleep" of Shelley's Queen Mab

#### Translation
2. The all-vigorous bond saw thee in the beginning, in the one day  
before the birth of night; from thence, O sleep, didst thou come  
(*ā-bhū*) hither, hiding thy form from the physicians.

#### Notes
In this verse also, for the reason given above, the translation follows  
the mss. more closely than does our text. Nearly all authorities have at  
the beginning *bandhás;* a couple ⌊the reciters, K. and V.⌋, with the  
comm., *bandhús* (wrong accent ⌊as in vs. 5⌋); Ppp. reads *baṁbhas*. All  
have *viśvácayās* (p. *viśvá॰cayāḥ*), though in some of them the *c*  
could be read as *v;* the comm. is able to make a sense for it:  
*sarvasya cetā, saṁceta, sraṣṭā;* the translation implies *viśvāvayās*,  
as the smallest possible intelligible change; Ppp. presents  
*viśvavathāv* ⌊and *apaśyan*⌋. The *pada*-mss. divide in **b** *rā́tryā:  
jánitaḥ: réke;* the comm. understands, with us, *rā́tryāḥ: jánitoḥ: éke;*  
and SPP. substitutes this in his *pada*-text. *Eke ahni* ⌊which Ppp.  
combines to *eke ‘hni*⌋ might, of course, also be understood as locative  
absolute. Our *tátas* at beginning of **c** was an emendation for *táva*  
of the mss.; the comm. has it (also Ppp.), and SPP. accordingly also  
adopts it in his text. The whole pāda reads in Ppp.: *tatas svapnena  
madhyā ca bhāyatha*. In **d** all the mss. have *bhiṣágbhya r-*, and the  
*pada*-mss. *bhiṣágbhya॰rūpam* (!); only one or two give an accent to  
*rūpám;* the comm. understands *bhiṣágbhyo rūpám*, and SPP. reads this;  
the translation follows it. There is much discordance as to the accent  
of *apagūhamānas*. Ppp. reads *bhiṣajña rūpam apigūh-*. The comm. is a  
grammarian of such sort that he does not accept *éke* as used here for  
the more regular *ékasmin;* but he does accept *ahni* as used, by the  
ordinary license to put one case in place of another, for *ahnas*,  
coördinate in construction with *rātryās;* and *eke* means  
*mānasaprajāpatyādayas*, and is subject of *apaśyan* understood! The  
evil-dreaming hid itself away from the medicine-men, says the comm.,  
lest they should meet it with an efficacious remedy; and something like  
that is possibly the real meaning.

#### Translation
3. He of great kine (?) turned unto the gods away from the Asuras,  
seeking greatness; to that sleep the three-and-thirty ones, having  
attained the sky, imparted over-lordship.

#### Notes
At the beginning, the *saṁhitā*-mss. in general read *bṛhád gā́vā* (p.  
*bṛhát: gā́vā* or *grā́vā*); Ppp. has *vṛhaṁgrāvā* ⌊combining  
*-vāsurebhyo*⌋; the comm. gives *bṛhadgāvā*, as nom. of *-gāvan*,  
deriving it from *gā* 'go'; and SPP. accepts this (*bṛhadgā́vā*, p.  
*bṛhat॰gā́vā*), while at the same time suggesting that *-gavó* may be  
meant, by such a confusion of the two modes of writing *o* as we have  
already more than once ⌊cf. 55. 5 **b** and the note⌋ had occasion to  
conjecture. Ppp. reads *‘bhi* instead of *‘dhi*. There is discordance  
among the mss. as to the accent of *upā ’vartata*. Ppp. reads at end of  
**b** *ṛcchan*. The majority of mss. have in **d** *tráyastriṅśāsá sv-*;  
and part of the *pada*-mss. divide *tráyaḥ॰triṅśāḥ: sáḥ: sv-;* SPP.  
gives *trayastriṅśā́saḥ sv-*, as do we.

#### Translation
4. Not the Fathers, and not the gods, know it, whose (pl.) murmur goes  
about within here; in Trita Āptya did the men (*nṛ́*), the Ādityas,  
taught by Varuṇa, set sleep.

#### Notes
The mss. read at the beginning *nāí ’tā́m* ⌊and so SPP.⌋, the *etā́m* 'it'  
apparently being viewed as relating to *jálpis;* the comm. makes the  
relation plainer by giving in **b** *yāi ’ṣām;* but this latter SPP.  
rejects. At end of **b**, the mss. vary between *antarétám* and *antaré  
’dám* (p. *antarā́: idám*); the comm. gives the latter, and SPP. accepts  
it; Ppp. also has it; ⌊and it is implied in the translation⌋. The mss.,  
as always, vary between *tṛté* and *trité;* the great majority here give  
the former. *Váruṇena* in **d** was our emendation for *ár-*; it is read  
also by the comm., and by one of SPP's mss., and is found in Ppp.; SPP.  
also adopts it in his text. The mss. all accent *ā́dityāsas*, and SPP.  
does not emend, as we do, to *ādityā́sas*. Ppp. reads in **b** *jalpyaś  
c-*, and has for **c** *trite svapnam arididṛhā prate narā* (*ādit-*).  
With **c**, compare RV. viii. 47. 13-17 and especially 15 **c, d**. The  
comm. tells a tale of how *duḥsvapna*, having received overlordship from  
the gods, waxed topping, and seized on the Ādityas; the latter applied  
for relief to Varuṇa, and, duly instructed by him, put off the  
*duḥsvapna* upon the great seer (*maharṣi*) Trita, son of the waters:  
this is pretty plainly no tradition, but an account devised by the comm.  
to fit the immediate case.

#### Translation
5. Of whom the evil-doers shared ⌊*bhaj*⌋ the cruelty, the well-doers,  
by non-sleep, \[shared\] the pure (*púṇya*) life-time—thou revelest in  
the sky (*svàr*) with the highest relative; thou wast born out of the  
mind of one practising fervor.

#### Notes
The translation is a merely literal rendering, and does not pretend to  
be an intelligent one. It implies in **a**, with SPP., a majority of his  
mss., and the comm., *ábhajanta* (the other readings are *apacanta,  
abhacanta, aṣacanta;* and there are varieties of accent); in **b**, all  
the *saṁhitā*-mss. combine *duṣhṛ́to sv-*, implying *asvápnena;* but  
⌊SPP's⌋ *pada*-mss. ⌊and W's *pada*-ms. D., p.m.⌋ read *svápnena;* ⌊W's  
D. seems to be corrected to *asváp-* and his L. also seems to have  
*asváp-*;⌋ SPP. accepts *asváp-*, with the comm. Ppp. gives no help; its  
text is *vy asya krūram abhijanta duṣkṛṇe sv-*; and *āpuḥ* for *āyuḥ* at  
the end of **b**. In **c**, *bandhúnā* (read by both editions, with the  
mss.) ought to have been emended ⌊cf. vs. 2 **a**⌋ to *bándhunā*, as  
both texts emend to *tapyá-* from *tápya-*, which appears in most of the  
mss. At the end, SPP. has the correct *jajñiṣe*, with about ⌊half of his  
authorities, including the carefully corrected Dc.⌋ (and with one of our  
later ones); our *jajñiṣé* represents the rest, but has no reason. Ppp.  
has in **c** *svarasajasi*. The comm. renders *abhajanta* by  
*prāpnuvanti*, and *asvapnena* by *duḥsvapnadarśanābhāvena;* he regards  
*duḥsvapna* as addressed in the second half-verse, and explains *svàr*  
as equivalent to a locative (as rendered above) ⌊cf. *Noun-Inflection*,  
p. 488⌋, and *bandhunā* (cf. 2 **a**) as *sṛṣṭeḥ prākkāle tvāṁ dṛṣṭavatā  
vidhātrā saha*.

#### Translation
6. We know all thine attendants (?) in front; we know, O sleep, who is  
thine over-ruler here; protect us here with the glory of the glorious  
one; go thou away far off with poisons.

#### Notes
In **b**, the *pada*-mss. give blunderingly *svapna॰yáḥ*. Ppp. reads *yo  
‘dhipā hyo te*. Of course, *yaśasvinas* in **c** may be accus. pl., 'us  
who are glorious'; the comm. takes it so, and explains that the glory  
comes from our wonderful knowledge as set forth in the first half-verse.  
⌊Ppp. reads *yaśaso hi* for *yáśase ’há*. In **d**, the *saṁhitā*-mss.  
(also Ppp.) give *ārā́dviṣ;* which is equivalent to *ārā́ddviṣ-*; and the  
*pada*-mss. assume the latter, dividing *ārā́t: dviṣébhiḥ;* since a  
derivative *dviṣá* is as good as unknown, and of a very unusual  
formation, we preferred to read *viṣébhis;* ⌊the comm., text and  
exposition, has *dviṣobhis;*⌋ SPP. has *dviṣébhis*. In **a** the  
translation of *parijā́s* is that of the comm. (= *parijanān*), which  
seems more probable than the conjecture of the Pet. Lexx., "perhaps  
places of origin."
