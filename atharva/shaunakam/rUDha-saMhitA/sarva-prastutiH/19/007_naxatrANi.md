#### Comment
The translation implies our conjectural emendation of turmíśam ⌊two of W's mss., -mich-⌋ in c to aṣṭāviṅśám (or -śā́). ⌊This is supported by the textually unimpeachable aṣṭaviṅśā́ni of 8. 2 a, and the fact that the series in this hymn is actually of 28 members, as noted in the introduction.⌋ The comm. has turmiśām, and gives for it a double etymology and explanation: either it is turmi + śā, or it is tur + miśā; in the former case, turmi is from root turv, and means "injuring" (hiṅsaka), and śā is the root śā 'sharpen,' hence "make thin"; in the latter case, tur is ⌊a root-stem from⌋ root turv, and miśā is by Vedic license for miṣā, from root miṣ "contend" (spardhāyām); in either case, the compound means "putting down oppressors," and is adjective qualifying sumatim! All the mss. accent saparyā́mi, and SPP. admits it in his text; the accent is defensible, and would be required by Brāhmaṇa usage. Our emendation in c helps the meter as well as the sense; but no stress can be laid upon the circumstance that the Anukr. appears to regard the verse as a full triṣṭubh.

#### Translation
1. Seeking favor of the twenty-eight-fold (?) wondrous ones, shining in  
the sky together, ever-moving, hasting in the creation (*bhúvana*), I  
worship (*sapary*) with songs the days, the firmament (*nā́ka*).

#### Notes
The translation implies our conjectural emendation of *turmíśam* ⌊two of  
W's mss., *-mich-*⌋ in **c** to *aṣṭāviṅśám* (or *-śā́*). ⌊This is  
supported by the textually unimpeachable *aṣṭaviṅśā́ni* of 8. 2 **a**,  
and the fact that the series in this hymn is actually of 28 members, as  
noted in the introduction.⌋ The comm. has *turmiśām*, and gives for it a  
double etymology and explanation: either it is *turmi* + *śā*, or it is  
*tur* + *miśā;* in the former case, *turmi* is from root *turv*, and  
means "injuring" (*hiṅsaka*), and *śā* is the root *śā* 'sharpen,' hence  
"make thin"; in the latter case, *tur* is ⌊a root-stem from⌋ root  
*turv*, and *miśā* is by Vedic license for *miṣā*, from root *miṣ*  
"contend" (*spardhāyām*); in either case, the compound means "putting  
down oppressors," and is adjective qualifying *sumatim!* All the mss.  
accent *saparyā́mi*, and SPP. admits it in his text; the accent is  
defensible, and would be required by Brāhmaṇa usage. Our emendation in  
**c** helps the meter as well as the sense; but no stress can be laid  
upon the circumstance that the Anukr. appears to regard the verse as a  
full *triṣṭubh*.

#### Translation
2. Easy of invocation for me \[be\] the Kṛittikās and Rohiṇī; be  
Mṛigaśiras excellent, \[and\] Ārdrā healthful (*śám*) be the two  
Punarvasus pleasantness, Pushya what is agreeable, the Āśleshās light  
(*bhānú*), the Maghās progress (*áyana*) ⌊for me⌋.

#### Notes
The translation again implies in **a** the emendation *me* for *agne*,  
made in our text, for the improvement both of sense and of meter; SPP.  
reads *agne;* and the comm. points out that Agni is invoked here because  
he is the deity of Kṛttikās, and that the deities also of the other  
asterisms are to be regarded as included in their invocations—which is  
quite ingenious. The mss. in **b** are divided between *śám* and *sám;*  
in **c**, between *púṣyas* and *puṣyàs;* SPP. gives *púṣyas*, with, as  
he reports, nearly all his authorities; and this is doubtless the better  
supported reading. There seems to be no good reason for imagining that  
*áyana* in **d** contains any hidden reference to the solstice (in later  
astronomical language, *ayana*, by abbreviation for *ayanānta* 'end of a  
\[northern or southern\] progress of the sun') as occurring in Maghās.

#### Translation
3. Be the former Phalgunīs and Hasta here auspicious (*púṇyam*); be  
Chitrā propitious, and Svāti easy (*sukhá*) for me; be the two Viśākhās  
bestowal (*rā́dhas*), Anurādhā easy of invocation, Jyeshṭhā a good  
asterism, Mūla uninjured.

#### Notes
There are sundry difficulties in this verse, in part attempted to be  
removed by emendation in our edition. It is very strange to find in  
**a** the former Phalgunīs distinctly mentioned, and the latter  
(*uttara*) as distinctly left out; it would be easy to put the *dvayā́*  
of 5 **b** in place of *pū́rvā* here;\* or one wonders whether *uttara*  
is not somehow hidden in the awkwardly redundant *átra*. All the mss.  
(both *saṁh.* and *pada*) agree in the ungrammatical ⌊ending *-tí* of⌋  
*svātí*, and SPP. accordingly admits *svātí* into his text: ours emends  
to *svātís:* *svātī́* would have been equally acceptable, and is  
supported by two of SPP's śrotriyas ⌊V. and K.⌋ and by the comm. The  
masc. *sukhás* (p. *su॰kháḥ*) can hardly be tolerated; we ought to have  
*sukhám*, or else, with the comm., *sukhā́*. All the mss. read in **c**  
*rā́dhe*, as if there were an adjective *rā́dha;* SPP. and the comm. read  
*rā́dhe*, the latter explaining it as another name for *viśākhe* (not a  
word defining the expected blessing!): this involves an anachronism,†  
and would be in the highest degree improbable even if it did not:  
*rā́dho* is a very easy and plausible improvement. Finally, all the mss.  
have in **d** *áriṣṭa mū́lam* ⌊cf. note to xviii. 2. 3⌋, which SPP.  
adopts, in spite of its utter ungrammaticalness; the comm., with his  
usual disregard of *pada*-text and accent, appears to understand  
*ariṣṭamūlam*, a compound. \*⌊Or rather to put *dvayé?* The comm.  
renders *pū́rvā* by *pūrve*, for which *pū́rvā* is a bad reading or a  
worse solecism. But the position of ca*,* too, is very suspicious.⌋ †⌊I  
suppose Whitney's implication is that *rādhā*, as a name for the 14th  
(or 16th) asterism *viśākhā*, is a later one, based on a  
misunderstanding of the name of the 15th (or 17th) asterism, *anurādhā*,  
which word simply means 'success' (cf. *ánv eṣām arātsmé ’ti: tád  
anūrādhā́ḥ*, TB. i. 5. 2⁸), but was thought of as meaning the one 'after  
(*anu*) or following *rādhā*.'⌋

#### Translation
4. Let the former Ashāḍhās give me food; let the latter ones bring  
refreshment; let Abhijit give me what is auspicious; let śravaṇa \[and\]  
the śravishṭhās make good prosperity.

#### Notes
Here are more bad readings: in **a**, the mss. give *pū́rvā rāsatām*, and  
SPP. accepts the reading, as if *rāsatām* could be 3d du. act., which,  
in view of all the circumstances, is absurd; our emendation to *-ntām*  
is unavoidable.\* In **b**, the mss. vary between *dehy útt-* ⌊all of  
Whitney's and most of SPP's⌋ and *devy útt-*, and SPP. adopts the  
latter, because the comm. has it; but then the comm. makes no difficulty  
of understanding it as = *devyas;* it is merely, in his opinion, a Vedic  
substitution of sing. for pl.; and it is to be hoped that no modern  
scholar would follow him in that. The emendation of our text to *yé hy  
úttare*,† considering that all our mss. (and all but two of SPP's  
authorities) have *úttare* (p. *út॰tare*), was a naturally suggested and  
easy one; but we need instead *yā́ hy úttarā ā́*, feminine words, like the  
*pū́rvās* ⌊the *pada*-mss. and the Anukr. read *pū́rvā* in **a**; SPP.  
reads *úttarās*, with the comm. and two of his reciters. The meter of  
**d** would be better if we had *śróṇas* for *śrávaṇas;* but the Anukr.  
acknowledges the redundancy of the verse.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
\*⌊SPP. seems rather to view *rāsatām* in **a** as of the plural number,  
3d person imperative middle, = *dadatu* (the ms. of the comm. has in  
fact *dadātu*, singular): and plural 3d it might be (from the *s*-aorist  
tense-stem *rās*, used as a secondary root: *Gram.* §896), thus  
conforming in number with *vahantu*. On the other hand, we cannot take  
*rāsatām* in **c** otherwise than as of the singular number, 3d person  
imperative middle of the *a*-conjugation, present-stem *rāsa:* and the  
identical form in **a** ought, one would think, to be of the same value.  
If we take it as singular, and read *aṣāḍhā́* as fem. and sing, so as to  
conform with *pū́rvā* (p. *pū́rvā*), then pāda **b** is intolerably out of  
congruity with **a** in the matters of gender and number.—I offer the  
following suggestions for what they may be worth. First, in spite of the  
(unauthoritative) *pada*-reading *út॰tare*, I would take the *úttarā ā́*  
of the living reciters K.V. as representing a correct metrical utterance  
of úttarā́ (= *út॰tarā: ā́*). Secondly, for *vahantu* I would read  
*vahātu* (cf. *svadātu, nudātu, muñcātu*): this seems to me better than  
a possible *vahāti*, and does as little violence to the tradition as the  
*rāsantām* and *yé hy úttare* suggested above. If our *vahantu* is a  
corruption, it may well be a faulty assimilation (cf. end of ¶4 of note  
on xviii. 4. 87) of *vahātu* to the ending of vs. 5 **d**.—My text then  
would be as follows: *ánnam pū́rvā* (p. *-vā*) *rāsatām* (as 3d sing.)  
*me aṣāḍhórjam* (p. *-ḍhā́: ū́r-*) *devy úttarā́ vahātu* (p. *devī́: úttarā:  
ā́: vahātu*): 'may the Former Ashāḍhā give me food; may the Latter, the  
divine one, bring refreshment.'⌋ †⌊'appears from the Collation Book that  
RW. meant in fact to print *yé hy útta-*: but the Berlin ed. has  
actually *yé hy ùtta-*, an accent-mark having perhaps slipped to the  
left, over *hyu* from over *tta*.⌋
