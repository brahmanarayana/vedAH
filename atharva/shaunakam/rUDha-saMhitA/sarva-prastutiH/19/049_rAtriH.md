#### Translation
1. The lively woman, household maiden, night, of god Savitar, of Bhaga,  
all-expanded, of easy invocation, of assembled fortune (? *-śrī́*), hath  
filled heaven-and-earth with greatness.

#### Notes
In **a**, the *pada*-mss. read *dámūnā;* SPP. emends to *-náḥ*. In  
**c**, all the mss., with the comm. and SPP., read *aśvakṣabhā́* (p.  
*aśva॰kṣabhā́*), which, as being unintelligible, our edition emends at a  
venture to *viśvávyacās*, and the translation follows the latter, for  
lack of anything better. The comm. gives two explanations: *aśu* (=  
*āśu*) + *akṣa* + *bhā* (= *abhibhavati* or *tiraskaroti*), meaning  
*śīghrapravṛtticakṣurādinirodhikā;* or, alternatively, by analogy with  
vs. 4 **c**, *aśvakṣā* (= *aśvān kṣāyati* or *kṣapayati*) *bhā* (=  
*dīptiḥ*) *yasyāḥ sā:* both as absurd as possible. Ppp. reads  
*aśvakṣarā*. Many of the mss. read *sámbhṛtaḥśrīr*, and the *pada*-mss.  
divide falsely *sám॰bhṛtaśrīḥ* instead of *sámbhṛta॰śrīḥ;* SPP. follows  
them. Ppp. reads *saṁbhṛtaḥśīr ā*.

#### Translation
2. The profound one hath surmounted all things; the most mighty one hath  
ascended to the loftiest sky; the eager night spreads toward me like a  
friend with excellent *svadhā́s*.

#### Notes
The translation follows our text of the verse, which, however, is full  
of emendations, and by no means satisfactory. Nearly every ms. reads at  
the beginning *ávi* (one *áviṁ*, and one authority ⌊SPP's reciter V.,  
with impossible accent⌋ *ábhi*), while Ppp. has *abhi*, which is also,  
except for the accent, an easier emendation for *ávi*. The comm. has  
*ati*. Nearly all authorities, again, have for verb in **a** *áruhat*  
(the accent is perfectly defensible as an antithetical one, and might  
well have been left in our text); but the reciter V. gives (*ábhi*)  
*árhat*, thus agreeing in part with the (*ati*) *arhat* of the text of  
the comm.; ⌊and one of W's mss. has *ásahat*⌋. The explanation of the  
comm. reads *atyarhati*, which he glosses by *atikramya vyāpya vartate*,  
which is wholly without authority, since even the Dhātūpaṭha gives only  
*pūjāyām* as the sense of *arh*. Ppp. has *aruhat*. SPP. goes half way  
with the comm., adopting *áti...aruhat* (unnecessarily abandoning the  
"ancient accent" of the verb). All authorities have *víśvāni* (but Ppp.  
only *viśvā ar-*); and all ⌊save Ppp. again⌋ have *gambhīró*, p. *-ráḥ*,  
⌊but one of W's pada-mss. gives *-rā*, p.m.⌋, although the comm.,  
again.st his own text (according to SPP.), explains *gambhīrā*. Here  
perhaps Ppp. brings help, reading *gabhīro ’d varṣ-;* this is better  
than our *-rā́ = rā́: ā́*. ⌊The *gabhīrā́* of the Berlin ed. seems to be a  
misprint for *gambhīrā́*, if we judge by the Collation Book and the Index  
Verborum: but it may be intended as an emendation, as it certainly is a  
metrical improvement.⌋ SPP. reads *gambhīró vá-*, although *gambhīrás*  
is simply unusable, and the change to *-rā́* as easy as possible. Nearly  
all, including Ppp., read *várṣiṣṭham*, ⌊save three of SPP's authorities  
and one of W's, which have *-ṣiṣṭam*⌋. Then follows in nearly all  
*aruhántas*, p. *aruhántaḥ;* but *-háta* is found in one, *-hánta* in  
two, and *arháti* is given by a reciter, with the comm.; the comm. has  
*arhati*, and explains it precisely as he did his *ati...arhati* above;  
SPP. emends to *aruhanta;* our ⌊ā́...⌋ *dyā́m aruhat* is very bold, but  
the case was a desperate one. Ppp. reads *aruhad aśraviṣṭhā*, and this,  
with emendation to *áśramiṣṭhā* (cf. RV. iv. 4. 12), makes acceptable  
sense. One of SPP's mss. has *śramiṣṭhā́*, but doubtless only by  
accident; all the other authorities, including the comm., have ⌊apart  
from some unimportant details⌋ *śraviṣṭhā́*, which SPP. emends to  
*śráviṣṭhāḥ*. There was probably no sufficient reason for our changing  
*śrav-* to *śav-* in our text. The fairly acceptable and least altered  
version of the line would be this: *abhí víśvāny áruhad gambhīró ’d  
várṣiṣṭham aruhad áśramiṣṭhā*. The third pāda is in equally bad  
condition. All the authorities ⌊with unimportant variants⌋, including  
Ppp., have at the beginning *uśatī́ rā́try* (*a-*), but the *pada*-mss.  
give *rā́tri* instead of *rā́trī*, as they should give, and as SPP's  
*pada*-text reads by emendation. What follows it the *pada*-mss. offer  
as *ánu॰sāma: drā́him* (or *drāhím*); in the *saṁhitā*-mss. the first  
word appears as *ánusāma* (once *ánusama*) or (accentless, and so making  
one word with *-drā́him* or *-drā́hi*) *anusāma-* or *aṁnusāma-*; and the  
second appears as *-drā́him*, *-drā́hi*, *drā́him*, *drā́hím*, *drāhí*,  
*drā́vi*, *prā́him*. The rest of the half-verse, *tiṣṭhate mitrá iva  
svadhā́bhiḥ*, is the same in all, including the comm. and Ppp. SPP.  
emends to *ánu sā́ bhadrā́ ’bhí ti-*, which appears to be modeled on our  
*ánu mā bhadrā́bhir ví ti-*, but is defective both in sense and in meter.  
The comm. gives *anukṣaṇaṁ vi ti-*, cutting loose entirely from the  
ms.-reading; his own text, according to SPP., has *anusāmadrā vi ti-*.  
Ppp., finally, has *avasāna bhadrād vi ti-*, which suggests the  
emendation *uśatī́ rā́try ávasā no bhadrā́ ví tiṣṭhate* etc. Our *ví  
tiṣṭhate*, at any rate, is by the support of Ppp. and the comm. put  
nearly beyond question. ⌊I have made some modifications in the above  
paragraph which I could not well indicate by the ell-brackets.—For those  
who do not have the Bombay ed., it may be well to give SPP's  
reconstructions of the verse: first, the text of the comm.: *ati viśvāny  
arhad gambhīro varṣiṣṭham arhati śraviṣṭhā: uśatī rātry anusāmadrā vi  
tiṣṭhate mitra iva svadhābhih;* second, the text which the comm.  
actually explains: *ati viśvāny arhati gambhīrā varṣiṣṭham arhati  
śraviṣṭhā: uśatī rātry anukṣaṇaṁ vi tiṣṭhate mitra iva svadhābhiḥ;*  
third, SPP's reading: *áti viśvāny aruhad gambhīró várṣiṣṭham aruhanta  
śráviṣṭhāḥ: uśatī́ rā́try* (p. *rā́trī*) *ánu sā́ bhadrā́ ’bhi tiṣṭhate mitrá  
iva svadhā́bhiḥ*.⌋

#### Translation
3. O desirable, welcome, well-portioned, well-born one! thou didst come,  
O night; mayest thou be well-willing here; save thou for us the things  
that are produced (*jātá*) for men, likewise what \[are\] for cattle, by  
prosperity ⌊*puṣṭyā́*⌋.

#### Notes
⌊Or, '\[and\] prosperous,' if we read *puṣṭā́*.⌋ The mss. all read in  
**a** *várye*, which we need not have altered to *vā́rye*, as *várya* is  
found elsewhere as early as TB.; Ppp. has *niryāi*. Three of SPP's  
authorities and one of ours have *vándye*, ⌊one has *véde*⌋, the rest  
with Ppp., *vánde;* the comm. *vade* (= *sarvāir abhiṣṭūyamāne*). Ppp.  
has *svajātā*. In **b**, most of the mss. begin with *ā́jā́gan* (one  
*ájā́gan;* p. *ā́: jā́: agan*), and the true reading is in all probability  
*ā́ ’jāgan*, impf. intensive of *gam;* or, if left as "pluperfect," as in  
our edition, it should at any rate be *ā́ ’jagan*, as SPP., with the  
comm., reads. *Rātri* is our (evidently called-for) emendation for  
*rā́tri* of the mss., which SPP. follows. *Syās*, at the end of **b**, is  
also for *syām* of the mss., the comm., and SPP.; it is an obvious  
improvement, though not quite necessary ⌊and receiving no support from  
Ppp.: see below⌋. Ppp. has a peculiar (and corrupt) version: *ā* (if  
*svajātā*, as quoted above, is for *svajāta ā*) *cāgni rātri sumanā hy  
asyām*. In **c**, the translation implies emendation of *asmā́ṅs* to  
*asmé*, against all the authorities, including Ppp. and the comm. The  
*pada*-mss. read *jātā́ḥ*, their natural inference from the rare and  
anomalous combination *jātā́ átho;* SPP. emends to *jātā́*. In **d**, Ppp.  
reads *śriyā* instead of *atho*, and at the end *puṣṭyā*, with all the  
mss. (they vary only as to its accent), and with SPP.; our conjectural  
emendation *puṣṭā́* is supported only by the comm. ⌊text and  
explanation⌋.

#### Translation
4. The eager night has taken to herself the splendor of the lion, of the  
stag, of the tiger, of the leopard, the horse's bottom, man's (*púruṣa*)  
roar (? *māyú*); many forms thou makest for thyself, shining out.

#### Notes
The saṁhitā-mss. accent *rātry uśatī́* (p. *rātri: uśatī́*); SPP. emends,  
with us, to *rā́try uśatī́;* the comm. also understands *rā́trī*. The mss.  
all ⌊with trifling variations⌋ read *pīṣásya* or *pīṅsásya* (or  
*ṣīṣásya*); SPP. accepts *pīṅsásya;* the comm. gives *piṣasya*, which is  
doubtless only a bad spelling of our *piśásya;* ⌊lion and stag are  
mentioned by these names together at RV. i. 64. 8;⌋ Ppp. has *nipasya;*  
and, at end of **b**, *varcādhe*. In **c**, all the authorities,  
including Ppp. ⌊but not the comm.⌋, offer *bradhnám;* the translation  
implies correction to *budhnám*,\* which is the reading of the  
commentator (he explains it as = *mūlam*) ⌊and adds, *aśvavīryasya vego  
hi mūlam;* in vi. 38. 4 we had the horse's *vā́ja* and man's *māyú*  
combined; and TB. (ii. 7. 7¹) in the corresponding passage reads  
*krándye* for *vā́je*. The comm. explains *māyúm* as *śabdam  
āhvānādilakṣaṇam*. Ppp. has *kṛṇuṣī* for *-ṣe*. ⌊The majority of the  
authorities read *vibhātī́ḥ* at the end.⌋ \*⌊Cf. *áśvabudhna*, RV. x. 8.  
3; and Aufrecht on *áśvabudhya*, ZDMG. xxiv. 206.⌋

#### Translation
5. Propitious to me \[be\] night and \[the time\] after sunrise; be the  
mother of cold (*himá*) easy of invocation for us; notice, O  
well-portioned one, this song of praise, with which I greet thee in all  
the quarters.

#### Notes
The translation implies in a a new conjectural reading: *śivā́ me rā́try  
anūsūryáṁ ca;* an accusative is opposed by the connection, and the meter  
needs another syllable. *Anūtsūryá* is venturesome, but we had  
*otsūryám*, p. *ā॰utsūryám*, above, at iv. 5. 7. At any rate, neither  
our text nor that of SPP. (*śivā́ṁ rā́trim anusū́ryaṁ ca*) seems to give  
any sense. Ppp. supports the mss.: *śivāṁ rātrim ahni sūryaṁ ca;* the  
majority of the *saṁhita*-mss. have *śivā́ṁ rā́trim ahi sū́-*, others *anu*  
for *ahi* (p. *śivā́m: rā́trim: anu॰sū́ryam: ca*); the comm. has  
*rātrimahi*, and understands it as *rātri* (voc.) *mahi* (= *mahāntam*,  
and qualifying *sūryam!*). ⌊SPP. suggests *śivā́ rā́trī mahī́ sū́ryaś ca*.⌋  
In **b**, Ppp. has *yamasya*. In **c**, nearly all the mss. read *aśvá*  
(or *áśva*) for *asyá;* and the *pada*-mss. treat it as an independent  
word; SPP. has *asyá*, with us. In **d**, a few mss. have *vándye* or  
*vádye*. Ppp. reads at the end *vikṣu*.

#### Translation
6. Our song of praise, O shining (*vibhā́van*) night, like a king thou  
enjoyest; may we be having all heroes, may we become having all  
possessions, through (*ánu*) the out-shining dawns.

#### Notes
The mss. read at the end *anūṣásaḥ* (p. *anu॰uṣásaḥ*); SPP. emends as we  
had done. Ppp., in **b, c, d**, has, *joṣasī yathā nas sarvavīrā bh-*.  
The verse is very ill described by the Anukr.; it is a good *pan̄kti*  
with one syllable wanting in **c**.

#### Translation
7. Pleasant names thou assumest:—whoso desire to damage my riches, them,  
O night, do thou burn continually, so that no thief be found, so that he  
be not found again.

#### Notes
The translation follows our text, which is considerably altered from  
that of the mss. All of them, with the comm. and SPP., have at the  
beginning *śámyā*, for which our *rāmyā́* is, so far as the written form  
is concerned, a very easy emendation. The comm. explains: "thou wearest  
the name *śamyā* = *śatruśamanasamarthā*": one of his usual absurdities.  
Ppp. reads for **a, b** *śramyā ha nāma taruṣe vimṛcchantī yo janāṅ*.  
There seems to be no good reason why *dadhiṣé* should be accented.  
Nearly all the mss. give *dhánāḥ* at end of **b**; the comm. understands  
*dhanā*, and SPP. reads it. For **c** the *pada*-text is *rā́trī: hitā́*  
⌊or *hi: tā́*⌋: *naḥ: suta॰pā́!* The comm. understands instead *rā́trī ’hí  
tā́n asutapā́*, and SPP. follows him, making a new *pada*-text to  
correspond (*rā́tri: ihí: tā́n: asu॰tapā́*). The comm. explains *asutapā*  
as either "burning their life-breaths" (*asu-tapa*) or "badly burning"  
(*a-su-tapa*). Ppp. gives no help, reading ⌊for our **c**, **d, e**: it  
is not clear just how much of the reading is to be assigned to **c**⌋  
*rātri hīrcāna sadamātasteno anvavidyate*. Our emendation is fairly  
acceptable; but the *hí* ⌊which, with the imperative, hardly needs a  
separate word in translation⌋ requires that we accent *anutápa*. For our  
*yáthā*, in **d** and **e**, the mss. and SPP. give the first time *yás*  
and the second time *yát;* the comm. both times *yas;* the meter and  
sense alike call for our emendation. Ppp. has for both pādas only *ta  
steno anv avidyate*, ⌊which might (see above) be understood as *atas  
steno* etc.⌋.

#### Translation
8. Excellent art thou, O night, like a decorated bowl; thou bearest  
\[as\] maiden the whole form of kine; full of eyes, eager, \[thou  
showest\] me wondrous forms; thou hast put on (*prati-muc*) the stars of  
heaven (*divyá*).

#### Notes
Of this verse also the translation is a make-shift, following in part  
the mss. and in part our conjectural emendations. In **a** the only  
point of question is the last word, which the mss. read as *ṣiṣṭás* (so  
the majority) or *śiṣṭas* or *viṣṭás* ⌊etc.⌋: the comm. has *viṣṭas* (=  
*bhojanārtham pariviṣṭas*). Ppp. gives the whole pāda as *bhadrā ’si  
rātris tapaso nu viṣṭo*. In **b**, nearly all the mss. give *víśvaṁ  
górūpaṁ yuvatir* ⌊several have *-tím*⌋ *bibharṣi* (one has *bíbh-*), and  
this the translation follows, alterations not seeming to supply a better  
sense. SPP., however, follows the comm. in offering *víṣvan̄* for  
*víśvam* (in *saṁhitā* he prints it incorrectly *víṣvaṁ gó-*, as if  
there were an assimilated final in the case); ⌊but in his Corrections at  
the end of vol. iv. he duly notes the error;⌋ he would hardly accept the  
comm's interpretation, = *viṣūcī* (one gender for another); but how he  
would render it, it is hard to see. Ppp. reads *viśvaṁ gorūpaṁ yuvatid  
vibharṣi*, but another hand has written above *-tir bibha-*. In **c**,  
nearly all the mss. (including the comm's text, as stated by SPP.) leave  
*me* unchanged before *uśatī́* and SPP. accepts it in his text, though  
against all rule and practice; two of our mss. have *ma*. ⌊All the  
authorities give *cákṣuṣmatī*, and this is followed by the comm. and  
SPP., and also by W. in the translation, therein departing from the  
emendation ('to me having eyes') of the Berlin ed.⌋ Ppp. has for the  
pāda *cakṣuṣmatī ve yuvatī ’va rūpaḥ*. The translation supplies a verb,  
as seems necessary unless the text be still further altered. For **d**  
the general ms.-reading is *práti tyā́ṁ divyā́ tákmā amukthāḥ* (also  
*tvám* and *tvā́* for *tyā́m*, and *takmā́;* p. *takmā̀ḥ* or *-mā́ḥ*); but  
the comm. offers *práti tváṁ divyā́ ná kṣā́m amukthāḥ*, and this SPP.  
accepts ⌊accenting thus⌋ and prints. Ppp. has *pratyāṁ dityāṁ divyām  
arukṣam amugdhaḥ*. The comm's version of the text is senseless, and his  
attempt to put meaning into it very absurd; it might suggest *práti tváṁ  
divyā́ nákṣatrāṇy amukthāḥ*. Our text ought to accent *tā́rakā am-*, if  
the reading is admitted.

#### Translation
9. What thief shall come today, \[what\] malicious mortal villain, may  
night, going to meet him, smite away the neck, ⌊away⌋ the head of him;—

#### Notes
The two following pādas ⌊10 **a, b**⌋ evidently belong to this verse  
rather than to verse 10; but our division is that of the mss. and the  
Anukr., and so is adopted also by SPP. The comm. inserts another line  
after our 9 **a, b**: *yo mama rātri surūpa āyati sa sampiṣṭo apāyati;*  
and then he divides the four lines that follow into two verses of four  
pādas each, giving eleven verses to the whole hymn. The majority of mss.  
accent *martyás* in **b**. The comm. reads *harat* for *hanat* at the  
end. Ppp. has *yu dya stenā yutv aghāyu mṛtyo ripuḥ;* and, in **d**,  
*pra gīyasva pra*. Pāda **a** is the **a** of iv. 3. 5, ⌊of which the  
**b** recurs here as the second pāda of the comm's inserted line and  
also as the fourth pāda of our vs. 10⌋.

#### Translation
10. ⌊Away⌋ his feet, that he may not go; ⌊away⌋ his hands, that he may  
not harm.

#### Notes
What marauder shall approach, may he go away all crushed; may he go  
away, may he go well away; may he go away in a dry place (?).  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
At the end of **b**, the majority of mss. read *yáthā́śiṣaḥ*, which all  
the *pada*-mss. resolve into *yáthā: áśiṣaḥ;* ⌊most of⌋ the rest, and  
SPP., give *yáthā́ ’śiṣat;* the comm. *yathā ”śliṣat* (= *saṁśleṣayet*).  
Ppp. offers *pra pādāu na yat āhataṣ pra hastāu na yanāśiṣat*. In **e**,  
the *pada*-mss. compound *su॰ápāyati*, doubtless wrongly; ⌊read as  
*pada*-text *sú: ápa: ayati*⌋. All the mss., the comm., and SPP., give  
in **f** *sthāṇāú*, and the comm. explains it as =  
*śākhopaśākhārahitavṛkṣamūla āśraye*. After it, the mss. have *apā́yataḥ*  
(p. *apa॰áyataḥ*), but the comm. agrees with us in *ápā ’yati*, and SPP.  
accordingly also adopts it. The translation follows throughout the  
emendations of our text; perhaps, in **f**, *sthā́ne* would be better  
than *sthalé*, as more closely resembling the ms.-reading. We are  
deprived of the help of Ppp. upon the point, as it skips from *apāyati*  
in **e** to *tṛṣṭadhūnam* in 50. 1 **a**; for **c, d**, it had *yo  
mulalaṁ sulapāyati sa saṁpiṣṭyo upāyati*. We had **d** above as iv. 3. 5  
**b**; ⌊cf. the end of the note to vs. 9⌋.
