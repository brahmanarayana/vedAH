### Translation
4. He who, being permitted by a thus-knowing Vrātya, makes oblation,—

### Notes
*Prājāpatyā* and *sāmny anuṣṭubh* are each of sixteen syllables; what  
the Anukr. means by its use of both terms in regard to this verse and  
not in regard to vs. 3 is difficult to see. ⌊His words are...*iti dve  
prājāpatyānuṣṭubhāu; dvitīyā sāmnī; tatho ’bhe bhurijāu*. He appears to  
set up a class of two vss. (3 and 4) of 17 syllables (16 + 1) each: from  
which he then proceeds to except one vs. (4) by saying that it is  
*sāmnī* or has only 16. He might have expressed himself much less  
awkwardly by writing (instead of the last two clauses) *pūrvā bhurik*.⌋
