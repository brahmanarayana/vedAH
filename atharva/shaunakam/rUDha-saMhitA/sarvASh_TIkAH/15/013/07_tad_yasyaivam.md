### Translation
7. ⌊12.⌋ He may draw him, and he may not draw him.

### Notes
That is, apparently, whether he invite him urgently or not. But the Pet.  
Lex. takes the verb as meaning 'treat with violence, punish'—which is  
unacceptable, as the entertainer is not supposed to be certain whether  
his guest is a real Vrātya or not. Aufrecht leaves the verse  
untranslated. There is ⌊with this interpretation⌋ no perceptible reason  
why the second *kárṣet* should be accented. Another interpretation,  
however, may be suggested as possible: that *kárṣed enam* is apodosis to  
the preceding verse: 'he may tousle (maltreat) him'; and the rest,  
protasis to vs. 8: 'if he do not tousle him' (because he is not  
sufficiently certain of his real character), then he may pay him honors  
under protest, as stated in vs. 8. But then we should expect vs. 7 to be  
divided into two pādas, which is done neither by the *pada*-mss. nor by  
the Anukr.
