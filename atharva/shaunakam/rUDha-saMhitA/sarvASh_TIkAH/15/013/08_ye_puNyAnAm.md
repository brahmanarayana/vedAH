### Translation
8. ⌊13.⌋ For this deity I ask water; this deity I cause to abide; this,  
this deity I wait upon—with this thought he should wait upon him.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
That is, my attentions are meant for the deity whom a Vrātya represents,  
and not for this particular individual. ⌊See above, p. 770, top.⌋ The  
repetition *imā́m imā́m* is very strange, and seems unmotived. The  
*pada*-text sets its *avasāna*-'mark, as if denoting a *pada*-division,  
both times between *imā́m* and *devátām*, in palpable violation of the  
sense.

He should serve him with food saying to himself, To this Deity I offer water: I lodge this Deity; I wait upon this, this Deity.
