### Translation
8. The chant (*sā́man*) the seat, the *udgīthá* the support (?).

### Notes
The translation implies that *udgīthò ‘paśrayáḥ* at the end (p. *-tháḥ:  
apa॰śrayáḥ*) is a corruption for *-thá upaśrayáḥ*, this being favored by  
*udgītha upaśrīḥ* ⌊so the Poona ed., p. "114-13," top⌋ in KBU.; the Pet.  
Lexx. conjecture 'cushion' (*Polster*) for *apaśrayá*, but one does not  
see how the word should get any such sense; Aufrecht conjectures  
'coverlet,' as does M. Müller ⌊SBE. i. 278⌋ for *upaśrī:* but the latter  
should be something that leans against or is leaned against.

The Saman was the Cushion, and chanting the bolster.
