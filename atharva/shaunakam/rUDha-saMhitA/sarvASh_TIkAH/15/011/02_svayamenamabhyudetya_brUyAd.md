### Translation
2. Himself coming up toward him, he should say: *Vrātya*, where hast  
thou abode (*vas*)? *Vrātya*, \[here is\] water; *Vrātya*, let them  
gratify \[thee\]; *Vrātya*, be it so as is dear to thee; *Vrātya*, be it  
so as is thy will (*váśa*); *Vrātya*, be it so as is thy desire  
(*nikāmá*).

Rise up of his own accord to meet him, and say, Vratya, where didst thou pass the night? Vratya, here is water, Let them refresh thee. Vratya, let it be as thou pleasest. Vratya, as thy wish is so let it be. Vratya, as thy desire is so be it.
