### Translation
9. Unto him cometh \[his\] will, a will-possessor of will-possessors  
becometh he who knoweth thus.

### Notes
Most of the mss. (except D.R.s.m.) again accent *vaśás;* ⌊and so twelve  
of SPP's, but not his *śrotiyas*⌋; O. has *vaśī́nām*. Read at the  
beginning in our text *āí ’nam* (an accent-sign slipped out of place).

Authority comes to him who possesses this knowledge, and he becomes the controller of the powerful.
