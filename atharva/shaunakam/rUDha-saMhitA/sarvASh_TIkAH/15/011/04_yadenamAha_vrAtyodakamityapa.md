### Translation
4. In that he says to him: *Vrātya*, \[here is\] water, he thereby  
gains possession of the waters.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
R. is the only ms. that writes out at the beginning of this verse and  
the next yád enam ā́ha. It seems a blunder of the Anukr. to include this  
verse with 3, 5, 6, 8, 10 in one definition, as it is shorter than they  
by some six syllables; one of the mss. does in fact omit it here, but  
gives no definition of it elsewhere. ⌊At AB. viii. 24 is a passage  
bearing some similarity to this.⌋

When he says to him, Here is water, he secures thereby water for himself.
