### Translation
8. With the blue he envelops (*pra-vṛ*) a hostile cousin, with the red  
he pierces one hating him \[—he who knows thus\]: so say the theologians  
(*brahmavādín*) .

### Notes
If we read *-ti íti*, the syllables are 32; but to call the passage an  
*anuṣṭubh* is absurd. It can hardly be questioned that the addition in  
brackets is called for by the sense.

With dark-blue he envelops a detested rival, with red he pierces the man who hates him: so the theologians say.
