### Translation
1. ⌊1.⌋ As he moved out toward the eastern quarter, the troop  
(*śárdhas*) of Maruts, coming into being (*bhūtvā́*), moved out after,  
making mind \[their\] food-eater; ⌊2.⌋ with mind as food-eater doth he  
eat food who knoweth thus.

### Notes
Aufrecht understands the meaning to be as just given, and takes it  
correspondingly in the verses below. But it would be admissible also to  
render thus: 'when he moved out toward the eastern quarter, he moved out  
toward \[it\] after becoming the troop of Maruts'—and correspondingly in  
all the other verses. It is possible, by due resolution, to read the  
first subdivision as 32 syllables and the second as 15—and so in general  
in the other verses; no remark will be made upon them unless the cases  
are especially difficult.
