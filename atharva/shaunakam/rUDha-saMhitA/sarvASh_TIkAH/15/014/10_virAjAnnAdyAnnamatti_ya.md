### Translation
10. ⌊19.⌋ As he moved out toward the gods, Īśāna ('the lord'), coming  
into being, moved out after, making fury \[his\] food-eater; ⌊20.⌋ with  
fury as food-eater doth he eat food who knoweth thus.

### Notes
If nāgī gayatrī means 9 + 9 + 6 (Colebrooke, *Miscellaneous Essays*, ii.  
136, as cited by BR.), the first subdivision here comes so near it as to  
be capable of being read as 9 + 9 + 7 (being *bhurij*).

He, when he went away to the Gods, went away having become Isana and having made Passion an eater of food. He who hath this knowledge eats food with Passion as food-eater.
