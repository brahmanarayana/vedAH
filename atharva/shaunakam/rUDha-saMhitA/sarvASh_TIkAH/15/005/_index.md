### Comment
In this hymn, again, the division made by the mss. and the Anukr. is very strange and obviously opposed to the sense. Sixteen subdivisions ⌊the reckoning is explained above at p. 772, ¶ 3⌋ are made by reckoning the last 16 syllables ⌊following ī́śānaḥ and⌋ (beginning with nā́ ’sya) as belonging only to verses 1 and 7; and the mss. set no avasāna-mark after tiṣṭhati, where alone it has reason, but, in vss. 1, 7, introduce it after ī́śānaḥ, in the middle of a sentence. Rather than put it in so out of place, we have omitted it in our text. One ms. (R.), it may be noticed, fills out to tiṣṭhati॰: nā́ ’sya paśū́n ná sa-॰, showing that it understands vss. 2-6 to be carried out in full, like 1 and 7; the other mss. stop at diśáḥ, ⌊but at anuṣṭhātā́ in vs. 6⌋.
