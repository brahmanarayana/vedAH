### Translation
8. The gods go about the same purpose (*ártha*); thus (*etát*) verily  
the seasons go about after the year and the Vrātya.

### Notes
One ms. (R.) prefixes *tásya vrā́tyasya* also to this and the two  
following verses. ⌊In the Bombay ed., each verse begins with *tásya  
vrā́tyasya* and an *avasāna*-mark: see p. 771, end.⌋ The sense of the  
three is obscure; Aufrecht leaves them untranslated.

With one and the same object the Gods go round the Year and the Seasons follow round the Vratya.
