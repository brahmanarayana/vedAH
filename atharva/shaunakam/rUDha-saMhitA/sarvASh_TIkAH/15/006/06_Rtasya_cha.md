### Translation
6. ⌊16.⌋ He moved out toward an unindicated quarter; ⌊17.⌋ after him  
moved out both the seasons and they of the seasons and the worlds and  
they of the worlds and the months and the half-months and day-and-night.  
⌊18.⌋ Verily both of the seasons and of them of the seasons and of the  
worlds and of them of the worlds and of the months and of the  
half-months and of day-and-night doth he become the dear abode who  
knoweth thus.

### Notes
Most of the mss. accent *lóka* in both **b** and **c** (R.s.m.K.D. have  
*lokā́s;* only R.s.m. has *lokā́nām*); our text makes the needed  
correction. ⌊With the almost unanimous support of his authorities, SPP.  
prints *lókās, lókānām*, which accentuation (albeit so isolated) he  
takes in this case to be "the genuine Atharvan accent": see his notes,  
p. 330 f.⌋
