### Translation
7. ⌊19.⌋ He moved out toward an unreturned quarter; from it he thought  
not that he should return; ⌊20.⌋ after him moved out both Diti and Aditi  
and Iḍā and Indrāṇī. ⌊21.⌋ Verily both of Diti and of Aditi and of Iḍā  
and of Indrāṇī doth he become the dear abode who knoweth thus.

### Notes
*Ánāvṛtta* in **a** is obscure: the Pet. Lexx. render 'untrodden,' and  
Aufrecht, 'unvisited'; but both against the analogy of *nā́ ”vartsyán*  
(also of *ánāvṛt* and *anāvartin;* perhaps the true reading is  
*anāvṛtyā́m* ' not to be returned from.' Bp. reads *avartsyán*, the other  
*pada*-mss. *ā॰vartsyán*. I. accents *indrāṇyā̀ś*.
