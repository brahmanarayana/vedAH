### Translation
8. ⌊22.⌋ He moved out toward the quarters;

### Notes
There seems to be no good reason why this verse should not be divided,  
like all the rest, into three parts; but the Anukr. does not so  
prescribe, nor do the mss. set an *avasāna*-mark after the first *vy  
àcalat:* ⌊compare above, p. 772, ¶ 2⌋. The mss. all agree in accenting  
the second *ánu*.
