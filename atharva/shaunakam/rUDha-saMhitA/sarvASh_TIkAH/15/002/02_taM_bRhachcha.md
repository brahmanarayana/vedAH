### Translation
2. **a.** ⌊9.⌋ He arose; he moved out toward the southern quarter;  
**b.** ⌊10.⌋ after him moved out both the *yajñāyajñíya* and the  
*vāmadevyá* and the sacrifice and the sacrificer and the cattle; **c.**  
⌊11.⌋ against both the *yajñāyajñíya* and the *vāmadevyá* and the  
sacrifice and the sacrificer and the cattle doth he offend who revileth  
a thus-knowing Vrātya; **d.** ⌊12.⌋ of both the *yajñāyajñíya* and the  
*vāmadevyá* and the sacrifice and the sacrificer and the cattle doth he  
become the dear abode \[who knoweth thus\]. Of him in the southern  
quarter **e.** ⌊13.⌋ dawn is the harlot, the *mántra* the *māgadhá*,  
discernment the garment, day the turban, night the hair, yellow the two  
*pravartás*, *kalmalí* the jewel, **f.** ⌊14.⌋ both new moon and full  
moon the two footmen, mind the etc. etc.

### Notes
All the mss. have in **e** *mántro;* ⌊so also SPP.: correct the Berlin  
ed.⌋; in our text it and the *mitró* of 1 **e** have been made to change  
places, for the sake of better adaptation to the surroundings. Why 2  
**d** (44 syllables) should be called by the Anukr. an *ārṣī  
parānuṣṭubh* is obscure; perhaps *triṣṭubh* is to be added (or implied  
from the next preceding definition). ⌊For *paśavas*, perhaps 'victims'  
would suit the connection better than 'cattle,' here and below.⌋

He arose and went away to the southern region. Yajnayajniya and Vamadevya and Sacrifice and Sacrificer and sacrificial victims followed him. The man who reviles the Vratya possessing this knowledge is alienated from Yajnayajniya and Vamadevya, Sacrifice, Sacrificer and sacrificial victims. He who hath this knowledge becomes the beloved home of Yajnayajniya,Vamadevya, Sacrifice, Sacrificer, and sacrificial victims. In the southern region Dawn is his leman, Mitra his panegyrist, knowledge his vesture, day his turban, night his hair, Indra's two Bays are his circular ornaments, New Moon Night and Full Moon Night are his running attendants, Mind, etc. as in stanza 1.
