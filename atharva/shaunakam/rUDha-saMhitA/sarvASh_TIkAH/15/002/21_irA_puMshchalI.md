**e.** ⌊19.⌋  
cheer is the harlot, laughter the *māgadhá*, discernment the garment,  
day the turban, night the hair, yellow the two *pravartás*, *kalmalí*  
the jewel, 

### Notes
All our earlier mss. accent *irā́* in **e**, and our edition followed  
them, but some of the later ones (O.D.R.s.m.K.) have correctly *írā*,  
and the text should be emended accordingly. ⌊SPP., p. 322, maintains  
that the mss. showing *írā* are influenced by the RV. accentuation of  
the word, and holds that *irā́* is the true AV. reading.⌋ Some mss.  
(Bs.R.s.m.D.) accent *hasás*.
