### Translation
4. **a.** ⌊21.⌋ He arose; he moved out toward the northern quarter;  
**b.** ⌊22.⌋ after him moved out both the *śyāitá* and the *nāudhasá*  
and the seven seers and king Soma; **c.** ⌊23.⌋ against both the  
*śyāitá* and the *nāudhasá* and the seven seers and king Soma doth he  
offend who revileth a thus-knowing Vrātya; **d.** ⌊24.⌋ of both the  
*śyāitá* and the *nāudhasá* and the seven seers and king Soma doth he  
become the dear abode \[who knoweth thus\]. Of him in the northern  
quarter **e.** ⌊25.⌋ lightning is the harlot, thunder the *māgadhá*,  
discernment the garment, day the turban, night the hair, yellow the two  
*pravartás*, *kalmalí* the jewel, f. ⌊26.⌋ both what is heard and what  
is heard abroad the two footmen, mind the ⌊rough vehicle, **g.** 27.  
Mātariśvan and Pavamāna the two drawers of the rough vehicle, the wind  
the charioteer, the whirlwind the goad, **h.** 28. both fame and glory  
the two forerunners: to him cometh fame, cometh glory, who knoweth  
thus.⌋

### Notes
The majority of our mss. read *śāitá* in **b, c, d;** *śyāitá* is given  
by I.O.D.R.K. In **b**, I.O.K. have *saptaṛṣ-*; in **c, d** they agree  
with the rest in *saptarṣ-*. ⌊The *śyāita* and *nāudhasa* mentioned  
together at KBU. i. 5.⌋
