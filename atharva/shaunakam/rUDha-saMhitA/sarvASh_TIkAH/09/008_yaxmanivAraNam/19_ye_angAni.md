### Translation
19. They that intoxicate (*maday-*) the limbs, the *yákṣmas*, thy  
gripers—the poison of all *yákṣmas* have I exorcised from thee.

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **b** *ropaṇā saha*. Some of our mss. (P.M.O.p.m.) read  
*yé ’n̄gāni*.

Consumptions with their Colic pains which make thy limbs insensible I have evoked the poison-taint of all Consumptions out of thee.
