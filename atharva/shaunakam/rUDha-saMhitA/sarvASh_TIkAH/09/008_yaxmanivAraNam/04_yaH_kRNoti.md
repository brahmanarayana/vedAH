### Translation
4. Whatever one makes a man dumb (? *pramóta*), makes \[him\]  
blind—every head-disease etc. etc.

### Notes
'Dumb' for pramóta is Zimmer's conjecture; the word is wholly obscure,  
and form, accent, and meter make it suspicious; one is tempted to  
conjecture *prámohitam;* but *muh* with prefix *pra* is not a Vedic  
combination. The Anukr. takes no notice of the defective pāda.

The malady that makes one deaf, the malady that makes one blind, All malady that wrings thy brow we charm away with this our spell.
