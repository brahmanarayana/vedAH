### Translation
12. Out of thy belly, lung, navel, heart, the poison of all etc. etc.

### Notes
Ppp. rectifies the meter of **a** by inserting *pari* before *klomnas*,  
and makes **c, d** agree with our 9 **c, d**. The Anukr. brings out an  
*uṣṇih* (28 syll.) by unnaturally refusing to make the resolutions  
*nābhi-ās* and *tu-at* ⌊and scanning as 6 + 7: 8 + 7⌋.
