### Translation
21. Forth from thy feet, knees, hips, buttock, spine, nape the pangs,  
from thy head the disease have I made disappear.

### Notes
Ppp. reads, after *te, gulphābhyāṁ jan̄ghābhyāṁ jānubhyām ūrubhyāṁ śro.  
p. bh.;* it reads *ānūkyāt* in **c**, and inserts before *śīrṣṇas,  
grīvābhyas skandhebhyas*. It is apparently the intrusion of *arṣaṇī́s*  
that spoils the meter in our **c**.

I have dispelled the piercing pains from feet, knees, hips, and hinder parts, And spine, and from the neck and nape the malady that racked the head.
