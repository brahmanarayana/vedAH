### Translation
13. They that break apart the crown, rushers against the head  
(*mūrdhán*)—not injuring, free from disease, let them run out, out at  
the orifice.

### Notes
The 'they' in this and the following verses (13-18) is fem. The Pet.  
Lexx. take *arṣaṇī́* in **b** as an independent noun (it is found only  
here), and conjecture it to mean 'pricking pains.'

The penetrating stabs of pain which rend asunder crown and head, Let them depart and pass away, free from disease and harming not.
