### Translation
17. They that creep along the intestines, and confound the entrails—not  
injuring etc. etc.

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **b** *yāpayanti* for *mohayanti*. ⌊Roth most ingeniously  
suggests that the Ppp. reading may mean *āntrā, ni-y-āmayanti*. Or is  
*yāpayanti* to be taken in a sense quite like our English 'cause (the  
bowels) to move,' i.e. 'produce diarrhœa'?⌋

The pains that through the bowels creep, disordering the inward parts, Let them depart and pass away, free from disease and harming not.
