### Translation
22. Together the bones (*kapā́la*) of thy head, and the discusser  
(*vidhú*) of thy heart—arising, O Āditya, thou with thy rays hast made  
disappear the disease of the head, hast pacified the limb-splitter.

### Notes
The first two pādas seem independent; an unfinished construction. The  
*pada*-text reads *vi॰dhúḥ* in **b**, as if it recognized in the word  
the root *dhū* + *vi;* this is not implausible, and the translation  
follows it (the simple "beat" of the Pet. Lexx. seems quite  
unacceptable; it might be 'palpitation'). But Ppp. reads instead  
*vidus*, and so do a part of our mss., namely, W.O.s.m.D.Kp. ⌊W.  
interlines a query over "discusser," which word he coins and uses in the  
sense 'shaker asunder.' "Discuss" in this sense is "obsolete except in  
surgical use."⌋ Ppp. further has, for our **c** etc.: *udyat sūryādityo  
an̄gāni roma nakhāni sarvāṇi sadanāni nīnaśat*.  
  
⌊The fourth *anuvāka*, with 2 hymns and 48 verses, ends here. The quoted  
Anukr. says *navadaśā ’pare ca*.⌋

Sound are the skull-bones of thy head and thy heart's beat is regular. Thou, Sun, arising with thy beams hast chased away the head's disease, hast stilled the pain that racked the limbs.
