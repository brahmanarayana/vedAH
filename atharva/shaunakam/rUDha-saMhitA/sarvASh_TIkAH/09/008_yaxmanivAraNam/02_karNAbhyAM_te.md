### Translation
2. From thy (two) ears, from thy *kán̄kūṣas*, the earache, the  
*visálpaka*, every head-disease etc. etc.

### Notes
As to *visalpakam*, instead of the *visalyakam* of the edition, see  
under vi. 127. 1. For the obscure *kan̄kūṣa* Ppp. has *kaṅkukha*, and for  
**b** it reads *śuktivalśaṁ vilohitam*.
