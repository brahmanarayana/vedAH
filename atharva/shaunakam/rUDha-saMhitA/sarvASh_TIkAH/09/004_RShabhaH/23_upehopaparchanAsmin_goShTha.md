### Translation
23. Here in this stall, O closeness (*upapárcana*), be thou close unto  
us; unto \[us\] what seed the bull has; unto \[us\], O Indra, thy  
heroism.

### Notes
This is a variant of RV. vi. 28. 8 (with which TB. ii. 8. 8¹² and LśS.  
iii. 3. 4 precisely agree); RV. has, for **a, b**, *úpe ’dám upapárcanam  
āsú góṣū́ ’pa pṛcyatām*, with *rétasi* for *yád rétas* in **c**, and  
*vīryè* at the end: a very different sense; the Pet. Lexx. understand  
*upa-pṛc* as signifying here sexual union. We have to combine  
irregularly *goṣṭho ’pa* in order to rectify the meter of **b**; the  
Anukr. does not heed the irregularity.

Here we restore this Bull, your youthful leader: sporting with him, go, wander at your pleasure. Ne'er, wealthy ones! may he be reft of offspring; and do ye favour us with growth of riches.
