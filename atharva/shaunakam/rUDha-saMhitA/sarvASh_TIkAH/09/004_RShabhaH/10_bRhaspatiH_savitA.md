### Translation
10. Brihaspati, Savitar bestowed on thee vigor (*váyas*); from Tvashṭar,  
from Vāyu was brought forth thy soul (*ātmán*); with mind in the  
atmosphere I make offering (*hu*) of thee; let heaven-and-earth both be  
thy *barhís*.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *manas* for *vayas* in **a**. The Anukr. calls the verse  
*jagatī*, though two of its pādas are *triṣṭubh*.

Brihaspati, Savitar gave thee vital vigour: thy breath was brought from Tvashtar and from Vayu. In thought I offer thee in air's mid-region. Thy sacrificial grass be Earth and Heaven!
