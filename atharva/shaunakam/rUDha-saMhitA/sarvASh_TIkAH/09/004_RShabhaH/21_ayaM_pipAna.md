### Translation
21. Let this burly (*pípāna*) one, a very Indra, bestow conspicuous  
wealth; let this one \[bestow\] a well-milking cow, constantly with  
calf; let him yield (*duh*) inspired will beyond the sky.

### Notes
Ppp. has very different readings, which in part are less unacceptable  
than those of our text: for **a, b**, *ayaṁ pipānā indriyaṁ gayāṁ  
bibharti tejanī:* in **d**, *vipaśyataṁ puro divaḥ*. ⌊For *pípāna*, cf.  
Bloomfield, AJP. xii. 443.⌋

Indra here verily hath rejoiced: let him bestow conspicuous wealth. May he draw forth at will from yonder side of heaven a deft cow, good to milk, whose calf is never wanting.
