### Translation
8. Indra's force, Varuṇa's two arms, the Aśvins' two shoulders, of the  
Maruts this hump; they who are wise, poets, who are skilful (*manīṣín*),  
call him Brihaspati brought together.

### Notes
The verse has two *jagatī*-pādas, though called by the Anukr. simply  
*bhurij*. Read at the end of **b** *kakút*.
