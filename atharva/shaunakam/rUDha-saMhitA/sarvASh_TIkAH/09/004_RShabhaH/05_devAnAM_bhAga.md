### Translation
5. The gods' portion \[was\] that load, the sap of waters, of plants,  
of ghee; the mighty one (*śakrá*) chose a drink of soma; a great stone  
became what \[was his\] body.

### Notes
This verse also is found in TS. and MS. (as above), in both texts  
preceding our vs. 4 (in MS. one other verse intervenes, our xviii. 4.  
28). Both have, for **a**, *devā́nām eṣá upanāhá āsīt;* for **b**, TS.  
has *apā́ṁ gárbha óṣahīṣu nyàktaḥ*, and MS. *apā́m pátir vṛṣabhá  
óṣadhīnām;* in **c**, both have *drapsám* for *bhakṣám* and *pūṣā́* for  
*śakráḥ;* in **d**, after *abhavat*, MS. has *yát tád ā́sīt*, and TS.  
*tád eṣām*.

He is the Gods' allotted share and bundle, essence of waters, and of plants, and butter. Sakra elected him, the draught of Soma. What was his body was a lofty mountain.
