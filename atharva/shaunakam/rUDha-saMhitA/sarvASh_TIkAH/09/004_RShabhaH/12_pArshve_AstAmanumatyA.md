### Translation
12. His sides were Anumati's; his flanks (? *anūvṛ́j*) were Bhaga's; of  
his knees (*aṣṭhīvánt*) Mitra said: those are wholly mine.

### Notes
All the nouns are duals. The Anukr. takes no notice of the redundant  
syllable in **c**. ⌊Henry would emend thus: -*vántābrav*-, i.e. -*vántā  
abrav*-. Ppp. reads at the beginning *pārśvay āstām*.

The sides must be Anumati's, and both rib-pieces Bhaga's share, Of the knee-bones hath Mitra said, Both these are mine, and only mine.
