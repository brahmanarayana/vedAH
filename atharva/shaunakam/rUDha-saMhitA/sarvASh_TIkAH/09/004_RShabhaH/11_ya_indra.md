### Translation
11. He who goes speaking out greatly among the kine, like Indra among  
the gods—of that bull let the worshiper (*brahmán*) praise together the  
members excellently.

### Notes
All our mss. (save O.) read, like the edition, *tásya ṛṣa-* in **c**,  
although the passage is quoted as example under the Prāt. rule (iii. 46)  
that *a* or *ā* + *ṛ* make *ar*. Ppp. reads in **a** *āindrī ’va*. The  
*paddhati* (note to Kāuś. 24. 19) has the verse whispered in the right  
ear of the released bull.

Let the priest joyfully extol the limbs and members of the Bull Who moved and roared among the kine as Indra moves among the Gods.
