### Translation
17. With his horns he pushes the demon; with his eye he slays ruin; with  
his ears he hears what is excellent—he who is the inviolable lord of  
kine.

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **a, b** *rakṣa riṣad rātī*. The Prāt. (ii. 70) notes that  
the reading in **d** is not *yás pát-*. Some of the mss. (Bp.I.K.)  
accent *aghnyàs*.
