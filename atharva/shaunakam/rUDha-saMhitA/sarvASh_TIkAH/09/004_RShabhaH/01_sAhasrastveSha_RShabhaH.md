### Translation
1. The bright bull of a thousand, rich in milk, bearing all forms in his  
bellies, desiring to accomplish (? *śikṣ*) what is excellent for his  
giver, the sacrificer—he, the ruddy one of Brihaspati, hath stretched  
⌊*ā-tan*⌋ the line (*tántu*).

### Notes
That is, doubtless, 'has extended or performed the sacrifice.'
