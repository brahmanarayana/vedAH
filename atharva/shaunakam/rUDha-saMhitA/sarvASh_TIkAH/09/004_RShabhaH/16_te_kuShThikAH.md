### Translation
16. Those dew-claws (*kúṣṭhikā*) \[were\] Saramā's; they assigned the  
hoofs to the tortoises (*kūrmá*); the content of his bowels they  
maintained for the worms, the *śavartás*.

### Notes
The mss. are divided between *śavarta* (P.s.m.I.O.R.p.m.T.D.Kp.) and  
*śvavarta* (Bp.E.R.s.m.); while M. and P.p.m. have *śvaśavarta*, and W.  
*śaśavarta*. The occurrence of *śavartá* in TS. (v. 7. 23¹: also in  
connection with *ū́badhya*) determined the reading of our text. But our  
*pada*-text divides the word (Bp. *śva॰vartá;* D.Kp. *śa॰v-*), which  
favors the reading *śva-*, since it implies a combination of the two  
recognizably independent words *śvan* and *varta*, 'occurring in dogs,'  
or something of the sort. Ppp. apparently has *śivaratrebhyo*. ⌊Roth  
suggests that *śavarta* may be for *śavavarta* 'Aaswurm, Made.'⌋

They gave the hooves to tortoises, to Sarama scraps of the feet: His undigested food they gave to worms and things that creep and crawl.
