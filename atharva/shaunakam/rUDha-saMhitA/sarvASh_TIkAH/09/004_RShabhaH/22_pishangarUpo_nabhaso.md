### Translation
22. Of reddish form, clouded (? *nabhasá*), vigor-giving, vehemence of  
Indra, all-formed, he hath come to us, assigning to us life-time and  
progeny; and with abundances of wealth let him attach himself to  
(*abhi-sac*) us.

### Notes
The last half-verse agrees nearly with xviii. 4. 62 **c, d**, where  
*dádhatas* and *sacadhvam* make better meter. It is not impossible to  
resolve *asmábhi-am* in **c**, but *sacantām*, which some of the mss.  
read (P.p.m.W.D.), is forbidden by the sense. Ppp. has a wholly  
different line: *prajām asmabhyaṁ dadhato rayiṁ ca dīrghāyutvāya  
śataśāradāya*. ⌊Bloomfield translates the verse at ZDMG. xlviii. 566,  
but overlooks the accent of *nabhasó:* cf. *támas-ā* and *tamasā́*  
(*saṁhitā*-form at xi. 9. 22).⌋
