### Translation
4. Father of calves, lord of the inviolable \[kine\], also father of  
great gulfs (*gárgara*); calf, afterbirth, fresh milk, beestings, curd,  
ghee—that \[is\] his seed.

### Notes
The verse occurs also in TS. (iii. 3. 9²), MS. (ii. 5. 10), and K.  
(xiii. 9). In **b**, MS. reads *utā́ ’yám* for *átho;* for **d**, TS. has  
*āmíkṣā mástu ghṛtám asya rétaḥ*, and MS. the same, save *yóniḥ* for  
*rétaḥ*.

The husband of the cows, the young calves' father, father is he of mighty water-eddies. Calf, after-birth, new milk drawn hot, and biestings, curds, butter, that is his best genial humour.
