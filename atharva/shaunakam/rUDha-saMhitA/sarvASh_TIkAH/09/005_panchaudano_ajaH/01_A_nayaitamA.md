### Translation
1. Conduct him hither; take hold; let him go, foreknowing, unto the  
world of the well-doing; crossing the great darknesses variously, let  
the goat step unto the third firmament (*nā́ka*).

### Notes
Ppp. has, in **c**, *vipaśyaṁ* for *mahānti:* cf. our 3 **c**. The first  
six verses of the hymn are quoted in their order in Kāuś. 64. 6-16 (vs.  
1 also in 64. 27) in connection with the bringing in, slaughtering, and  
cooking of a goat; vss. 1 and 2 also in Vāit. 10. 14, 15, in connection  
with the sacrifice of an animal. This verse is called by the Anukr.  
simply a *triṣṭubh*, although its first half is very irregular (8 + 13).
