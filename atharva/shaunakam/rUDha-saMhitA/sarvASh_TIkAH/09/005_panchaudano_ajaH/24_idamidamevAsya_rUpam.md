### Translation
24. This and this verily becomes its form; therewith one makes it come  
together; food, greatness, refreshment it yields (*duh*) to him who  
gives a goat with five rice-dishes, with the light of sacrificial gifts.

### Notes
Ppp. reads for the second half-verse *svadhām ūrjam akṣatiṁ maho ‘smai  
duhe: ya evaṁ viduṣo ‘jaṁ pañcāudanaṁ dadāti;* and, as above noted, our  
vs. 2 then follows. The metrical description of the Anukr. (closely  
accordant with that of vs. 26, though the real construction of the  
verses is very different) implies the artificial division of the refrain  
(as in vs. 28 and other verses below) into two pādas, of 7 and 9  
syllables, and counts 46 syllables in all; the natural number is 45 (12  
+ 8: 10 + 15 = 45).

This, even this is his true form: the man uniteth him therewith. Food, greatness, strength he bringeth him who giveth the Goat Panchaudana illumed with guerdon.
