### Translation
17. Wherewith thou carriest a thousand; wherewith, O Agni, \[the  
offering of\] one's whole possession—therewith carry thou this our  
offering to go to heaven (*svàr*) among the gods.

### Notes
The verse is found also in VS. (xv. 55), TS. (iv. 7. 13⁴; v. 7. 7³), MS.  
(ii. 12. 4), and K. (xl. 12 ⌊but Schroeder under the MS. passage refers  
to K. xviii. 18⌋). VS. and MS. put *sahásram* after *váhasi* in **a**,  
and VS. reads ⌊*yéna* in **a**, and⌋ *naya* for *vaha* in **c**; TS.  
has in iv. for **d** *devayā́no yá uttamáḥ* (in v. it agrees throughout  
with our text). Ppp. begins with *yéna vā sah-*. Vāit. quotes the verse  
in 29. 9, 23. ⌊MS. has *yéna*.⌋
