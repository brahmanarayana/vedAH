### Translation
31. Whoever knows the season "torrid" (*nāídāgha*) by name—that verily  
is the season "torrid" by name, namely (*yát*) the goat with five  
rice-dishes; he indeed burns out the fortune of his unfriendly foe  
(*bhrā́tṛvya*), he thrives (*bhū*) by himself, who gives a goat with five  
rice-dishes, with the light of sacrificial gifts.

### Notes
In this and the following verses the mss. read *nā́ma rtúm* etc.  
throughout. The natural division is into four pādas instead of seven,  
and ⌊the paragraph, read as prose, has⌋ only 61 syllables instead of 64  
(= *aṣṭi*); but the three missing syllables can easily be made out by  
resolutions. One would expect *ní dahati*, to correspond with  
*nāídāgha*. Read in **b** *yád ajáḥ* (an accent-sign slipped out of  
place).
