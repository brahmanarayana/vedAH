### Translation
2. I lead thee about as portion for Indra, as patron (*sūrí*) for the  
sacrificer at this sacrifice; whoever hate us, them take hold after;  
innocent (*ánāgas*) \[are\] the sacrificer's heroes.

### Notes
The verse in Ppp. (as noted above) follows what corresponds to our vs.  
24, and has, for **a, b**, *ind. bh. śamitā kṛṇotvaṁ yajña yajñapatiś ca  
sūriḥ;* and, for **d**, *ariṣṭā vīrā yajamānāś ca sarve*.

I bring thee hither as a share for Indra; prince, at this sacrifice,. for him who worships. Grasp firmly from behind all those who hate us: so let the sacri- ficer's men be sinless.
