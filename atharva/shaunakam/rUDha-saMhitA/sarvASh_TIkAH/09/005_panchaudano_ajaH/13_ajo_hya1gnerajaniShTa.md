### Translation
13. The goat verily was born from the heat of the fire, wise, of the  
wise (*vípra*), of power, he the inspired one; what is offered, is  
bestowed, is conferred (*abhípūrta*), accompanied with *váṣaṭ*—that let  
the gods prepare in due season (*rtuśás*).

### Notes
The first pāda is identical with iv. 14. 1 **a**. Ludwig (also p. 370)  
proposes to emend in **c** to *gūrtam abhigūrtam*. Part of the mss.  
blunderingly accent *ṛtuśàs* in **d**. Ppp. has in b vayodha instead of  
vipaqcit, and in c puts purtam before istam. The last two padas are  
irregular, but the Anukr. takes no notice of it. ⌊Pāda **c** is a good  
*jagatī;* and **d**, a good *triṣṭubh*, if we read *devā́sas*, or (with  
Henry) *tád íd*.⌋
