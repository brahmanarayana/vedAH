### Translation
8. Having five rice-dishes, let him step out five-fold, about to step  
unto the three lights; go thou forth to the midst of the well-doing that  
have made offerings; spread out (*vi-śri*) upon the third firmament.

### Notes
The last pāda is the same with xviii. 4. 3 **e**; Ppp. has instead  
*jyotiṣmantam abhi lokaṁ jayā ’smāi*, with which compare our 6 **d**.  
The Anukr. passes in silence the irregularities of the second pāda. ⌊Cf.  
Oldenberg, ZDMG. l. 449.⌋

Let the Panchaudana Goat, about to visit the three lights, pass away in five divisions. Go midst the pious who have paid their worship, and parted, dwell on the third cope of heaven.
