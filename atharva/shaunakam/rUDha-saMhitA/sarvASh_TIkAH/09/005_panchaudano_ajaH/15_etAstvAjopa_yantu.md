### Translation
15. Unto thee, O goat, let these streams of soma (*somyá*) go, divine,  
ghee-backed, honey-dripping; establish thou earth and sky, upon the  
seven-rayed back of the firmament.

### Notes
The mss. in general (not P.M.) accent *ája* in **a**. They are rather  
evenly divided between *ádhi* and *‘dhi* in **d** (W.I.O.R.T.K. have  
*‘dhi*). Compare with **a, b** the refrain to iv. 34. 5-7. Ppp. reads  
for **a**: *etās tvā dadhārā ’cchamayanti viśvatās somyaṁ;* ⌊*somyaṁ*  
would seem to be the beginning of Ppp's **b**;⌋ in **c, d**, for  
*uta...pṛṣṭhe*, it gives *divaṁ sadasva nāke tiṣṭhāsy*. Pādas **b, c**  
are metrically irregular, but the Anukr. does not heed it.

Near to thee, Goat! approach these streams of Soma, divine, distilling meath, bedecked with butter! Stay thou the earth and sky and fix them firmly up on the seven- rayed pitch and height of heaven.
