### Translation
37. Cook ye the goat and the five rice-dishes; let all the quarters,  
like-minded, united (*sadhryàñc*), with the intermediate directions,  
accept that of thee.

### Notes
All the mss. (except D.) read at the end *tá* (*pada*-text *té*) before  
*etám;* our edition emends to *ta;* the word could better be spared  
altogether. Ppp. has (in iii.) only the first pāda. The Anukr. describes  
the verse as if this pāda as well as the other two were metrical.
