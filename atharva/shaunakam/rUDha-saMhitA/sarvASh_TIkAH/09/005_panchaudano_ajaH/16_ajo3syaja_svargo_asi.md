### Translation
16. A goat art thou; O goat, heaven-going (*svar-gá*) art thou; by thee  
the An̄girases foreknew \[their\] world; that pure (*púṇya*) world would  
I fain foreknow.

### Notes
⌊Prose.⌋ The translation of **a** is according to the accent of the  
vocative *ája;* there may be a play on words between *ajá* 'goat' and  
*ajá* 'unborn': 'unborn art thou, O goat' (emending to *aja*). Ppp.  
reads for **c** *taṁ lokaṁ anu pra jñeṣma*. ⌊This vs. and the next are  
in its iii.⌋ The definition of the meter by the Anukr. seems senseless  
(7 \[8?\] + 11: 8 = 26). The third pāda is VS. xx. 25 **c**.

Unborn art thou, O Goat: to heaven thou goest. Though thee Angirases knew that radiant region. So may I know that holy world.
