### Translation
9. Ascend, O goat, to where is the world of the well-doing; like an  
expelled *śarabhá* mayest thou move (*eṣ*) across difficult places;  
given, with five rice-dishes, to a priest (*brahmán*), he shall rejoice  
the giver with rejoicing.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *kramasva* instead of *roha* in **a**, and reads *śalabhas*  
'locust,' which is more sensible, in **b**; our **d** is its 10 **d**,  
with *dhātāram* instead of *dā-*. The Anukr. treats the second pāda as  
regular, and it can, indeed, be read by violence into 11 syllables.

Rise to that world, O Goat, where dwell the righteous: pass, like a Sarabha veiled, all difficult places. The Goat Panchaudana, given to a Brahman, shall with all ful- ness satisfy the giver.
