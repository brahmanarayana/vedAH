### Translation
27. Whoever (fem.) having gained a former husband, then gains another  
later one—if (*ca*) they (dual) shall give a goat with five rice-dishes,  
they shall not be separated.

### Notes
The mss., as usual in such cases, read *vitvā́* in **a**; and all but Bp.  
strangely accent *anyàm* in **b**. Ppp. reads *pacatas* for *dadātas* in  
**d**. ⌊This vs. and the next are in Ppp's viii.⌋
