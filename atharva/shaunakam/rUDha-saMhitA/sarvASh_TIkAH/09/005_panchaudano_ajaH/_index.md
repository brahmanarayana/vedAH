### Comment
⌊Partly prose—"vss." 16, 20-22, 31-36; also considerable parts of 23-30.⌋ Found for the most part also in Pāipp., but not all together, nor even all in the same book; the greater part of the vss. (1, 3-6, 8, 7, 11, 9, 12, 10, 13-15, 19-21, 23, 24, 2) occur in xvi.; vss. 16, 17, 37 (part) in iii.; vss. 27, 28 in viii.; vss. 24-26, 31-36 are represented by similar, but briefer and very corrupt material, in xvi.; vss. 18, 22, 37 (part), 38 are wanting ⌊apparently also 29-30⌋. Three of the verses are quoted in Vāit., and more in Kāuś.: see under the verses.


### Translations
Translated: Muir, v. 304-6 (parts); Ludwig, p. 435; Henry, 93, 133; Griffith, i. 442.
