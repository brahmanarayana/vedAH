### Translation
28. Her later husband comes to have the same world with his remarried  
spouse who (masc.) gives a goat with five rice-dishes, with the light of  
sacrificial gifts.

### Notes
The Anukr. treats the prose refrain of vss. 22, 24-26 as a half  
*anuṣṭubh* in the second line of this verse. Ppp. reads instead *ajaṁ ca  
pañcāudanaṁ dadat*.
