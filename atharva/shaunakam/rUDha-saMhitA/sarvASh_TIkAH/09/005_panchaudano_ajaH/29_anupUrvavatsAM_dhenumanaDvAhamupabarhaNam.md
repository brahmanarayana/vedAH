### Translation
29. A milch-cow having one calf after another, a draft-ox, a pillow, a  
garment, gold, having given, those go to the highest heaven (*dív*).

### Notes
The Anukr. takes no notice of the redundant syllable in **b**. ⌊Perhaps  
it balances the redundancy of **b** with the deficiency of **c**.⌋
