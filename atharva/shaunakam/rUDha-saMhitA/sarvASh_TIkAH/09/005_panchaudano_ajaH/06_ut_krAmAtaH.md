### Translation
6. Step up from here, if thou hast been completely heated, from the  
heated pot on to the third firmament; thou, a fire, hast come into being  
out of fire; conquer \[thy way\] unto that world of light.

### Notes
The translation of **a** implies the emendation to *átapthās*, which  
seems very probable; nearly all the mss. read *ataptās* (only E. *áta-*,  
P.M. *ataptas*), which the edition has altered to *átaptas*. Of the  
reading in Ppp. I have no note; Ppp. reads for **d** *jyotiṣmo acha  
sukṛtāṁ yatra lokaḥ;* our **d** is found (nearly) as its 8 **d**.

Hence come thou forth, vexed by no pain or torment. Mount to the third heaven from the heated vessel. As fire out of the fire hast thou arisen. Conquer and win this lucid world of splendour.
