### Translation
38. Let them defend this of thine for thee; to them I offer (*hu*)  
sacrificial butter, this oblation.

### Notes
'Them' is fem., designating the 'quarters' of vs. 37. The translation  
omits a *te;* it may be regarded as an ethical dative, anticipating the  
distincter *túbhyam* 'for thee' that follows.  
  
⌊This hymn begins with *ā́ naya;* and, with its 38 vss., exceeds the norm  
by 18. The quoted Anukr. says *aṣṭādaśā “”naya.”*⌋  
  
⌊The twentieth *prapāṭhaka* ends here. As in the cases of the tenth and  
eighteenth (ending at v. 7 and viii. 5), the *prapāṭhaka*-division here  
fails to coincide with the *anuvāka*-division.⌋
