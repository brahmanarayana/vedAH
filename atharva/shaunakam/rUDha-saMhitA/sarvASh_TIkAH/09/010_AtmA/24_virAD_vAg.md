### Translation
24. *Virā́j* \[is\] speech, *virā́j* earth, *virā́j* atmosphere, *virā́j*  
Prajāpati; *virā́j* became death, the over-king of the perfectibles  
(*sādhyá*); in his control are what was, what is to be; let him put in  
my control what was, what is to be.

### Notes
⌊Prose.⌋ This verse, with all that follows it, is wanting in Ppp. The  
Anukr. reckons the whole first part to the pause as one pāda (20  
syllables, a *kṛti*-pāda); the *pada*-text understands it as two,  
dividing after *pṛthivī*.

Viraj is Speech, and Earth, and Air's mid-region. He is Praja- pati, and he is Mrityu. He is the Lord Imperial of the Sadhyas. He rules what is and what shall be hereafter. May he make me lord of what is and shall be.
