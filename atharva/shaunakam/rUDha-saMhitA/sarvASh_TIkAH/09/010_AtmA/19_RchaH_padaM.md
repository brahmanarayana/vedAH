### Translation
19. Shaping (*kalpay-*) with measure the step of the verse, they shaped  
by the half-verse all that stirs; the *bráhman* of three feet,  
many-formed, spread out (*vi-sthā*); by that do the four quarters live.

### Notes
The comm. to the Prāt. (ii. 93) quotes *ví taṣṭhe* at end of **c** as an  
example of the *s* of *sthā* lingualized after *ví* even though the  
reduplication intervenes; and that establishes *ví taṣṭhe* as the true  
reading. The majority of the *saṁhitā*-mss. have it; but W.E.O. give  
*caṣṭe;* Ppp. also has *parirūpaṁ vi caṣṭe*. Only the fourth pāda is  
found in RV., being i. 164. 42 **b** (we have 42 **a** as our 21 **e**);  
the same occurs below as xi. 5. 12 **d**.
