### Translation
8. Breathing lies the swift moving thing, living, stirring, fixed, in  
the midst of the abodes (*pastyā̀*); the living one moves at the will (?  
*svadhā́bhis*) of the dead one; the immortal one \[is\] of like source  
with the mortal.

### Notes
The verse is excessively obscure, and Hillebrandt's translation of the  
second half, and reference to the moon (*Ved. Mythol.*, pp. 336, 498),  
very forced and implausible. The verse lacks a syllable in **a** (and  
the *pada*-text sets its mark of pāda-division after *éjat;* perhaps we  
are to resolve *-ga-ātu*. Ppp. puts the verse after our vs. 9. ⌊RV., vs.  
30, shows no variant. Roth's most interesting interpretation (ZDMG.  
xlvi. 759) makes of the verse a riddle whose answer is "the body and the  
soul." He emends to *ánanac* in *a*. Böhtlingk, *Berichte der  
sächsischen Gesell.*, 1893, xlv. 88, reviews Roth's interpretation.⌋

That which hath breath and life and speed and motion lies firmly stablished in the midst of houses. The living moves by powers of the departed: the immortal is the brother of the mortal.
