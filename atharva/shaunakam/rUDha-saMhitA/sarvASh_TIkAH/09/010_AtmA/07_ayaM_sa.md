### Translation
7. This one here twangs, by whom the cow is surrounded; she lows a  
lowing, being set (*śritá*) on the sparkler (*dhvasáni*); since she put  
down mortals by her thoughts (*cittí*), becoming the lightning, she  
threw (*ūh*) back the wrap.

### Notes
Both RV. ⌊vs. 29⌋ and Ppp. read *mártyam* in **c**.

He also snorts, by whom encompassed round the Cow lows as she closely clings to him who sheds the rain. She with her shrilling cries hath humbled mortal men, and turn- ed to lightning, hath stripped off her covering robe.
