### Translation
23. She that is footless goes first of them (fem.) that have feet: who  
understood (*ā-cit*) that of you, O Mitra and Varuṇa? the embryo brings  
(*ā-bhṛ*) the burden of her; she (?) fills (? *pṛ*) truth, protects  
(*ni-pā*) untruth.

### Notes
The last pāda is especially obscure: he? or she? or it? and which root  
pṛ, 'fill' or 'pass'? The verse is RV. i. 152. 3, where we read *tārit*  
instead of *pāti* at the end, and *asya* for *asyās* at end of **c**.  
Ppp. also has *tārīt*, but, instead of *ā́ cid asyāḥ* (or *asya*), it  
reads *ād ṛtasya*.

The footless Maid precedeth footed creatures. Who marketh, Mitra Varuna! this your doing? The Babe unborn supporteth this world's burthen, supporteth Right and watcheth Wrong and Falsehood.
