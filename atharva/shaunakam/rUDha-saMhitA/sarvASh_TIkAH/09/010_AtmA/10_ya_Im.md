### Translation
10. He who made him knows not of him; \[he is\] verily out of sight now  
of him who saw him; he, enveloped within his mother's womb, with his  
much progeny, entered into perdition (*nírṛti*).

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The translation follows the RV. reading, *nírṛtim*, in **d**, since the  
nom. *-tis* seems unconstruable. Both RV. ⌊vs. 32⌋ and Ppp. put the  
verse after our vs. 11, and the latter reads *so ‘sya* in **a**. Haug  
interprets the lightning to be intended.

He who hath made him doth not comprehend him: from him who saw him surely he is hidden. He, yet enveloped in his mother's bosom, source of much life, hath sunk into destruction.
