### Translation
4. I invite that well-milking milch-cow; a skilful-handed milker also  
shall milk her; may the impeller impel us the best impulse; the hot  
drink is kindled about: that may he kindly proclaim.

### Notes
We had this verse above as vii. 73. 7. The only variant in RV. ⌊vs. 26⌋  
is the better *vocam* at the end. ⌊Oldenberg discusses verses 4-7, IFA.  
vi. 182.⌋
