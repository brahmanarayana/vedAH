### Translation
26. Three hairy ones look out seasonably; in the (a?) year one of them  
shears itself; another looks upon all with might (*śácībhis*); of one is  
seen the rush, not the form.

### Notes
The RV. version ⌊vs. 44⌋ has in **c** *víśam éko abhí caṣṭe;* our  
*abhicáṣṭe* is a regular case of antithetical accent. The RV.  
*pada*-text does not divide *saṁvatsare*. Haug interprets the verse of  
the three forms of Agni; Hillebrandt (*Ved. Mythol.*, i. p. 472), of the  
moon (!?), sun, and wind.

Three with long tresses show in ordered season. One of them sheareth when the year is ended. One with his powers the universe regardeth. Of one the sweep is seen, but not the figure.
