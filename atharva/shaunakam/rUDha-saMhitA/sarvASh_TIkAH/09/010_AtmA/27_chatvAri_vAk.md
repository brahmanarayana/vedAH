### Translation
27. Speech \[is\] four measured out quarters (*padá*); those are known  
by Brahmans who are skilful; three, deposited in secret, they do not set  
in motion (*in̄gay-*); a fourth of speech human beings speak.

### Notes
This verse is found, without variant, in TB. (ii. 8. 8⁵) and śB. (iv. i.  
3¹⁷), as well as in RV. ⌊vs. 45⌋. Our Bp.²D.Kp. read *ná: īn̄gayanti* in  
**c**.

Speech hath been measured out in four divisions: the Brahmans who have wisdom comprehend them. Three, kept in close concealment, cause no motion. Of Speech men speak the fourth division only.
