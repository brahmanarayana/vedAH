### Translation
25. The dung-made smoke I saw from far, with the dividing one, thus  
beyond the lower; the heroes cooked a spotted ox (*ukṣán*); those were  
the first ordinances.

### Notes
The construction and sense of **b** are very obscure. The verse is 43 of  
RV. i. 164, and the remaining three follow in order. ⌊Henry, *Mém. de la  
Soc. de linguistique*, ix. 247, cites the vs.⌋
