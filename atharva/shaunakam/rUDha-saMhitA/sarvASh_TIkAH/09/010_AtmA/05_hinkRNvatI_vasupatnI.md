### Translation
5. Lowing, mistress of good things, seeking her calf with her mind,  
hath she come unto \[it\]; let this inviolable one yield milk for the  
Aśvins; let her increase unto great good-fortune.

### Notes
This verse, again, is vii. 73. 8, above, excepting that the latter reads  
*nyā́gan* at end of **b**. Our *pada*-text has here *abhi॰ā́gāt*, while  
that of RV. ⌊vs. 27⌋ gives *abhí: ā́: agāt;* both yield the same  
*saṁhitā*-reading.

She, Lady of all treasures, hath come hither, yearning in spirit for her calf, and lowing. May this Cow yield her milk for both the Asvins, and may she prosper to our high advantage.
