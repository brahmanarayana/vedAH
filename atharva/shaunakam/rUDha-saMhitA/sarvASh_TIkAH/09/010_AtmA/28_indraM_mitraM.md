### Notes
Our *pada*-text differs from that of RV. ⌊vs. 46⌋ by dividing  
*bahu॰dhā́*.  
  
⌊The fifth *anuvāka*, with 2 hymns and 50 verses, ends here.⌋  
  
⌊One of our mss., P., sums up the book as of 8 *artha-sūktas* \[their  
vss. number 214\] and 7 *paryāya-sūktas* \[hymns 6 and 7: their ¶'s  
number 62 + 26 = 88\] or "15 *sūktas* of both kinds" reckoned together.  
Cf. the introduction, p. 517. The same ms., P., sums up the  
*avasānarcas* \[of hymns 6 and 7\] as 99 \[73 + 26\] and the "verses of  
both kinds" as 313 \[that is 214 + 99\]; but codex I. gives 302 \[that  
is 214 + 88\].⌋  
  
⌊The twenty-first *prapāṭhaka* ends here.⌋
