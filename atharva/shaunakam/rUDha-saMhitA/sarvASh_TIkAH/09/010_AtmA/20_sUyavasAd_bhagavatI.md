### Translation
20. Mayest thou be well-portioned, feeding in excellent meadows; so also  
may we be well-portioned; eat thou grass, O inviolable one, at all  
times; drink clear water, moving hither.

### Notes
We had this verse ⌊RV. vs. 40⌋ above, as vii. 73. 11.

Fortunate mayst thou be with goodly pasture, and may we also be exceeding wealthy. Feed on the grass, O Cow, through all the seasons, and coming hitherward drink limpid water.
