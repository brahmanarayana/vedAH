### Translation
9. The shaker-apart (? *vidhú*) that runs on the back of the sea, being  
young, the hoary one swallowed; see thou the poesy of the heavenly one  
with greatness; today he died, yesterday he received breath (*sam-an*).

### Notes
This verse is RV. x. 55. 5; also SV. i. 325 etc.; TA. iv. 20. 1; MS. iv.  
9. 12. All alike read *sámane bahūnā́m* for *salilásya pṛṣṭhé* (MS.,  
except in its *pada*-text, has other slight differences which are  
palpable blunders). *Vidhú* is (as at 8. 22, above) divided in  
*pada*-text *vi॰dhú*. It doubtless designates here the moon, however it  
may have won the right to do so. Ludwig and Hillebrandt (*Ved. Mythol.*  
i. 465) translate **d** 'today (he died yesterday) he has come to life';  
but this is in the highest degree forced, and may be pronounced even  
inadmissible. Ppp. reads *vidyudūdrāṇā* at the beginning. ⌊See  
*Kaṭha-hss.*, p. 82.⌋ The verse is quoted in Vāit. 40. 7; 41. 12.

The old hath waked the young Moon from his slumber, who runs his circling course with many round him. Behold the God's high wisdom in its greatness: he who died yesterday to-day is living.
