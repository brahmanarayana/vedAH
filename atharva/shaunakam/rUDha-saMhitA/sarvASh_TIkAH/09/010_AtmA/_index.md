### Comment
This hymn is in RV. a continuation of the preceding; but our vss. 9 and 23 are not found in the RV. with the rest (9 is RV. x. 55. 5 and 23 is RV. i. 152.3); ⌊while of 19, only d is found in RV., making, with the odd fifth pāda of our vs. 21, the first half of RV. i. 164. 42 (42 a, b = 21 e + 19 d); and our 24 (prose) does not occur in the RV. at all⌋. The first 23 verses are found also in Pāipp. xvi. The hymn is not quoted in Kāuś. (except as vs. 20 is also vii. 73. 11); but a few verses (9, 13, 14) are cited in Vāit.
