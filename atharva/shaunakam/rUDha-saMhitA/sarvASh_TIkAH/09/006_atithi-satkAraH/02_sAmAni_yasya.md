### Translation
2. Whose hairs the chants (*sā́man*), \[whose\] heart the sacrificial  
formula (*yájus*) is called, \[whose\] litter (*paristáraṇa*) the  
oblation.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *chandāṅsi* for *sāmāni* in **a**, and puts **c** before  
**b**. The unlingualized *st* of *paristáraṇam* is noted under Prāt. ii.  
105. The 'obvious *bráhman*,' or '*bráhman* in visible presence,' thus  
wondrously made up, is doubtless the guest, all attentions to whom the  
hymn proceeds to glorify by identifying them with sacred acts.
