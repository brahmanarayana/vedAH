### Comment
This whole prose hymn is found in Pāipp. xvi., except a few verses, as noted below. It is not quoted by either Kāuś. or Vāit. In the Prāt., on the other hand, it has more than its fair share of notice. ⌊With regard to the paryāya-hymns in general, see pp. 471-2.⌋


### Translations
Translated: Henry, 98, 137; Griffith, i. 448.
