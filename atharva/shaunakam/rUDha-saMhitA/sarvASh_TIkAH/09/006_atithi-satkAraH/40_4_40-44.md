### Translation
40. He who, thus knowing, pouring out milk, presents \[it\]—as much as,  
having sacrificed with a very successful *agniṣṭomá*, one gets  
possession of, of so much thereby does he get possession.

### Notes
The mss. are divided between reckoning ten verses (with the Anukr. ⌊cf.  
the quotations etc. at the end of the hymn⌋) in this section, or only  
five, with two parts to each; the latter method was adopted in our  
edition as the better. The second part in the first five verses, though  
doubtless meant only as prose, divides into three subdivisions of eight  
syllables each, like a real *gāyatrī*. Ppp. begins all the verses with  
*yat*, instead of *sa ya evaṁ vidvān*, and reads in 40 **b** *yā. ag.  
sapṛṣṭhene ’ṣṭvā ’varundhe*.

The man who having this knowledge pours out milk and offers it wins for himself as much thereby as he gains by the perfor- mance of a very successful Agnishtoma sacrifice.
