### Translation
44. He who, thus knowing, pouring out water, presents \[it\]—he arrives  
at (*gam*) firm standing in order to the generating of progeny; he  
becomes loved of progeny—he who, thus knowing, pouring out water,  
presents \[it\].

### Notes
The second part of the verse, though not metrical ⌊seems to be scanned  
as 11 + 11 + 8 + 8 by the Anukr. (which, with the mss., reckons  
*pratiṣṭā́m* to the second pāda!)⌋. Ppp. reads in **b** *gachati sarvam  
āyur eti: na punar ā jarasaṣ pra mīyate ya* etc.  
  
    
  
\[**Paryāya V.**—*daśakaḥ*. 45 **a**. *sāmny uṣṇih;* 45 **b**.  
*purauṣṇih*; 45 **c**, 48 **c** *sāmnī bhurig bṛhatī;* 46 **a**, 47  
**a**, 48 **b**. *sāmny anuṣṭubh;* 46 **b**. 3-p. *nicṛd viṣamā nāma  
gāyatrī;* 47 **b**. 3-p. *virāḍ viṣamā nāma gāyatrī;* 48 **a**. 3-p.  
*virāḍ anuṣṭubh*.\]
