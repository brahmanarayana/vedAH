### Translation
38. When the guest hath partaken he should partake, in order to the  
soulfulness of the sacrifice, in order to the integrity of the  
sacrifice; that is the \[proper\] course.

### Notes
The verse is an *uṣṇih* only as containing (if we resolve *aśitā́vati  
át-*) 28 syllables (11 + 14 + 3). The *pada*-text reads *aśītá॰vati*.  
Ppp. has *aśitāvaty aśnīyāt tad vrataṁ yajñasyā ’vichedāya yajñasya  
guptaye yajñasya sātmatvāya*. ⌊Cf. Oldenberg, IFA. vi. 184: also *Skt.  
Gram.* §960.⌋

When the guest hath eaten he should eat. This is the rule for the animation of the sacrifice and the preservation of its continuity.
