### Translation
61. Obtains this world, obtains yon \[world\].

### Notes
The translation implies emendation in 60 to *úpahāta-upahūtaḥ* (as  
repeated word); it seems impossible to give the verse a meaning as it  
stands. Vss. 60-62 are wanting in Ppp. The metrical definition of 61  
demands the resolution *-ti amúm*.
