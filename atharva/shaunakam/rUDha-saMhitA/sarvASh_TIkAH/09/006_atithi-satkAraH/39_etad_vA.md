### Translation
39. That verily is specially sweet which comes from the cow  
(*adhigavá*), either milk (*kṣīrá*) or flesh; that he should not partake  
of.

### Notes
That is, doubtless, he should leave it for his guest. The verse is  
wanting in Ppp. The so-called *gāyatrī* is to be thus divided: 7 + 11 +  
6 = 24.  
  
    
  
\[**Paryāya IV.**—*daśakaḥ.* **a** *of 40-43. prājāpatyā ’nuṣṭubh;*  
**a** *of 44. bhurij;* **b** *of 40-43. 3-p . gāyatrī;* **b** *of 44.  
4-p. prastārapan̄kti.*\]
