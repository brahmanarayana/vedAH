### Translation
49. When (*yát*) he calls the distributor, then he is just summoning  
(*ā-śrāvay-*).

### Notes
That is, he is virtually an *adhvaryu* summoning the *agnīdh* to do his  
duty. The verse is made an *āsurī gāyatrī* by resolving *-ty* twice.  
Ppp. inserts before this verse our vs. 23 above; and it omits *eva tat*.
