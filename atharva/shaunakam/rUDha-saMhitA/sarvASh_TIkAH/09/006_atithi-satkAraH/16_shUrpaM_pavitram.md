### Translation
16. The sieve ⌊*śū́rpa*⌋ is the soma-strainer (*pavítra*); the chaff is  
the pomace (*ṛjīṣā́*); the waters are those of pressing.

### Notes
That is, ⌊the waters are⌋ those used in facilitating the pressing of the  
Soma. ⌊Is not *śū́rpa* rather 'winnowing-basket'?⌋ The 'pomace' is the  
refuse stalks from which the soma has been pressed. ⌊All of SPP's and of  
W's *pada*-mss. seem to agree in reading *ṛjīṣā́* as fem.⌋ Ppp. reads  
*rajīṣaḥ*. It omits *abhiṣavaṇīr āpaḥ* here: but see vs. 17.

The winnowing-basket is the filter, the chaff the Soma dregs, the water, the pressing-gear.
