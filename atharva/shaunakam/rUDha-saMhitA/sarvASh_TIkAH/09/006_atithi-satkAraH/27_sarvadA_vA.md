### Translation
27. Verily he who presents \[the food\] hath always his pressing-stones  
harnessed, his cleanser wet, his sacrifice extended, his ceremony of  
offering assumed.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *sutasomas* instead of *yuktagrāvā*, and puts *vitatādhvaras*  
as last of the four epithets; it also sets the whole paragraph after our  
28.

The man who supplies food hath always pressing stones adjusted, a wet Soma filter, well prepared religious rites, and mental power to complete the arranged sacrifice.
