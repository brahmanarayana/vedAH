### Translation
51. When the servers, with drinking-vessels in their hands, both the  
former and the latter, go forward, they are just cup-bearing priests.

### Notes
Bp. gives the false accentuation *camasa॰ádh-* (instead of *-sá॰adh-*).  
Ppp. reads *yat pariveṣṭārā ’vasatāṁ prabhibhyante cam-.* To make 30  
syllables, we must resolve *ca ápare* (or else *camasá-adh-*).
