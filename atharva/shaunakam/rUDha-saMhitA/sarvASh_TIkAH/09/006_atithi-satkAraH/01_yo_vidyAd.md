### Translation
1. Whoever may know the obvious (*pratyákṣa*) *bráhman*, whose joints  
are the preparations (*sambhārá*), whose spine the verses (*ṛ́c*);

### Notes
Ppp. reads, instead of our **a**, as follows: *yo vā ekaṁ brahmā ’nuṣṭhā  
vidyāt sadya mahadvate*, making an *anuṣṭubh* of the verse. The Anukr.  
is corrupt at this point, one ms. appearing to call the verse *nāgī nāma  
tripād gāyatrū;* one sees no reason why.
