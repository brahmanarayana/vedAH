### Translation
31. Verily both what is sacrificed and what is bestowed of the houses  
doth he partake of who partakes before a guest.

### Notes
That is, doubtless, 'doth he eat up, devour, destroy.' Ppp. omits  
*gṛhāṇām*, and puts next vss. 34 and 33, omitting 35 and 39 ⌊and 32 and  
36 also⌋. The Anukr. describes the paragraphs as if they were metrical,  
and defines them as if the text read *pū́rvo átither*.
