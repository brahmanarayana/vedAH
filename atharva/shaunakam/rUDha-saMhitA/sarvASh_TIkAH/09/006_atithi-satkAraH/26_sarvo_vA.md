### Translation
26. Verily every such one has his sin undevoured whose food they  
partake not of.

### Notes
'Devoured,' doubtless 'destroyed, removed' by the eating of the guests.  
Ppp. reads for vs. 26 *sarvā upaśo jagdhapāpmānaṁ yasyā ’nnam aśnāti*.  
One of the Anukr. mss. (but doubtless by a misreading ⌊?⌋) calls 25 as  
well as 26 a *sāmny anuṣṭubh* ⌊16 syllables⌋. ⌊Vss. 25 and 26 have each  
15 (*āsurī gāyatrī*).⌋ Read in 25 *jagdhá-* (an accent-sign slipped  
out).

All that man's sin whose food they do not eat remains unblot- ted out.
