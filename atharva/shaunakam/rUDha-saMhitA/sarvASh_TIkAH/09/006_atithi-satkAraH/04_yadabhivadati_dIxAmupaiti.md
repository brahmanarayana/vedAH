### Translation
4. When he greets them, he enters upon consecration; when he offers  
(*yāc*) water, he brings forward the \[sacrificial\] waters.

### Notes
*Prá ṇayati* is quoted as an example under Prāt. iii. 79. We have to  
read *yā́cati apáḥ* to make out the defined meter.

When he salutes them reverently he undergoes preparation for a religious ceremony: when he calls for water, he solemnly brings sacrificial water.
