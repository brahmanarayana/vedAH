### Translation
9. In that they fetch a coverlet (? *upariśayaná*), thereby one gains  
possession of the heavenly (*svargá*) world.

### Notes
*Upariśayaná*, lit. 'above-lying,' occurs only here; ⌊but cf.  
*upariśaya*, OB. iv. 296 **c**⌋. The minor Pet. Lex. renders it 'an  
elevated couch.' The verse lacks a syllable.
