### Translation
47. For him the cloud, forming (*bhū*), utters *hing;* thundering, it  
preludes; lightenng, it responds; raining, it sings the *udgīthá;*  
holding up, it is the conclusion: the conclusion of etc. etc.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *vidyotamānaḥ pra stāuti stanayann ud gāyati aparāhṇa prati  
harati astaṁyaṁ nidhanam*. The "dissimilar *gāyatrī*," **b**, is this  
time 10 + 6 + 6 = 22. Bp.Bp.²p.m.D. read *várṣam*, and several of the  
*saṁhitā*-mss. *varṣaṁn* instead of -*ṣann*. Cf. Chānd. Upan. ii. 3.

For him the Rain-cloud murmurs when present, sings the pre- lude when thundering, joins in when lightening, chants the psalm when raining, and takes up the conclusion when it stays the downpour. He who hath this knowledge is the abiding- place of welfare, of progeny, and of cattle.
