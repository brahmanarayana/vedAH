### Translation
55. He ⌊the guest?⌋, being invited (*úpahūta*), feeds (*bhakṣay-*) on  
the earth; in him ⌊locative⌋, invited ⌊nominative⌋, \[he ⌊the host?⌋  
feeds on\] what of every form \[there is\] on the earth.

### Notes
⌊Whitney's first "on" is intended as a rendering of the locative  
relation of "earth"; his second "on" goes with "feeds." He has tried to  
indicate this by putting the first after the parenthesis and the second  
within the brackets. The inherent ambiguity of the English combination  
is such that I do not know how to remove it for the non-Sanskritist save  
by an express statement.⌋  
  
The sense of this and the following verses is very obscure; it is here  
translated as if the guest were the subject of the first *bhakṣayati*,  
and the entertainer (in recompense for the entertainment given) of the  
second ⌊*bhakṣayati* (supplied)⌋. Ppp. adds *pṛthivyāṁ tat pṛthivyām ā  
bhāti svargo loko bhavati ya evaṁ veda*. Only vs. 56 has the full number  
of syllables (27) belonging to an *ārcī bṛhatī;* 55, 58, 59 have only 26  
syllables (a number for which the system affords no separate name), and  
57 has only 24.
