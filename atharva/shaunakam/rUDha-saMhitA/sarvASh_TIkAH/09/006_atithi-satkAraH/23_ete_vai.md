### Translation
23. These same guests, both loved (*priyá*) and unloved, \[as\] priests  
(*ṛtvíj*), make \[one\] go to the heavenly world.

### Notes
This verse is wanting here in Ppp.; but it is inserted below, just  
before our vs. 49 ⌊and without variant except *cārtvijas*, which may be  
a slip of Roth's pen for *cartvijas*⌋.
