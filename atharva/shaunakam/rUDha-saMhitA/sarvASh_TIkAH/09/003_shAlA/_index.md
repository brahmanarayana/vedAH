### Comment
⌊Partly prose—25 to end.⌋ Found also in Pāipp. xvi. (in the verse-order 1-3, 5, 4, 6-10, 14, 16, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17, 21, 18, 20, 19, 24, 23, 22, 25-31). The hymn is not noticed in Vāit.; but several verses (1, 15, 18, 22, 24) are quoted in Kāuś. 66. 22-30, in connection with an inauguration-ceremony (savayajña) in which a house (a toy house?) is an object given.
