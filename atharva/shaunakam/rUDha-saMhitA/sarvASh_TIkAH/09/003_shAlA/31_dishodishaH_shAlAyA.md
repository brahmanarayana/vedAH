### Translation
31 . From every quarter, homage etc. etc.

### Notes
In the last verse *diśódiśaḥ* should have been printed without space  
before the repetition, as is our usage elsewhere.  
  
⌊After this hymn, which exceeds the norm by 11 verses, the quotation  
from the Old Anukr. is *ekādaśāi ’vo "’pamitām" iti syuḥ*.⌋
