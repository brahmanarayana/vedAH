### Translation
21. \[The dwelling\] which is fixed with two sides, with four sides,  
which with six sides—the eight-sided, the ten-sided dwelling, the  
mistress of the building, Agni lies in like an embryo.

### Notes
The *pada*-text reads *aṣṭā॰pakṣām* in **c**, by Prāt. iii. 2; iv. 94.  
⌊As to *pakṣa*, cf. iii. 7. 3.⌋ The verse is a good *pan̄kti*, involving  
only the resolution *mā́nasi-a* in **d**, but the Anukr. absurdly treats  
it as of four pādas; and, in accordance with this, the *pada*-mss. mark  
a pāda division after *śā́lām*.
