### Translation
6. What hanging vessels (? *śikyà*) they bound on to thee within for  
enjoyment, those we unfasten for thee; be thou, \[when\] set up, O  
mistress of the building, propitious to our self (*tanū́*).

### Notes
*śikyà* may be an ornamental hanging appendage of some kind.\* All the  
mss. read *mā́nasya patni* in **d**; our edition emends to *mān-*. The  
*pada*-text has *úddhitā*, undivided, in **e** (as at xviii. 2. 34, and  
*uddhíḥ* at viii. 8. 22); the case ought to fall under Prāt. iv. 62, but  
root *dhā* is not mentioned there, though we find *han* superfluously  
included. Ppp. reads *yāni te antaś cikyāny āmedho ‘ntyāya kaṁ;* and,  
for **d**, *sarvā mānasya patnyā.*  
  
\*⌊As to decorations of this kind, see John Griffiths, *The Paintings in  
the Buddhist Cave-Temples of Ajantâ*, London, 1896, plates 6, 10, and  
13; of. also Karpūra-mañjarī, iii. 27, ed. Konow, and my note thereon at  
p. 289. W. has interlined "slings" as an alternative rendering of  
*śikyà*.⌋

We loose the loops which men have bound within thee, loops to tie and hold. Be gracious, when erected, to our bodies, Lady of the Home.
