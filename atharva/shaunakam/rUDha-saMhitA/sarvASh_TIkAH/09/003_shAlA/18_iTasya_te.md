### Translation
18. Of thy rush-work (*íṭa*) I unfasten what was tied on, uncovering;  
\[thee\] pressed together by Varuṇa let Mitra in the morning open out.

### Notes
The verse in Kāuś. 66. 24 accompanies the letting down (*ava-sṛ*) of the  
door. ⌊Bergaigne has a note on the vs., *Rel. Véd.* iii. 122.⌋

I loosen and remove from thee thy covering formed by mats of reed. What Varuna hath firmly closed Mitra shall ope at early morn.
