### Translation
8. The thousand-eyed net (*ákṣu*), stretched out as *opaśá* on the  
division-line (*viṣūvánt*), tied down, put on, do we with worship  
(*bráhman*) unfasten.

### Notes
*Abhihita* in **c** doubtless contains the suggestion of *abhidhāni* 'a  
halter.' Geldner (*Ved. Stud.* i. 136) wants to make of *akṣu* a 'stake'  
or 'pillar.' *Viṣūvant* probably means the 'parting of the hair, crown'  
(so Zimmer), here the ridge of the roof. Ppp. begins with *yakṣmopiśam*,  
and has in **c** the easier reading *apinaddham apihitam*.
