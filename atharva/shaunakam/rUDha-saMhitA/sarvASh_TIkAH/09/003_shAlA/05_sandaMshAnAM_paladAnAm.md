### Translation
5. Of the clamps (*saṁdaṅśá*), of the *paladás*, and of the embracer  
(*páriṣvañjalya*)—now of the mistress of the building do we unfasten the  
tied \[parts\].

### Notes
Ppp. reads, in **a, b**, *palidānāṁ pariṣvañcanadasya ca;* and, for  
**c**, *sarvā mānasya patni te;* it also puts the verse before our 4.
