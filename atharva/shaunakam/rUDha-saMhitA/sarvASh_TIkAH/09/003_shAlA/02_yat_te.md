### Translation
2. What of thee is tied, O thou that possessest all choice things, what  
fetter and knot is made, that with a spell (*vā́c*) I make fall apart, as  
Brihaspati \[did\] Bala.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
All the mss. read *balám* (not *valám*) in **c**, as also Ppp.  
(*bṛhaspatiṁ vahaṁ balam*). Our Bp. has in **d** *sraṅśayāmi: tvát*. The  
Anukr. seems to imply the abbreviation of *iva* to *’va* in **c**.

All-wealthy House! each knot and band, each cord that is attached to thee I with my spell untie, as erst Brihaspati disclosed the cave.
