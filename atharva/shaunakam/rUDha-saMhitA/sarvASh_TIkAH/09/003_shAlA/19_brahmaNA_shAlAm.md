### Translation
19. The dwelling fixed with worship (*bráhman*), fixed, built by the  
poets—let Indra-and-Agni, immortal, defend the dwelling, the seat for  
soma (*somyá*).

### Notes
P. reads *nírmitām* in **b**, and *sāumyám* in **d**. Ppp. has a quite  
different version: *catussraktiṁ paricakrāṁ* for **a**; *viśvāna  
bibhratī śālām* (cf. our 16 **c**) *amṛto sāumyaṁ sadaḥ* for **c, d**.
