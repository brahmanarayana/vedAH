### Translation
23. I bring forward these waters, free from *yákṣma*, dispellers of  
*yákṣma*; I set forth unto the houses, together with immortal fire.

### Notes
We had this verse above, as iii. 12. 9. Ppp. (which omitted it as part  
of that hymn) reads in **a** *harāmi*, and in **c** *abhi* (for *upa*).

Water that kills Consumption, free from all Consumption, here I bring. With Agni, the immortal one, I enter and possess the house.
