### Translation
18. Below the distant whoever knows his father, below the distant, thus  
beyond the lower—who, playing the poet, shall proclaim \[him\] here?  
from whence \[is\] heavenly mind produced?

### Notes
RV. and Ppp. read, in **a, b**, *yó asyā ’nuvéda pará enā́-*, rectifying  
the meter and lightening the construction. Only the first two pādas have  
any "*jagatī*" character, and they are very irregular. But by giving  
this name the Anukr. shows that it reads our version; in RV. and Ppp.  
the verse is a pure *triṣṭubh*. Read in **d** *kúto* (for *kṛ́to*).

Who, that the father of this Calf discerneth beneath the upper realm, above the lower, Showing himself a sage, may here declare him? Whence hath the godlike spirit had its rising?
