### Translation
4. Who saw it first in process of birth, as the boneless one bears  
(*bhṛ*) him that has bones? where forsooth the earth's life (*ásu*),  
blood, soul? who shall go to ask that of him who knows?

### Notes
'Bears,' not in the sense of 'gives birth to,' but of 'carries' or  
'supports' or the like.

Who hath beheld at birth the Primal Being, when She who hath no bone supports the bony? Where is the blood of earth, the life, the spirit? Who may ap- proach the man who knows, to ask it?
