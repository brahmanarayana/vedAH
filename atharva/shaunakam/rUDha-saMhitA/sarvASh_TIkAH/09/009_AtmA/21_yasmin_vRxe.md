### Translation
21. On what tree the honey-eating eagles all settle and give birth—what  
they call the sweet berry in the top of it, that cannot he attain who  
knoweth not \[his\] father.

### Notes
RV. has *íd āhuḥ* instead of *yád āhúḥ* in **c**, and so also Ppp. (but  
*āhuṣ*). In RV. this verse follows after our vs. 22. There is a  
redundant syllable in **c** of which the Anukr. takes no notice (and the  
pāda is also capable of being crowded together into eleven syllables).

The tree whereon the fine Birds eat the sweetness, where they all rest and procreate their offspring Upon the top, they say the fruit is luscious: none gaineth it who knoweth not the Father.
