### Translation
1. Of this pleasant (*vāmá*) hoary invoker—of him the brother is the  
midmost stone (? *áśna*); his third brother \[is\] ghee-backed; there I  
saw the lord of the people who hath seven sons.

### Notes
The three brothers are explained as the three forms of Agni, in heaven,  
in the atmosphere (lightning), and on earth (sacrificial fire): the  
'seven sons' are most probably his many flames. ⌊The collocation of  
*madhyamó* with *bhrā́tā* would seem more natural, considering the phrase  
*tṛtī́yo bhrā́tā*.

The second brother of this lovely Hotar, hoary with eld, is the voracious Lightning. The third is he whose back is balmed with butter. Here have I seen the King with seven male children.
