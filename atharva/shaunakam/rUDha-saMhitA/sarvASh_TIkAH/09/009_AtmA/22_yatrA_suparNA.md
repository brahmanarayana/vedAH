### Translation
22. Where the eagles, with counsel (*vidátha*), sound incessantly  
(*ánimeṣam*) unto the draught of *amṛ́ta*,—thus the shepherd of all  
existence, he the wise one entered there into me that am simple.

### Notes
RV. reads *bhāgám* for *bhakṣám* in **a**. For *enā́* in **c**, RV. has  
*inás*, and Ppp. *yo no;* ⌊Ppp's *yo no* seems to be an attempt to make  
sense out of the rare and probably unintelligible *inó*⌋. ⌊The Kaṭha  
variant (WZKM. xii. 282) is *ánimiṣam*.\]  
  
⌊The quoted Anukr. says *navadaśe ca.*⌋

Where the fine birds hymn ceaselessly their portion of life eter- nal, and the sacred synods. There is the Universe's Guard and Keeper who, wise hath entered into me the simple.
