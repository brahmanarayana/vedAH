### Translation
11. On the five-spoked circumvolving wheel on which stood all  
existences—its axle, much-burdened, is not heated; even from of old it  
is not severed with the nave.

### Notes
RV. and Ppp. count this verse as 13, our version inverting the order of  
11-13. In **b**, RV. reads *tásminn ā́ tasthur bh. v.*, and Ppp.  
*samārohanti bh. v.;* and RV. has *śīryate* for *chidyate* in **d**.
