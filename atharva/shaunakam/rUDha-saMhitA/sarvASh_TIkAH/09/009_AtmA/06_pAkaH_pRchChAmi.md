### Translation
6. Simple, not discerning (*vi-jñā*) with the mind, I ask about the thus  
set-down tracks of the gods; over the yearling (? *baṣkáya*) calf have  
the poets stretched out seven lines (*tántu*) for weaving.

### Notes

Unripe in mind, in spirit undiscerning, I ask of these the Gods' established places. High up above the yearling Calf the sages, to form a web, their own seven threads have woven.
