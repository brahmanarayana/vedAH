### Translation
8. The mother portioned the father in righteousness, for with meditation  
(*dhītí*), with mind, came together in the beginning she, repugnant,  
womb-sapped, pierced; paying homage, verily, they went unto  
encouragement.

### Notes
The version is in part only mechanical. Ppp. combines *ṛtā ”babh-* in  
**a**, and reads *jajñe* at end of **b**.
