### Translation
7. I, not understanding (*cit*), ask here the understanding poets, I  
unknowing (*vid*), them that know; he who propped asunder these six  
spaces (*rájas*), in the form of the goat (? *ajá*)—was that also alone?

### Notes
The sense of the last pāda is utterly obscure, and the version given  
only tentative; *ajá* is perhaps here really the 'unborn one,' as the  
translators render it. RV. reads in **a** *ácikitvāñ cik-*, and, in  
**b**, *vidmáne*, for which our *vidvánas* is apparently a mere  
corruption.

Here, ignorant, I ask the wise who know it, as one who knows not, for the sake of knowledge, What is That One, who in the Unborn's image hath stablished and fixed firm this world's six regions.
