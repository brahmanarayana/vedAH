### Translation
15. Them, being women, they declared (*ah*) to me to be men; he who hath  
eyes may see, \[but\] the blind will not distinguish (*vi-cit*); the son  
that is a poet, he verily understood (*ā-cit*); whoever knows those  
things apart, he shall be \[his\] father's father.

### Notes
RV. and Ppp. put this verse after our vs. 16. It is found also in TA. i.  
11. 4, with *tā́ u* in **a**, *imā́s* in **c** for *īm ā́*, and *savitúḥ  
p-* in **d**. Some of our mss. (P.s.m.O.K.T.) reads *pitúḥ p-* in **d**;  
we had the phrase once before, at ii. 1. 2, and the combination falls  
under Prāt. ii. 73. We might expect, in **d**, *tā́ḥ*, referring to  
*stríyaḥ*, but the *pada*-texts have *tā́*, as neuter pl.

They told me these were males, though truly females. He who hath eyes sees this, the blind discerns not. The son who is a sage hath comprehended: who knows this rightly is his father's father.
