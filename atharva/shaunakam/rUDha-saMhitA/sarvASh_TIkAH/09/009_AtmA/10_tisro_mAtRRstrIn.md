### Translation
10. The one, bearing three mothers \[and\] three fathers, stood  
upright; verily they do not exhaust him; on the back of yon sky the  
all-knowing ones talk a speech not found by all.

### Notes
RV. reads *glāpayanti* at end of **b** ⌊and the translation follows that  
reading⌋, and, for **d**, *viśvavídaṁ vā́cam áviśvaminvām*. The  
*pada*-text reads *glapayanta;* Prāt. iv. 93 notes the case. Ppp. agrees  
with RV. in *glāpayanti* and *viśvavidam*.

Bearing three mothers and three fathers, single he stood erect: they never made him weary. On yonder heaven's high ridge they speak together in speech not known to all, themselves all-knowing.
