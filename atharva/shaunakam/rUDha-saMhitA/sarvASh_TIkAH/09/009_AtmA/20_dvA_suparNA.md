### Translation
20. Two eagles (*suparṇá*), joint companions, embrace the same tree; of  
them the one eats the sweet berry; the other looks on all the time, not  
partaking.

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **a** *suyujā*. Here and in the next verse, as everywhere  
else, some of our mss. read *píṣpalam*. ⌊The vs. plays a rôle in the  
Upanishads: cf. śvet. iv. 6; Muṇḍ. iii. 1. 1. Hillebrandt, *Ved.  
Mythol.*, i. 466, 399, treats this and the following vss.⌋

Two Birds with fair wings, knit with bonds of friendship, in the same sheltering tree have found a refuge, One of the twain eats the sweet Fig-tree's berry: the other, eat- ing not, regardeth only.
