### Translation
16. Of those born together the seventh they call sole-born; six, they  
say, are twins, god-born seers; the sacrifices (? *iṣṭá*) of them,  
distributed according to their abodes, quake in their station, being  
altered (*vi-kṛ*) in respect to form.

### Notes
*Iṣṭā́ni* in **c** might equally mean 'things desired.' *Sthātré* in  
**d** is most probably loc. of *-trá*, since, if from *sthātṛ́*, we  
should expect instead the ablative. ⌊The vs. recurs at TA. i. 3. 1 with  
*udyamā́s* for *íd yamā́s*.⌋

Of the co-born they call the seventh single-born: the six twin, pairs are called the Rishis, sons of Gods. Their good gifts sought of men are ranged in order due, and, various, form by form, move for their guiding Lord.
