### Translation
12. The five-footed father, of twelve shapes (*-ā́kṛti*), they call rich  
in ground (*purīṣín*) in the far (*pára*) half of the sky; then these  
others call \[him\] set (*árpita*) in the lower outlook that is  
seven-wheeled, six-spoked.

### Notes
RV. and Ppp. have the easier and better reading *vicakṣaṇám* in **c**,  
and Ppp. reads before it *upari*. ⌊The Kaṭha reading also is *úpari*,  
WZKM. xii. 282.⌋ Read in **b** *páre* (an accent sign slipped out of  
place). ⌊See Roth, KZ. xxvi. 66, and Windisch as cited in the  
introduction; cf. also IFA. vi. 181, as noted above.⌋

They call him in the farther half of heaven the Sire five-footed, of twelve forms, wealthy in watery store. These others, later still, say that he takes his stand upon a seven- wheeled car, six-spoked, whose sight is clear.
