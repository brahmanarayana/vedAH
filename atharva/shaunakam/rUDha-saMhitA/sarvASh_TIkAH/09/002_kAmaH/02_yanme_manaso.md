### Translation
2. What of my mind or my sight is not agreeable (*priyá*), what of me  
gnaws, does not enjoy (*abhi-nand*), that evil-dreaming do I fasten on  
my rival; praising Kāma, may I shoot up.

### Notes
The sense of **a, b** is very doubtful; without **b** added, **a** would  
naturally mean 'what is not agreeable to my mind or sight'; the Pet.  
Lex. proposes to help the difficulty rather by emending **b** to *yasmād  
bībhatse yac ca nā ’bhinande*. This verse and the following one are  
included in the *duḥsvapnanāśana gaṇa:* see note to Kāuś. 46. 9. There  
is an irregularity in every pāda, but the Anukr. does not heed them.  
Ppp. has, for **b**, *yan me hṛdaye na ’bhinandanti;* and, for **d**,  
*kāmaṁ juṣṭa hānudaṁ bhideyam*—thus giving us no help. ⌊Pischel treats  
the vs., *Ved. Stud.* ii. 61. Aufrecht, KZ. xxxiv. 459, sees here a root  
*bhas* 'verdriessen, taedere.'⌋

That which is hateful to mine eye and spirit, that harasses and robs me of enjoyment, The evil dream I loose upon my foemen. May I rend him when I have lauded Kama.
