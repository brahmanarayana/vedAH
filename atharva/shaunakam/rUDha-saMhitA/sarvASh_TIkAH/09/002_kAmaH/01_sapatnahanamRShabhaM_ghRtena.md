### Translation
1. The rival-slaying bull Kāma do I desire to aid (? *śikṣ*) with ghee,  
with oblation, with sacrificial butter; do thou, praised with great  
heroism, make my rivals to fall downward.

### Notes
Kāma, lit. 'desire, love,' is so thoroughly personified throughout the  
hymn that the word is better transferred than translated.

Kama the Bull, slayer of foes, I worship with molten butter, sacrifice, oblation. Beneath my feet cast down mine adversaries with thy great manly power, when I have praised thee.
