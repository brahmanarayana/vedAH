### Translation
14. With his heroes not safe ⌊*á-sarvavīra*⌋ let him go on, thrust  
forth, to be hated of friends, to be avoided of his own kin; on earth  
also stay (*ava-sā*) thunderbolts; may the formidable god massacre your  
rivals.

### Notes
The sense of **c** is obscure; *vidyútas* might also be object of the  
verb: 'they let loose thunderbolts.' Ppp. puts *dveṣyas* after  
*mitrāṇām* in **b**. The Anukr. calls the verse a *jagatī*, although it  
is a *triṣṭubh* with one *jagatī*-pāda (like 11). ⌊W. usually renders  
*sárvavīra* by 'with all \[his, our, etc.\] heroes.'⌋

To be avoided by his friends, detested, repelled, with few men round him, let him wander. Yea, on the earth descend the lightning-flashes: may the strong God destroy your adversaries.
