### Translation
24. Verily no wind soever attains (*āp*) Kāma, not fire, sun, also not  
moon; to them art thou etc. etc.

### Notes
Ppp. puts this verse before our 20, and reads for **c, d** *na vāpaś  
carta kāmam āpur nā ’horātrāṇi nihatāni yaṅtī na vāi puṇyajāś*  
⌊intending *puṇyajanāś?*⌋ *cana kāmam āpur na gandharvāpsaraso na  
sarpāḥ*. The Anukr. accounts the verse simply a *triṣṭubh* ⌊perhaps  
counting **b** as 10 and balancing it with the 12 of **c**⌋.

Not even Vata is the peer of Kama, not Agni, Chandramas the Moon, nor Surya. Stronger than these art thou, and great for ever. Kama, to thee, to thee I offer worship.
