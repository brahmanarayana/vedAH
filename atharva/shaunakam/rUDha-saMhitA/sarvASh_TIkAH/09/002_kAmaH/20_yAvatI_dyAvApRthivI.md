### Translation
20. How great in width are heaven-and-earth; how far the waters flowed,  
how far fire—to them art thou etc. etc.

### Notes
With **a** is identical iv. 6. 2 **a**. Some saṁhitā-mss. read  
*sisyadúr* in **b** (O.s.m.R.). ⌊I find no note of R.⌋ The meter is  
described by the Anukr. in accordance with that of vs. 11.

Wide as the space which heaven and earth encompass, far as the flow of waters, far as Agni, Stronger than these art thou, and great for ever. Kama, to thee, to thee I offer worship.
