### Translation
6. With the strength of Kāma, of Indra, of king Varuṇa, of Vishṇu, with  
the impulse of Savitar ('the impeller'), with the priestship (*hotrá*)  
of Agni I thrust forth my rivals, as a skilful pole-man (? *śambín*) a  
boat on the waters (*udaká*).

### Notes
*śambín* occurs nowhere else, and the meaning of *śámba* is doubtful.  
Ppp. reads in **c** *piśācān* instead of *sapatnān*.

By Kama's might, King Varuna's and Indra's, by Vishnu's strength, and Savitar's instigation, I chase my foes with sacrifice to Agni, as a deft steersman drives his boat through waters.
