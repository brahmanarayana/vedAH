### Translation
12. Let them float away downward, like a boat severed from its mooring;  
of them, thrust forth by missiles, there is no return again.

### Notes
The verse is nearly identical with iii. 6. 7 above. ⌊Ppp. reads in **c**  
*sāyakaṣ pra-*.⌋

Let them drift downward like a boat torn from the rope that held it fast. There is no turning back for those whom our keen arrows have repelled.
