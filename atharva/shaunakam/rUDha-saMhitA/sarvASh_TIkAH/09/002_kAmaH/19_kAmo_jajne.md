### Translation
19. Kāma was first born; not the gods, the Fathers, nor mortals attained  
(*āp*) him; to them art thou superior (*jyā́yāṅs*), always great; to thee  
as such, O Kāma, do I pay homage.

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **a, b** *prathamo nā ’nyat puro nāi ’naṁ devāsaṣ pitaro  
no ’ta martyāḥ;* and it combines in **d** *namāi ’t*. The verse (9 ⌊10?⌋  
+ 10: 12 + 11 = 42) is a queer "*triṣṭubh*."

First before all sprang Kama into being. Gods, Fathers, mortal men have never matched him. Stronger than these art thou, and great for ever. Kama, to thee, to thee I offer worship.
