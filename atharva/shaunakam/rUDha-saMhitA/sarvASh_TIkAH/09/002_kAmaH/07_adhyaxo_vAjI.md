### Translation
7. Let Kāma, my valiant (*vājín*) formidable overseer, make for me  
freedom from rivals; let the all-gods be my refuge; let all the gods  
come to this call of mine.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
'All' is *víśve* in **c**, and *sárve* in **d**. The verse is called  
*jagatī* by the Anukr., though only **d** is a *jagatī* pāda ⌊and that  
only by count⌋. Ppp. combines at the end of **d** *māi ’mam* ⌊and thus  
suggests the true metrical rendering of **d** as a *triṣṭubh:* similarly  
at ix. 3. 15⌋.

May Kama, mighty one, my potent warder, give me full free- dom from mine adversaries. May all the Deities be my protection, all Gods come nigh to this mine invocation.
