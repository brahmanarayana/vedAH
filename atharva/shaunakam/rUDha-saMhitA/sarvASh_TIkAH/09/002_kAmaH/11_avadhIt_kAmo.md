### Translation
11. Kāma hath slain (*vadh*) them that are my rivals; he hath made for  
me wide space, prosperity; let the four directions bow to me; let the  
six wide ones ⌊fem.⌋ bring ghee to me.

### Notes
The third pāda was found above as v. 3. 1 **c**. It is unusual for the  
Anukr. to note as *bhurij* a *triṣṭubh* containing a *jagatī-*pāda. ⌊Cf.  
Bergaigne, *Rel. Véd.* ii. 122.⌋

Kama hath slain those who were mine opponents, and given me ample room to grow and prosper. Let the four regions bow them down before me, and let the six expanses bring me fatness.
