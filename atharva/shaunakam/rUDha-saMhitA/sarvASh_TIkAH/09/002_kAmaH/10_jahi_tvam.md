### Translation
10. Slay thou, O Kāma, those that are my rivals; make them fall down to  
blind darknesses; be they all senseless (? *nírindriya*), sapless; let  
them not live any day soever.

### Notes
Ppp. combines *sapatnā ’ndhā* in **a-b**, combines and reads *nirindriyā  
’ravāḥ* in **c**, and has for **d** *yathā nu jīvāt katamac* ⌊-*maś*?⌋  
*cane ’ṣāṁ*.

Slay those who are mine enemies, O Kama: headlong to depth of blinding darkness hurl them. Reft be they all of manly strength and vigour! Let them not have a single day's existence.
