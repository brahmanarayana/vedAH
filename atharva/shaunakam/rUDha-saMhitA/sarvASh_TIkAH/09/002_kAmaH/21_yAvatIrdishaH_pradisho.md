etc. etc.

### Notes
The verse lacks two syllables of being a real *jagatī*.

Vast as the quarters of the sky and regions that lie between them spread in all directions, vast as celestial tracts and views of heaven, Stronger than these art thou, and great for ever. Kama, to thee, to thee I offer worship.
