### Translation
18. As the gods thrust forth the Asuras, as Indra drove (*bādh*) the  
barbarians to lowest darkness, so do thou, O Kāma, thrust forth far from  
this world those who are my rivals.

### Notes
Ppp. has again *tamo ‘pabādhe*, but this time *dūram*. The "*jagatī*"  
meter is like that of vs. 17.

As Gods repelled the Asuras, and Indra down to the lowest darkness drove the demons, So, Kama, from this world, to distant places, drive thou the men who are mine adversaries.
