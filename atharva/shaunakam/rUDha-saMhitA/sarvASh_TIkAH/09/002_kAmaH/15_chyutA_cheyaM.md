### Translation
15. This great \[earth\], both stirred and unstirred, bears the  
lightning and all the thunders; let the Āditya, arising with property,  
with brilliancy, thrust downward my rivals, he the powerful one.

### Notes
The first half-verse is wholly obscure, and the version given commits  
the grammatical solecism of taking *vidyút* as neut. accus. But for the  
last *ca*, *vidyut* might be taken as subject of the sentence. The verse  
has a *triṣṭubh*-pāda (**a**), of which the Anukr. makes no account.

This potent lightning nourishes things shaken, and things un- shaken yet, and all the thunders. May the Sun, rising with his wealth and splendour, drive in victorious might my foemen downward.
