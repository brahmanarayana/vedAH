### Translation
4. Thrust, O Kāma; thrust forth, O Kāma; let them who are my rivals go  
to ruin; of them, thrust to lowest darknesses, do thou, O Agni, burn out  
the abodes (*vā́stu*).

### Notes
The Anukr. takes no notice of the deficiency of two syllables in **d**,  
which in 9 **d** is made up by the addition of *anu*. In Vāit. 4. 5 the  
verse is strangely used to accompany the separation of two sacrificial  
ladles; in Kāuś. 48. 5 it accompanies the driving away of something with  
a branch.

Drive them away, drive them afar, O Kama; indigence fall on those who are my foemen! When they have been cast down to deepest darkness, consume their dwellings with thy fire, O Agni.
