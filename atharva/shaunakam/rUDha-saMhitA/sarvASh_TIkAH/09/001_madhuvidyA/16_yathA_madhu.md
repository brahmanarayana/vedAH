### Translation
16. As the honey-makers bring together honey upon honey, so, O Aśvins,  
let splendor be maintained in my self.

### Notes
Ppp. reads, for the second half-verse, *evā me 'śvinā balam ojaś ca  
dhriyatām:* cf. our 17 **c, d**. The line is, like the corresponding  
parts of 11-13, not metrical as it stands.

As honey-bees collect and add fresh honey to their honey store, Even so may both the Asvins lay splendour and strength within my soul.
