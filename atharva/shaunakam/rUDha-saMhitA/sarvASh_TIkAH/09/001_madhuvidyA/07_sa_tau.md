### Translation
7. He knows those two, he understands them that \[are\] its two  
unexhausted, thousand-streaming breasts; they milk out refreshment  
(*ū́rj*), unresisting.

### Notes
'Its,' i.e. of the 'honey-whip.' Ppp. reads again *akṣatāu* in **b**,  
and it puts this verse before our vs. 6.

He understandeth them, he hath perceived them, her breasts that pour a thousand streams, uninjured. They unreluctantly yield strength and vigour.
