### Translation
2. Great, all-formed \[is\] the milk of it; also they call thee the seed  
of ocean; whence the granting honey-whip cometh, thither breath, thither  
immortality (*amṛ́ta*) hath entered in.

### Notes
Ppp. puts *payas* in **a** after *viśvarūpam* ⌊and combines payo ‘syās⌋  
and puts *tvā* in **b** after *uta;* and it reads at the end *diviṣṭaṁ*.  
It also gives the verse after our vs. 3. The metrical definition of the  
Anukr. is wrong, since a fair *triṣṭubh* is restorable by a little  
resolution (*viśu-a*, *pṛ-āṇas*).

They call thee earth's great strength in every form, they call thee too the ocean's genial seed. Whence comes the Honey-whip bestowing bounty, there Vital Spirit is, and Amrit treasured.
