### Translation
18. What honey on hills (*girí*), on mountains, what in kine, in horses,  
in strong drink (*súrā*) as poured out, what honey \[is\] there, \[be\]  
that in me.

### Notes
With this verse and the next are to be compared vi. 69. 1, 2 ⌊where the  
use by Vāit. is given⌋. Ppp. has only *yadi giriṣyavipāṁ citviṣī* in  
place of this verse, and puts it before our 16.

May all the sweetness that is found in hills and mountains, steeds and kine, And wine that floweth from the cup,--may all that sweetness be in me.
