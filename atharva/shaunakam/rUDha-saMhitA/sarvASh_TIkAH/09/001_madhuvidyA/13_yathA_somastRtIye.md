### Translation
13. As at the third pressing soma is loved of the Ṛibhus, so, O Ṛibhus,  
let splendor be maintained in my self.

### Notes
This group of three verses is specially quoted at Vāit. 21. 7 to  
accompany an offering of *ājya*. It is one of the passages forming the  
*varcasya gaṇa* (see note to Kāuś. 13. 1); and at Kāuś. 139. 15 it is  
prescribed to be used, with many others, in the ceremony of initiation  
of a Vedic student. The verses are not metrical, though the Anukr. calls  
them *anuṣṭubh* (as having 31 and 32 syllables). In 12 **a** the  
accent-mark under *ye* has dropped out.

As at third sacrifice Soma is the Ribhus' well-beloved one, Even so may they, the Ribhus, store splendour and strength within my soul.
