### Translation
10. Thunder \[is\] thy voice, O Prajāpati; a bull, thou castest (*kṣip*)  
vehemence (? *śúṣma*) over the earth; verily from fire, from wind was  
born the honey-whip, the formidable daughter of the Maruts.

### Notes
The latter half-verse we had above, as 3 **c, d**; the former half-verse  
is repeated below, as 20 **a, b** ⌊with *diví* for *ádhi* at the end⌋.  
⌊Bloomfield thinks *śuṣma* is 'lightning': ZDMG. xlviii. 566.⌋ O. reads  
at the beginning *stanayitnúṣ ṭe*. The metrical description of the  
Anukr. means only that the syllables are 40 in all (10 + 12: 11 + 7),  
and that one pāda contains seven.

The thunder is thy voice, O Lord of Creatures: a Bull, thou castest on the earth thy vigour. The Honey-whip, the Manus' first-born daughter, derives her origin from Wind and Agni.
