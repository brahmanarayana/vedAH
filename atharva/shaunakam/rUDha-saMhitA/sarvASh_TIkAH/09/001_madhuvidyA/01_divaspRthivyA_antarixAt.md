### Translation
1. Verily from sky, from earth, from atmosphere, from ocean, from fire,  
from wind was born the honey-whip; noting (*cāy*) it, \[as\] putting on  
immortality, all creatures (*prajā́*) rejoice to meet it with their  
hearts.

### Notes
The irregularities of meter in **a** and **c** may be rectified ⌊very  
unsatisfactorily⌋ by combining *pṛthivyā́ ’nt-* (as Ppp. actually reads)  
and resolving *cāyitu-ā́*. *Divás p-* is prescribed by Prāt. ii. 68.

The Asvins' Honey-whip was born from heaven and earth, from middle air, and ocean, and from fire and wind. All living creatures welcome it with joyful hearts, fraught with the store of Amrit it hath gathered up.
