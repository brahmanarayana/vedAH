### Translation
24. When it thunders in a clear sky, that is Prajāpati himself becoming  
manifest to his creatures; therefore I stand with the sacred cord over  
the right shoulder, saying: O Prajāpati, take notice (*anu-budh*) of me:  
creatures \[take notice\], Prajāpati takes notice of him who knows thus.

### Notes
In order to make an aṣṭi (64 syll.) of this piece of prose, we have to  
restore *ánu* and separate *íti* in **d**, and to resolve *ánu enam* in  
**e**; and to make six pādas the last line has to be violently divided;  
the *pada*-text intimates a division after the second *ánu*. ⌊Ppp. in  
**a-b** has a *tat* also before *prajāpatis* and in **e** it reads  
*prajā budhyante* for *prajāp- budhyate*.⌋  
  
⌊The hymn begins with *divás* and the quoted Anukr. says *"divaś" ca  
catur-uttarāḥ* (referring to a plus of 4 over the normal 20).⌋

The thundering of Prajapati in heaven is verily manifest to living creatures. Therefore I stand from right to left invested, and, O Prajapati, I cry, regard me! The man who hath this knowledge is regarded by living beings and the Lord of Creatures.
