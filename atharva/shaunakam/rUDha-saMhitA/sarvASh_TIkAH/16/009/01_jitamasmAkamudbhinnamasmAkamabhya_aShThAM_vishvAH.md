### Translation
1. Ours \[is\] what is conquered, ours what has shot up; I have  
withstood all fighters, niggards.

### Notes
The verse is identical with the first part of x. 5. 36; and its second  
part, with vs. 2, is found in MS. i. 5. 3 (reading *abhy àsthām*).

Ours is superior place and ours is conquest: may I in all fights tread down spite and malice.
