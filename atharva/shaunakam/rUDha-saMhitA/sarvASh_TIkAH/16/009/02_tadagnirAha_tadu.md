### Translation
2. That Agni says; that, too, Soma says: may Pūshan set me in the world  
of the well-done.

### Notes
The two pādas are second and fourth pādas of a verse in MS. i. 5. 3  
(which rectifies the meter by reading *na ā́ dhāt* in place of *mā dhāt:*  
our own text probably ought to read *mā́*, i.e. *mā ā́*). With either of  
these readings, we have two faultless *triṣṭubh* pādas; but the Anukr.  
sanctions only 21 syllables. The first pāda is also found as viii. 5. 5  
**a** and xix. 24. 8 **c**.
