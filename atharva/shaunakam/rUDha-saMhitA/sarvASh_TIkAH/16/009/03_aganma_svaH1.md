### Translation
3. We have gone to heaven (*svàr*); to heaven have we gone; we have  
united (*sam-gam*) with the sun's light;—

### Notes
The first half is the beginning also of TS. i. 6. 6. In Kāuś. 6. 16, the  
verse is used in the *parvan* ceremonies, while one looks at the sun;  
but according to Dārila, this verse with the next is to be so used: ⌊and  
his view is accepted by SPP. (iii. 350¹⁶) and is supported by the  
suspension of the sense (see note to vs. 4)⌋. In Vāit. 24. 5, it is  
used, together with a RV. verse, to accompany the coming up from the  
bath in the *agniṣṭoma* ceremony. ⌊For the general import of this vs.,  
see p. 792, ¶ 2.⌋
