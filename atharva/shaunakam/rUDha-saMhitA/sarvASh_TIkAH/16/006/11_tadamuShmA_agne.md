### Translation
11. That, O Agni, let the gods carry away for yon man, that he may be  
impotent (*vádhri*), faltering, not good (*sādhú*).

### Notes
'For him,' here and in vs. 7, is plainly equivalent to 'to him,' or that  
they may be his. All the mss. accent *víthuras;* ⌊so SPP. reads with all  
his authorities⌋. As gāyatrī and *ārcy anuṣṭubh* both imply 24  
syllables, the Anukr. seems willing to give us our choice between them.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
⌊Perhaps we should understand the definition 3-p. *yavamadhyā  
gāyatrāvārcy anuṣṭup* as an '*anuṣṭubh* of 24 syllables, like (*iva:*  
not *vā*) a *3-p. yavamadhyā gāyatrī*' (7 + 10 + 7; *Ind. Stud.* viii.  
129): only this one divides rather as 8 + 10 + 6.—One is tempted to deem  
*agne* an intrusion and to regard the verse as a couple of simple  
*triṣṭubh* pādas: and the temptation is strengthened by the fact that  
the sole mark of pāda-division in W's Collation Book comes after  
*vahantu*.⌋

This, O Agni, let the Gods bear off to Such-an-one that he may be a fragile good-for-nothing eunuch.
