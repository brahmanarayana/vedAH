### Translation
27. ⌊30.⌋ Ours \[is\] what is conquered, ours what has shot up, ours  
right, ours brilliancy, ours *bráhman*, ours heaven, ours the sacrifice,  
ours cattle, ours progeny, ours heroes. ⌊31.⌋ From that we disportion  
him yonder: so-and-so, of such-and-such lineage, son of such-and-such  
mother, who is yonder; ⌊32.⌋ let him not be released from the fetter,  
the shackle of death. ⌊33.⌋ Of him now I involve the splendor,  
brilliancy, breath, life-time; now I make him fall downward.

### Notes
Some of the mss. read *pádviṅśat* or *páḍvīṅśat*. ⌊There should be an  
*avasāna*-mark in vs. 26 of the Berlin ed. after the second circle  
indicating omission.⌋

Whatever we have gained, whatever hath accrued to us, our Right, our energy, our Devotion, our heavenly light, our sacrifice, our domestic animals, our offspring, our men,--from all share herein we exclude Such-as-one, descendant of Such- an-one, son of Such-a-woman. Let him not be freed from the fetter and noose of Death. Here I bind up his splendour, his energy, his vital breath, his life, and cast him down beneath me.
