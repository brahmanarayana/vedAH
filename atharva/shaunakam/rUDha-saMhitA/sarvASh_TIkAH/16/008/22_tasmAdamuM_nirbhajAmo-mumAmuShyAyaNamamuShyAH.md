### Translation
22. ⌊25.⌋ Ours is etc. etc.; let him not be released from the fetter of  
the two congruent (*sam-yánt*) days. Of him now etc. etc.

### Notes
There is nothing elsewhere in the text to show what these two days are.  
Perhaps they are day and night over again, viewed as each a form or  
aspect of a day. ⌊The use of the obscure *saṁyánt* (with *ṛtú* and  
*śrī́*) at ix. 5. 33 should here be noted.⌋
