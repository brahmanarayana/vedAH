### Comment
⌊The discrepancy in the numeration of the subdivisions of the paryāya, as between the Bombay edition (which follows the Old Anukr.) and the Berlin edition, is of the same kind as in paryāya 5, above, and the explanation given above (p. 794, top) may be consulted. The numbers of the avasānas as given by SPP. are added by me in ell-brackets.⌋
