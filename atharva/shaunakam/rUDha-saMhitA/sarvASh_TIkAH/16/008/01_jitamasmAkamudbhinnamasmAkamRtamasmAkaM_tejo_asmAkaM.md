### Translation
1. ⌊1.⌋ Ours \[is\] what is conquered, ours what has shot up, ours right  
(*ṛtá*), ours brilliancy, ours *bráhman*, ours heaven (*svàr*), ours the  
sacrifice, ours cattle, ours progeny, ours heroes. ⌊2.⌋ From that we  
disportion him yonder: so-and-so, of such-and-such lineage, son of  
such-and-such mother, who is yonder; ⌊3.⌋ let him not be released from  
the fetter of seizure. ⌊4.⌋ Of him now (*idám*) I involve the splendor,  
brilliancy, breath, lifetime; now I make him fall downward.

### Notes
Here is again a partial correspondence with x. 5. 36. Compare also  
Āpast. iv. 15. 3. The addition *yajus* to the name *brāhmy anuṣṭubh* (48  
syllables) in the Anukr. seems, ⌊in the light of the corresponding  
expression at xvii. 1. 22, 23, intended to inform us that subdivision  
**a** is a *yajus;* but it is not apparent why the author should give  
this bit of information, which is (of its kind) so isolated: cf. third  
note to xv. 5. 7⌋.

Whatever we have gained, whatever hath accrued to us, our Right, our energy, our Devotion, our heavenly light, our sacrifice, our domestic animals, our offspring, our men,--from all share herein we exclude Such-an-one, descendant of Such- an-one, son of Such-a-woman. Let him not be freed from the noose of Grahi. Here I bind up his splendour, his energy, his vital breath, his life, and cast him down beneath me.
