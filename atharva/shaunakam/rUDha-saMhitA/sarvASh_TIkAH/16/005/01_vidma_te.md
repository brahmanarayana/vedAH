### Translation
1. ⌊1.⌋ We know thy place of birth (*janítra*), O sleep; thou art son of  
seizure (*grā́hi*), agent of Yama; ⌊2.⌋ ender art thou, death art thou;  
⌊3.⌋ so, O sleep, do we comprehend thee here; do thou, O sleep, protect  
us from evil-dreaming.

### Notes
The verses of this hymn are nearly ⌊vs. 6 exactly⌋ identical with vi.  
46. 2; and whether they or it are quoted in Kāuś. 46. 9, 13, it is  
impossible, and wholly unimportant, to determine ⌊cf. introd. to vi.  
46⌋.

We know thine origin, O Sleep. Thou art the son of Grahi, the minister of Yama. Thou art the Ender, thou art Death. As such, O Sleep, we know thee well. As such preserve us from the evil dream.
