### Comment

⌊Both the Anukramaṇīs reckon the paryāya as of 10 avasānas: that is, they count the anuṣan̄gas (b-c) only in their first and last occurrences, as explained at p. 793, end (cf. pages 628-9, 772).⌋ One or two of the mss. (W.R.) indicate by fragments of b and c given also with verses 2-5 that they regard all the six verses ⌊or gaṇas, rather⌋ as of equal length. ⌊It is true that the summations (see p. 793 and table) number the gaṇas as 2 and call the avasānarcas of the remaining 4 by the name of paryāya-avasānarcas; but it is not apparent why the gaṇas should not be counted as 6, just as those of the second paryāya of xi. 3 are counted as 18 (p. 632, top, p. 628, ¶ 10).—The numbers of the avasānas as given by SPP. in accord with the Anukr. are added by me in ell-brackets.⌋
