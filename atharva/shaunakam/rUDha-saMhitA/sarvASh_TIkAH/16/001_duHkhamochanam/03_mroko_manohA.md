### Translation
3. Dimming ⌊*mroká*⌋, mind-slaying, digging, out-burning,  
self-spoiling, body-spoiling.

### Notes
All these epithets are nom. sing. masc.; as *mroká* and *nirdāhá* are  
found together in v. 31. 9 as epithets of the flesh-eating fire, they  
are probably names of the fires mentioned in vs. 1: cf. also vs. 7,  
below; Ppp. combines *-dāhā ”tma-*. ⌊Weber (*Ind. Stud.* xiii. 185),  
discussing *mroká* as it occurs above at ii. 24. 3 in the long string of  
epithets, takes our *paryāya* here as an evening prayer (see p. 792),  
and notes the names of the ten Agnis here rehearsed in vss. 2, 3.⌋
