### Translation
1. Let go \[is\] the bull of the waters; let go \[are\] the heavenly  
fires.

### Notes
The verse, or the hymn (*paryāya*), is quoted in Kāuś. 9. 9, in the  
process of preparing holy water (*śāntyudaka*); with it one "lets go the  
waters," and then follow question and answer respecting the preparation.  
In Ppp. the initial *a* of *atisṛṣṭās* is not elided.
