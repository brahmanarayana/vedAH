### Translation
7. The fire that is in the waters, it do I let go, the dimming, digging,  
body-spoiling one.

### Notes
With this verse compare PGS. ii. 6. 10, used in the ceremonies  
commemorating the end of Vedic study. ⌊The definition of the Anukr.  
seems to be wide of the mark.⌋

I let loose the Agni who is within the waters, Mroka the up- rooter, the destroyer of the body.
