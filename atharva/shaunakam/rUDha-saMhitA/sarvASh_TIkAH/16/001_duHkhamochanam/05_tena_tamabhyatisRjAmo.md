### Translation
5. That one do we let go against him who hates us, whom we hate.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
These two verses form a part of vss. 15-21 in the water-thunderbolt  
(*udavajra*) hymn, above, x. 5 ⌊see my note⌋; and fragments of the same  
hymn are found further on in this *paryāya* and in 7. 6, 13, indicating  
some connection of application with that hymn, though Kāuś. suggests  
such connection only for xvi. 2. 1.
