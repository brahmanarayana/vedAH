### Translation
1. May I be the head (*mūrdhán*) of riches, the head of my equals.

### Notes
Or, perhaps, 'I am the head of the one, may I be so of the other.' The  
verse (or the *paryāya*) is quoted twice in Kāuś., once (18. 25) in the  
*citrā* ceremony, together with a whole series of other hymns or verses,  
in partaking of a milk-rice-dish; and once (58. 22), in the ceremony of  
giving food to a young child (*annaprāśana*), with a part of the same  
hymns.
