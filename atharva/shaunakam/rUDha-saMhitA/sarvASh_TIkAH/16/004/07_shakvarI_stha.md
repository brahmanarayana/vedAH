### Translation
7. Puissant (*śákvarī*) are ye; may cattle approach me; let  
Mitra-and-Varuṇa \[assign\] me breath-and-expiration; let Agni assign me  
dexterity.

### Notes
Nearly all our mss. (not T.s.m.R.) give *stheṣu* instead of *stheṣus;*  
⌊and so do three of SPP's⌋. ⌊For the form, see Gram. § 894 c.⌋  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
⌊Here ends the first anuvāka, with 4 *paryāyas* and 32 *avasānarcas:*  
see the summations at page 793, above. The piece here quoted from the  
Old Anukr. is *prājāpatyo ha catuṣkaḥ:* see p. 792.⌋

Mighty are ye, domestic creatures. May Mitra-Varuna stand beside me. May Agni give me inward and outward breath. May,he give me ability.
