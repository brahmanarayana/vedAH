### Translation
1. Seeking favor of the twenty-eight-fold (?) wondrous ones, shining in  
the sky together, ever-moving, hasting in the creation (*bhúvana*), I  
worship (*sapary*) with songs the days, the firmament (*nā́ka*).

### Notes
The translation implies our conjectural emendation of *turmíśam* ⌊two of  
W's mss., *-mich-*⌋ in **c** to *aṣṭāviṅśám* (or *-śā́*). ⌊This is  
supported by the textually unimpeachable *aṣṭaviṅśā́ni* of 8. 2 **a**,  
and the fact that the series in this hymn is actually of 28 members, as  
noted in the introduction.⌋ The comm. has *turmiśām*, and gives for it a  
double etymology and explanation: either it is *turmi* + *śā*, or it is  
*tur* + *miśā;* in the former case, *turmi* is from root *turv*, and  
means "injuring" (*hiṅsaka*), and *śā* is the root *śā* 'sharpen,' hence  
"make thin"; in the latter case, *tur* is ⌊a root-stem from⌋ root  
*turv*, and *miśā* is by Vedic license for *miṣā*, from root *miṣ*  
"contend" (*spardhāyām*); in either case, the compound means "putting  
down oppressors," and is adjective qualifying *sumatim!* All the mss.  
accent *saparyā́mi*, and SPP. admits it in his text; the accent is  
defensible, and would be required by Brāhmaṇa usage. Our emendation in  
**c** helps the meter as well as the sense; but no stress can be laid  
upon the circumstance that the Anukr. appears to regard the verse as a  
full *triṣṭubh*.

The brilliant lights shining in heaven together, which through the world glide on with rapid motion. And Days, and Firmament with songs I worship, seeking the Twenty-eight-fold for its favour.
