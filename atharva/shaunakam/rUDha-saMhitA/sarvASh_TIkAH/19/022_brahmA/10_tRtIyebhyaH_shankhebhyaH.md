### Translation
10. To the third conchs, hail!

### Notes
In 9 and 10, SPP. accents, with all the mss., *dvitīyébhyas* and  
*tṛtīyébhyas;* we have not hesitated to make the necessary emendations  
to *-tī́ye-*. ⌊The false accent is perhaps a blundering assimilation to  
that of *prathamébhyas:* cf. notes to vss. 13 and 14, and especially to  
xviii. 3. 47.—Two of W's later collated mss., D.L., have rightly  
*-tī́ye-*.⌋
