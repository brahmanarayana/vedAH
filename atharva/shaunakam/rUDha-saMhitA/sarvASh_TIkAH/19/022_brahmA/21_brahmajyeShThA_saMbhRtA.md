### Translation
21. Heroisms \[were\] gathered with the *bráhman* as chief; the  
*bráhman* as chief in the beginning stretched the sky; the Brahman was  
born as first of creatures; therefore (*téna*) who is fit to contend  
with the Brahman?

### Notes
Or (in **d**) 'with that (*téna*) Brahmán' SPP's text of the verse  
agrees with ours save that he accents in **d** *bráhmaṇā* with the mss.,  
and has in **c** *prathamó ’tá* (p. *-máḥ: utá*, though the *pada*-mss.  
read *-mā́: utá*); the text of the comm. has *-mo ’ta* here, but *-mo  
‘tha* in the verse repeated as 23. 30; the emendation in our text to  
*-mó ha* is plainly the easiest way out of the difficulty. The  
*pada*-mss. divide at the beginning, with remarkable absence of  
intelligence, *bráhma:* *jyeṣṭhā*, or *jyeṣṭhā́;* half the *saṁhitā*-mss.  
also accent *jyeṣṭhā́;* finally, the *pada*-mss., with incredible folly,  
divide at the end *spárddhi: tuṁkáḥ!* SPP. holds that the verse must  
have originally had *brahmán* throughout (four times), and gives in his  
note a text of it in that form (but with *prathamó ‘tha* in **c**); but  
it is far from improbable that *bráhman* was used in the first verse  
and *brahmán* in the second, as in our text. Indeed, in a corresponding  
verse in TB. (ii. 4. 7¹⁰), *bráhman* ⌊more appropriately, it would seem,  
if I am right in supposing that vss. 29 and 30 of hymn 23 refer to the  
Brahmaveda: cf. p. 932, l. 3⌋ is used every time: *bráhmajyeṣṭhā* (its  
commentary takes this as vocative) *vīryà sámbhṛtāni bráhmā ’gre  
jyéṣṭham dívam ā́ tatāna: ṛtásya bráhma prathamó ’tá* (! its comment  
paraphrases by simply *prathamám*) *jajñe ténā ’rhati bráhmaṇā  
spárdhituṁ káḥ*. Our comm. gives a second explanation of *brahmajyeṣṭhā*  
as = *brahmaṇā jyeṣṭhena*, the case-ending of the former word being  
omitted, as well as the *in* part of that of the second!

Collected manly powers are topped by Brahma. Brahma at first spread out the loftiest heaven. Brahma was born first of all things existing. Who then is meet to be that Brahma's rival?
