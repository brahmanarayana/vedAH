### Translation
1. Here have I come up to a better stop (*avasā́na*); heaven-and-earth  
have been propitious to me; let the directions be for me free from  
rivals; we verily hate thee not; be there fearlessness for us.

### Notes
The mss. read in **a** *uchréyas* (p. *ut॰śréyaḥ*); very possibly the  
true reading would be *u śréyas*. The *pada*-text fail to divide  
*avasā́nam* (it should be *ava॰sā́nam*, and this SPP. reads by  
emendation). Some mss. read *te* for *me* in **b**. Some of ours combine  
at the end *no ‘stu*. Āp. vi. 29. 1 has a corresponding passage: *idaṁ  
śreyo ‘vasanaṁ yad āgāṁ syone me dyāvāpṛthivī abhūtām: anamīvāḥ pradīśaḥ  
santu makyam: gomad...svāhe ’ty avasite juhoti:* cf. also Āp. xiii. 25.  
3.
