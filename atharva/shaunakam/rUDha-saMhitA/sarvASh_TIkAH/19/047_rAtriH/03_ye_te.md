### Translation
3. The men-watching lookers that are thine, O night, ninety \[and\]  
nine—eighty are they \[and\] eight, also seven \[and\] seventy of  
thine;—

### Notes
In **b**, SPP's *pada*-mss. have *navatī́ḥ*. In **c**, the decided  
majority accent *aśī́tis*, and all *santi*, which SPP. emends to *sánti*,  
thus changing "the ancient accent," and without sufficient reason, since  
*santi* is defensible, 3 **c** to 5 **b** inclusive being of the nature  
of a parenthesis, extending the *navatír náva* of 3 **b**. The *khila*  
⌊vs. 2⌋ to RV. x. 127 has a corresponding verse ⌊as also has śśS. at ix.  
28. 10⌋, with *yuktā́sas* for *draṣṭā́ras*, with *santu* in **c**, and ⌊so  
the *khila*, at least⌋ the accent *saptá* in **d**. The Atharvan mss.  
vary between *sápta* and *saptá;* our text gives the former, SPP. the  
latter, which is better, as being the usual Atharvan accent, and having  
⌊about⌋ half the mss. in its favor. The comm. explains the *draṣṭā́ras*  
as "troop-gods" (*gaṇadevās*), and does not so much as hint at any  
connection with the stars, which nevertheless we cannot well question to  
be meant, in their various and manifold groupings. A *ca* after *aṣṭāú*  
in **c** would be a welcome addition to both meter and sense.
