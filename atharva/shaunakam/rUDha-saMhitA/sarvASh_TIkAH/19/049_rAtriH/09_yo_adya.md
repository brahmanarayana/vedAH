### Translation
9. What thief shall come today, \[what\] malicious mortal villain, may  
night, going to meet him, smite away the neck, ⌊away⌋ the head of him;—

### Notes
The two following pādas ⌊10 **a, b**⌋ evidently belong to this verse  
rather than to verse 10; but our division is that of the mss. and the  
Anukr., and so is adopted also by SPP. The comm. inserts another line  
after our 9 **a, b**: *yo mama rātri surūpa āyati sa sampiṣṭo apāyati;*  
and then he divides the four lines that follow into two verses of four  
pādas each, giving eleven verses to the whole hymn. The majority of mss.  
accent *martyás* in **b**. The comm. reads *harat* for *hanat* at the  
end. Ppp. has *yu dya stenā yutv aghāyu mṛtyo ripuḥ;* and, in **d**,  
*pra gīyasva pra*. Pāda **a** is the **a** of iv. 3. 5, ⌊of which the  
**b** recurs here as the second pāda of the comm's inserted line and  
also as the fourth pāda of our vs. 10⌋.
