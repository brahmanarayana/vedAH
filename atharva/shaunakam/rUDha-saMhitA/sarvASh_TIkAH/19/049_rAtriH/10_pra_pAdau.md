### Translation
10. ⌊Away⌋ his feet, that he may not go; ⌊away⌋ his hands, that he may  
not harm.

### Notes
What marauder shall approach, may he go away all crushed; may he go  
away, may he go well away; may he go away in a dry place (?).  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
At the end of **b**, the majority of mss. read *yáthā́śiṣaḥ*, which all  
the *pada*-mss. resolve into *yáthā: áśiṣaḥ;* ⌊most of⌋ the rest, and  
SPP., give *yáthā́ ’śiṣat;* the comm. *yathā ”śliṣat* (= *saṁśleṣayet*).  
Ppp. offers *pra pādāu na yat āhataṣ pra hastāu na yanāśiṣat*. In **e**,  
the *pada*-mss. compound *su॰ápāyati*, doubtless wrongly; ⌊read as  
*pada*-text *sú: ápa: ayati*⌋. All the mss., the comm., and SPP., give  
in **f** *sthāṇāú*, and the comm. explains it as =  
*śākhopaśākhārahitavṛkṣamūla āśraye*. After it, the mss. have *apā́yataḥ*  
(p. *apa॰áyataḥ*), but the comm. agrees with us in *ápā ’yati*, and SPP.  
accordingly also adopts it. The translation follows throughout the  
emendations of our text; perhaps, in **f**, *sthā́ne* would be better  
than *sthalé*, as more closely resembling the ms.-reading. We are  
deprived of the help of Ppp. upon the point, as it skips from *apāyati*  
in **e** to *tṛṣṭadhūnam* in 50. 1 **a**; for **c, d**, it had *yo  
mulalaṁ sulapāyati sa saṁpiṣṭyo upāyati*. We had **d** above as iv. 3. 5  
**b**; ⌊cf. the end of the note to vs. 9⌋.

His feet that he may walk no more, his hands that he may do no harm. The robber who comes hitherward goes crushed and mutilated hence, Goes hence, goes far away from us, goes hence and bears no spoil away.
