### Translation
5. Propitious to me \[be\] night and \[the time\] after sunrise; be the  
mother of cold (*himá*) easy of invocation for us; notice, O  
well-portioned one, this song of praise, with which I greet thee in all  
the quarters.

### Notes
The translation implies in a a new conjectural reading: *śivā́ me rā́try  
anūsūryáṁ ca;* an accusative is opposed by the connection, and the meter  
needs another syllable. *Anūtsūryá* is venturesome, but we had  
*otsūryám*, p. *ā॰utsūryám*, above, at iv. 5. 7. At any rate, neither  
our text nor that of SPP. (*śivā́ṁ rā́trim anusū́ryaṁ ca*) seems to give  
any sense. Ppp. supports the mss.: *śivāṁ rātrim ahni sūryaṁ ca;* the  
majority of the *saṁhita*-mss. have *śivā́ṁ rā́trim ahi sū́-*, others *anu*  
for *ahi* (p. *śivā́m: rā́trim: anu॰sū́ryam: ca*); the comm. has  
*rātrimahi*, and understands it as *rātri* (voc.) *mahi* (= *mahāntam*,  
and qualifying *sūryam!*). ⌊SPP. suggests *śivā́ rā́trī mahī́ sū́ryaś ca*.⌋  
In **b**, Ppp. has *yamasya*. In **c**, nearly all the mss. read *aśvá*  
(or *áśva*) for *asyá;* and the *pada*-mss. treat it as an independent  
word; SPP. has *asyá*, with us. In **d**, a few mss. have *vándye* or  
*vádye*. Ppp. reads at the end *vikṣu*.

Kind through the Night be absence of the sunshine: Mother of Frost, may she be swift to hear us. Take notice of the hymn, thou highly favoured, wherewith I worship thee in all the regions.
