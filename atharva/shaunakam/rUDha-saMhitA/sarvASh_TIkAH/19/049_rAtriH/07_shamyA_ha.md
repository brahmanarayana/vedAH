### Translation
7. Pleasant names thou assumest:—whoso desire to damage my riches, them,  
O night, do thou burn continually, so that no thief be found, so that he  
be not found again.

### Notes
The translation follows our text, which is considerably altered from  
that of the mss. All of them, with the comm. and SPP., have at the  
beginning *śámyā*, for which our *rāmyā́* is, so far as the written form  
is concerned, a very easy emendation. The comm. explains: "thou wearest  
the name *śamyā* = *śatruśamanasamarthā*": one of his usual absurdities.  
Ppp. reads for **a, b** *śramyā ha nāma taruṣe vimṛcchantī yo janāṅ*.  
There seems to be no good reason why *dadhiṣé* should be accented.  
Nearly all the mss. give *dhánāḥ* at end of **b**; the comm. understands  
*dhanā*, and SPP. reads it. For **c** the *pada*-text is *rā́trī: hitā́*  
⌊or *hi: tā́*⌋: *naḥ: suta॰pā́!* The comm. understands instead *rā́trī ’hí  
tā́n asutapā́*, and SPP. follows him, making a new *pada*-text to  
correspond (*rā́tri: ihí: tā́n: asu॰tapā́*). The comm. explains *asutapā*  
as either "burning their life-breaths" (*asu-tapa*) or "badly burning"  
(*a-su-tapa*). Ppp. gives no help, reading ⌊for our **c**, **d, e**: it  
is not clear just how much of the reading is to be assigned to **c**⌋  
*rātri hīrcāna sadamātasteno anvavidyate*. Our emendation is fairly  
acceptable; but the *hí* ⌊which, with the imperative, hardly needs a  
separate word in translation⌋ requires that we accent *anutápa*. For our  
*yáthā*, in **d** and **e**, the mss. and SPP. give the first time *yás*  
and the second time *yát;* the comm. both times *yas;* the meter and  
sense alike call for our emendation. Ppp. has for both pādas only *ta  
steno anv avidyate*, ⌊which might (see above) be understood as *atas  
steno* etc.⌋.

Yes, Ramya is the name thou hast assumed. The men who fain. would spoil. My wealth do thou annoy, O Night, that not one robber may appear, none may a second time appear.
