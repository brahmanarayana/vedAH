### Translation
6. O thou of the assembly, protect my assembly (*sabhā́*), and \[them\]  
who are of the assembly, sitters in the assembly; having much invoked  
thee, O Indra, may they attain their whole life-time.

Day after day taking tribute to thee, O Agni, as fodder to a horse that stands [, let not us, O Agni, thy neighbors, receive harm, reveling with abundance of wealth, with food (_íṣ_)].

### Notes
The translation is to be taken simply for what it is worth, as it does  
not follow the mss., nor either printed text. At the beginning, the mss.  
⌊except several of W's, which have the impossible *sabhyá*⌋, SPP., and  
the comm., read *sabhyás*, which might well enough have been left by us  
unchanged, save for accent (viii. 10. 5 *sábhyas*). But the mss. read  
*sabhyás* again later ⌊save two of W's, which have *sabhyā́s*⌋, this time  
SPP. emends to *sabhyā́s* (should be *sábhyās*, with us?), since the  
comm. has this. In **c**, the mss. in general give *tvám indrā* (or  
*índrā*) *puruhūtya* (p. *puru॰hūtya*); the comm's text offers *tvām*  
⌊his exposition: *tvam*⌋ *indra puruhūta;* and SPP. adopts *tvám indrā*  
(p. *indra*) *puruhūta;* our conjecture, *tváyé ’d gā́ḥ puruhūta*, seems  
too violent, and the translation implies *tvā́m indra purū́huya*, with  
*aśnavan* at the end, while the mss., and SPP., have *aśnavat* (the  
comm. has the same, unblushingly explaining it as = *prāpaya*, a mere  
substitution of one person for another!), and our text emended to  
*-vam*, an ungrammatical but not wholly unprecedented form. ⌊The London  
ms. of the Anukr. adds as the *pratīka* of its vs. 6 *tvam indrā  
puruhūtye ’ti* (our 6 **c**: note the reading), but gives no metrical  
definition: the Berlin ms. does not even give the *pratīka*.⌋

None of the mss. have the second half-verse; it was added because it seemed called for by the first half, as in vss. 1 and 2. That the comm. and part of the mss., and so also SPP., in agreement with the Anukr., make only six verses in the hymn, was explained above under vs. 5. A majority of the mss. accent _bálim_ in **a** (including all those used by us before publication), and so the error has got into our text; SPP. has correctly _balím;_ some leave _hárantas_ without accent; the comm. and a ms. or two have _ítye_ for _ít te_ (= _prāptavye gṛhe vartamānāyā ’gnaye_, comm.). All the mss. have in **b** jātám instead of _ghāsám;_ but the comm. has the latter, and it is therefore read in SPP's text as well as in ours.
