### Translation
3. Evening after evening \[is\] Agni our house-lord; morning after  
morning \[is he\] giver of well-willing; be thou giver of good to us of  
every kind; may we, kindling thee, adorn (*puṣ*) ourselves.

### Notes
The third pāda is literally 'of good thing after good thing be thou  
giver of good.' The *pada*-mss. divide *vasu॰dā́naḥ: edhi* instead of  
*vasu°dā́ḥ: naḥ: edhi*, as is implied by our text; the meter makes us  
suspect that the true original reading was *vasudā́no na edhi*. The  
fourth pāda is v. 3. 1 **b** etc. (see under that verse). ⌊Cf. vs. 4.⌋
