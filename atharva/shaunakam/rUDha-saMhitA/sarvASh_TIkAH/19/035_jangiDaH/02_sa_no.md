### Translation
2. Let that *jan̄giḍá* defend us, as a protector of riches his riches;  
which ⌊*jan̄giḍá*⌋ the gods, the Brahmans, made a protector round about,  
slayer of niggards.

### Notes
The *pada*-mss. read at end of **b** *dhána॰iva;* ⌊SPP. emends to  
*dhánā॰iva*, which the translation implies;⌋ Ppp. gives *dhanāi ’va*.

So may this Jangida guard us, even as a treasurer guards wealth,. Even this which Gods and Brahmans made a malice-quelling sure defence.
