### Translation
3. The enemy of terrible aspect (*-cákṣús*), the evil-doer that has  
come—them do thou, O thousand-eyed one, make to vanish by thy  
watchfulness (? *pratībodhá*); thou art *jan̄giḍá* that protects round  
about.

### Notes
The translation implies in **a** emendation to *durhā́rdaṁ  
ghorácakṣuṣam*, which is venturesome, but something has to be done to  
make sense. SPP. reads, with ⌊most of⌋ the mss. and the comm.,  
*durhā́rdaḥ sáṁghoraṁ* (= *atyantakrūram*, comm.) *cákṣus;* the comm.  
⌊joins *cakṣus* with⌋ *nāśaya*. Ppp. gives no help; its text (*dūhārda  
saṁghora cakṣuṁ*) apparently is meant for the same with ours. In **b**  
is implied, instead of the *ā́ ’gamam* of the mss. and both editions,  
*ā́gatam*, which may be confidently accepted on the authority of both  
Ppp. and the comm. ⌊But *ā́dabhan* is read by W's O., by two of SPP's  
mss., and by a third,\* s.m.⌋ Our text emends at the end to *jan̄giḍá;*  
as all the authorities, including Ppp., give *-ḍaḥ*, this is retained in  
the translation. In **d** the comm. appears to have *pratib-*, but it is  
very probably an oversight of the ms. The Anukr. takes no notice of the  
deficiency of a syllable in **c**. \*⌊The carefully corrected Dc.⌋

Hard-hearted men, the cruel eye, the sinner who hath come to- us, Destroy thou these with watchful care, O thou who hast a. thousand eyes. Thou, Jangida, art my defence.
