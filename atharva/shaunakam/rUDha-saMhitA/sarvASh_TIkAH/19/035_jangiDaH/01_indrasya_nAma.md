### Translation
1. Taking (*grah*) the name of Indra, the seers gave the *jan̄giḍá*,  
which the gods in the beginning made a remedy, spoiler of the  
*víṣkandha*.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The comm. (apparently by an oversight) explains at the end  
*viṣkandhabheṣajam*, while his text, according to SPP., agrees with  
ours.
