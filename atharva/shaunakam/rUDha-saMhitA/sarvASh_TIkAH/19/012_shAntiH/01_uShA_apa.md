### Translation
1. The dawn, with nobleness, makes the darkness roll together \[and\]  
away on her sister's track; therewith may we win the prize (*vā́ja*) set  
by the gods; may we revel, living a hundred winters, rich in heroes.

### Notes
The sense of the first half-verse is difficult and doubtful. *Ápa* in  
**a** is really an emendation ⌊following RV.⌋, all our mss. ⌊save B.,  
which has *áṣaḥ*⌋, and very nearly all SPP's (only one has *ápa* ⌊and  
one, *apá*⌋) reading instead *ápaḥ;* the comm. has *apa*. Half ⌊of SPP's  
authorities, and one or two of W's⌋ give in **b** *suyātátā*. The comm.  
amuses himself with etymologizing *svasṛ* as *svayant eva sāriṇī*.

Dawn drives away her sister's gloom, and through her excellence makes her retrace her path. Through her may we gain God-appointed treasure, and with brave sons be glad through hundred winters.
