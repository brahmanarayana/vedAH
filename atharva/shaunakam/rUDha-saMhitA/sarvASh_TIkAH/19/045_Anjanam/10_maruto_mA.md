### Translation
10. Let the Maruts favor me with troops, in order to breath etc. etc.

### Notes
Ppp. reads this time *suprabhūtaye*. It is possible to make out of these  
prose "verses" the number of syllables demanded by the Anukr. Perhaps  
the modification *nicṛt* belongs only to vss. 7-9 (the manuscripts are  
discordant and unclear).  
  
⌊Here ends the fifth *anuvāka*, with 12 hymns and 74 verses.⌋

May the Maruts protect me with their troops for inspiration and expiration, for strength, for energy, for vigour, for weal and prosperity. All Hail!
