### Translation
1. Bringing together witchcraft to the house of the witchcraft-maker, as  
it were debt from debt, do thou, O ointment, crush in the ribs of the  
hostile eye-conjurer.

### Notes
With the second half-verse compare ii. 7. 5 **c, d**. The first half  
seems to mean "paying back or returning...as debt upon debt, or repeated  
debt"; this is, except for the sense given to the ablative *ṛṇāt* (which  
he explains by *ṛṇāt...bhītaḥ*, or, alternatively, *ṛṇadātur  
uttamarṇāt:* both wrongly), the understanding of the comm. ⌊Griffith  
says: "As debt from debt: as a man returns to his creditor a part of  
what he owes him."⌋ Many of the authorities give *riṇā́d riṇám* (Ppp. has  
*ṛṇ-*); and some accent the first syllable, *ri-* or *ṛ-*. At the end of  
**a**, nearly all have *saṁnayáṁ* (p. *sam॰nayám*), but the comm.  
*saṁnayan*, which SPP. adopts (*saṁnáyan*) and which is followed in the  
translation above, as being a smaller alteration of the original than  
our emendation *sáṁ naya*, and at least equally acceptable in point of  
sense. In **c** the comm. has the bad reading *cakṣur mitrasya*. Ppp.  
ends **d** with *āñjanam*.
