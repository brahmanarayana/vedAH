### Translation
6. Let Agni favor (*av*) me with fire (? *agní*), in order to breath, to  
expiration, to life-time, to splendor, to force, to brilliancy, to  
well-being, to welfare: hail!

### Notes
The comm. is uncertain whether by the second *agni* (*agninā*) is meant  
*agniīvadharmeṇa*, or *pāvakādiguṇakena svamūrtyaniareṇā ’gninā  
sahitaḥ*. All the mss. accent *subhūtáye* here, ⌊but *súbhūtyā* at iii.  
14. 2 (cf. *Grammar* §1288 e): SPP. accents here *-táye*, with the mss.;  
but the Berlin text *sú-* here, in conformity with both editions and the  
mss. at iii. 14. 1⌋. Ppp. reads *mā agninā*.  
  
    
7. Let Indra favor me with what is Indra's (*indriyá*), in order to  
breath etc. etc.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
{{smaller block\|The comm. gives a double interpretation of *indriya*.  
Ppp. again has *mā indriy-*.
