### Translation
3. Increasing from the force of the refreshment of the waters, born out  
of Agni Jātavedas—may the ointment that is four-heroed, that is of the  
mountains, make the quarters, the directions, propitious to thee.

### Notes
In **a**, *ūrjás* might, of course, be ablative, coördinate with  
*ójasas;* the whole expression is too obscure to help the construction  
by the sense. The comm. reads *ūrjam;* Ppp. combines *ūrjo ’jaso*, and  
has in **c** *parvataṁ*. The Anukr. does not heed the redundant syllable  
in **c**.
