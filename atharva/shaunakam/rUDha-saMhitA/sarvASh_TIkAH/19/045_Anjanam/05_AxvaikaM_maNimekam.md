### Translation
5. Use thou one as ointment; make one an amulet; bathe with one; drink  
one of them; let the four-heroed one protect us about from the four  
destructive bonds of seizure (*grā́hi*).

### Notes
All the mss.\* have at the beginning *ā́kṣva*, which the *pada*-text  
leaves undivided; SPP. goes so far as to emend the latter to *ā́: akṣva*,  
but is unwilling to follow us in reading *ā́ ’n̄kṣva*, although *akṣva* is  
no possible form, and the comm. agrees with our emendation. Ppp. reads  
*ākṣakaṁ maṇ-*. In **b** the mss. give *ékenā́pivāíkam*, and the  
*pada*-mss. resolve it into *ékena: ápi: vā: ékam*. Our emendation to  
*ékena píbāí ’kam* is evidently just what is required; but SPP. chooses  
to retain *ékenā́*, and so reads ⌊in *pada*-text⌋ *ékena: ā́: piba*,  
remarking that "if RW. had discerned the *ā́* after *ékena*, their very  
correct emendation would have been free from the defect of unnecessarily  
changing the ancient accent of the *saṁhitā*-text." This reads like a  
joke, considering how the text of book xix. (not to speak of previous  
books) abounds in gross errors of accentuation, and how often we and he  
have been compelled to emend it—for example, in the preceding verse,  
where the "ancient accent" *cāryà* was changed by him to *cā́rya*. ⌊Apart  
from this passage,⌋ the compound *ā + pā* does not occur in the  
Atharvan, and, although it is not unknown, it would be distinctly out of  
place here. The version of the pāda in Ppp. is totally corrupt:  
*śvāśīkenapavīkam eṣām*. The comm. reads *ekenā ’vivekam eṣām*, and  
labors, with his usual ill-success, to devise an explanation of  
*avivekam*. To *ekam* etc. he supplies *āñjanam;* as his reading gets  
rid of the fourth, he connects the first three with the "three-peaked  
mountain" from which the ointment is derived: *triṣu parvatakakutsū  
’tpannāni!* Apparently the fourfold-ness is related in some way or other  
to the "four-heroed"-ness. In **d**, the comm. commits the extraordinary  
blunder of taking *grāhyās* as gerundive: *grahītavyā āñjanamayā  
oṣadhayaḥ!* and this compels him to change *pātu* to *pāntu*. The  
*pada*-mss. (except one of SPP's, p.m.) have *grā́hyā*, they also failing  
to recognize the not uncommon noun *grā́hi;* SPP. makes the necessary  
emendation to *-hyāḥ*. \*⌊But SPP's S^(m)., *ākṣvā́ikam*.⌋

Make one thy salve, thine amulet another, drink one, and with another bathe thy body. So let the Chaturvira keep us guarded from the four bonds of Nirriti and Grahi.
