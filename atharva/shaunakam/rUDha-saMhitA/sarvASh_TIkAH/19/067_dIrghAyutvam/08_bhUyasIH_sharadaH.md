### Translation
8. More autumns than a hundred.

### Notes
The comm.\* reckons the hymn as only one verse; the Anukr. and all the  
mss. ⌊see SPP's ed., p. 543, note 1⌋ count eight verses, and SPP. also  
adopts this. The first two verses are the last two pādas of RV. vii. 66.  
16; they are found also in GGS. iii. 8. 5; a third verse, with  
*śṛṇuyāma*, is added in PGS. i. 6. 3; ⌊MS., at iv. 9. 20, has four  
pādas, with *śṛṇuyā́ma* pushed to the fourth place by the insertion of  
*prábravāma* (ed. *prábruv-*) in the third;⌋ and the series is carried  
further in VS. xxxvi. 24, which, beginning as does PGS., has five pādas,  
⌊with *prábravāma* in the fourth, and *ádīnāḥ syāma* in the fifth, and⌋  
with the added ending *bhū́yaś ca śarádaḥ śatā́t*, which needs emendation.  
⌊MGS., at i. 22. 11, agrees with VS.⌋ In TA. iv. 42. 5 and in HGS. i. 7.  
10 ⌊the series is carried to eight pādas⌋: these agree from 1 to 7 ⌊with  
*páśyema, jī́vema, nándāma, módāma, bhávāma, śṛṇávāma, prábravāma*⌋, and  
differ only in the eighth, where TA. has *ájītāḥ syāma* against *ajitāḥ  
syāma* of HGS.; and both have the added ending *jyók ca sū́ryaṁ dṛśé*. In  
none of the other versions is there anything to help us with the  
doubtful forms in the Atharvan. In vs. 3, most of the mss. read  
*búddhema* (some *búdhema*); our emendation *búdhyema* is given also by  
the comm., and SPP. adopts it. In vs. 5, on the other hand, the mss.,  
the comm., and SPP., give the wholly anomalous *pū́ṣema* (= *puṣṭim  
labhemahi*, comm.); SPP. ought to have emended to *púṣyema*, as we had  
done. *Bhū́yema* (= *bhūyāsma*, comm.) in vs. 7 is another impossibility  
retained by SPP. In vs. 8 all the mss. have *bhū́yasī* ⌊or *-āsī*⌋; but  
the comm. has *-sīs*, and so SPP. has the courage to adopt and read it,  
as we had done before. \*⌊At p. 543⁹.⌋
