### Translation
23. To the ruddy ones (*rohita*), hail!

### Notes
The mss. ⌊except W's O.D., which have *róh-*⌋, and hence also SPP.,  
accent here *rohitébhyas*. The comm. remarks that in this and the  
following verses the books intended are clear. This, of course, means  
book xiii. ⌊which is designated by *rohitāis* at Kāuś. 99. 4⌋.
