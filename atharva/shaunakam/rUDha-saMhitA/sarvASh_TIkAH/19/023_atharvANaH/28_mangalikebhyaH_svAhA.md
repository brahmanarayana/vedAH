### Translation
28. To them of good omen (*man̄galiká*), hail!

### Notes
This, from its position, ought to signify book xviii.; the comm. says  
nothing about it; his text reads *mān̄g-*. ⌊That the funeral book is held  
to be most inauspicious appears from SPP's preface to his ed., vol. i.,  
p. 4, p. 5, and especially p. 2. To call the book auspicious is a  
euphemism such as is familiar in the case of the dreadful god śiva.⌋ One  
of our mss. (I.) inserts after this verse five others which do not  
appear to occur elsewhere, as SPP. does not mention them:  
*nákṣatrakalpāya svā́hā*. 29. *vāítānakalpāya svā́hā*. 30. *śāntikalpāya  
svā́hā*. 31. *an̄girasakalpāya svā́hā*. 32. *sā́ṁhitāvidhaye* *svā́hāṁ*. 33.  
Our 29 then follows, in the form *tulibrahmáṇe svā́hā*, and our 30 as  
given in all the mss.: *bráhmajyeṣṭé ’ty ékā*. ⌊The foregoing are the  
readings of the Collation Book: apart from the accents, they require  
correction, I suppose, to *ān̄girasa-* and *saṁhitā-*.⌋
