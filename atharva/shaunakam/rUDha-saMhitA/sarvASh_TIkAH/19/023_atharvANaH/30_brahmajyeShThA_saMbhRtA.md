### Translation
30. Heroisms were gathered with the *bráhman* as chief; the *bráhman* as  
chief in the beginning stretched the sky; the Brahmán was born as first  
of creatures; therefore who is fit to contend with the Brahmán?

### Notes
This is a repetition of 22. 21 above; the commentator's text apparently  
gives it in full, as SPP. notes that (doubtless only by an accident) it  
reads this time in **c** *prathamo ‘tha*.

Collected manly powers are topped by Brahma. Brahma at first spread out the loftiest heaven. Brahma was born first of all things existing. Who then is fit to be this Brahma's rival?
