### Translation
26. To the two of Prajāpati, hail!

### Notes
The two *anuvākas* of book xvi. are evidently intended, though why they  
are called *prajāpatya* is difficult to say. ⌊The Major Anukr. calls the  
whole book *prājāpatya*, as noted p. 792, ¶4.⌋ The Old Anukr. quoted in  
the endings says at the end of xvi. 4 *prājāpatyo ha catuṣkaḥ*, ⌊····⌋  
*saptakaḥ paraḥ:* i.e. 'the \[first\] Prajāpati-*anuvāka* has four hymns  
⌊or *paryāyas*⌋; the \[*paryāya*\] next after \[2 and 3: i.e. *paryāya*  
4\] is one of seven verses.' ⌊For the probable relative position and the  
significance of these extracts, see p. 792 (¶5)-793.⌋
