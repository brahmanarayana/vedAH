### Translation
2. What \[defenses\] he who is lord of creation, Prajāpati, Mātariśvan,  
made for his creatures (*prajā́*), what ones the directions and the  
quarters put on (*vas*)—let those defenses (*várman*) be abundant  
(*bahulá*) for me.

### Notes
The mss. accent *vasaté* ⌊except several that have *vasate*⌋; our  
emendation to *vasáte* is unquestionably called for, even though there  
are a few cases in RV. of such accent as *vasaté* ⌊*Gram.* § 613⌋. The  
comm. etymologizes *mātariśvan* as *antarikṣe śvasitī* '*ti*. ⌊The  
verse is properly 12 + 11: 11 + 11: for **d** has *triṣṭubh* cadence,  
and there are three possibilities of excising a syllable from its prior  
half.⌋

All that the World's Lord made, all that for creatures Prajapati and Matarisvan fashioned, All things within the quarters and their spaces, let all these be my manifold defences.
