### Translation
3. They call the heavens (*dív*) three, the earths three, the  
atmospheres three, the oceans four, the song of praise (*stóma*) triple,  
the waters triple: let these triple ones defend thee with the triple  
ones.

### Notes
In Ppp., **b** and **c** have apparently dropped out, and **d** is made  
to end with *trivṛtās trivṛttibhiḥ*. The mss. vary between *trivṛ́ta*  
(which both editions read), *trivṛ́tās*, and *trivṛ́tāt;* the translation  
implies *trivṛ́tas*, which the comm. has, and which is pretty evidently  
the intent of the verse; ⌊cf. vs. 9 **d**, below⌋. The mss. to a great  
extent read *tṛv-* instead of *triv-*, as in other like cases. In **a**  
in our text, emend to *tisráḥ*. We need to combine *trivṛtā ”pa ā-* in  
**c** to make a good *triṣṭubh*. ⌊I doubt if it is a *triṣṭubh*. To  
reckon *trī́ṇi* to pāda **a** is very harsh. I suspect we have to  
pronounce *pṛthvī́s* in **a**, and to read and pronounce *trī́ṇy  
antárikṣā* in **b**. Thus the verse scans as 8 + 11: 11 + 11.⌋

Three are the earths, they say, and three the heavens, three are the atmospheres, and four the oceans. Threefold the hymn of praise, threefold the Waters. Let these with triple song and triplets guard thee.
