### Translation
2. Let Soma protect thee with the herbs; let the sun protect with the  
asterisms; \[let\] the moon, Vṛitra-slayer, \[protect\] ⌊thee⌋ from the  
months; let the wind defend with breath.

### Notes
All the mss. without exception read in **c** *mādbhyás*, instead of the  
*mādbhís* which we should have expected, and which the comm. has. It  
seems like a blundering confusion of the two cases (the reverse of that  
in 22. 1, above). The comm. makes *nakṣatra* here refer to the planets,  
most unnecessarily; he reads in **d** *rakṣati*, but glosses it with  
*rakṣatu*.

Let Soma guard thee with the plants, Surya protect thee with the stars; With breath let Wind protect thee, and the Moon, foe-slayer, with the months.
