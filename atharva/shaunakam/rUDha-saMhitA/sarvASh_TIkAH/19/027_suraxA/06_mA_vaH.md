### Translation
6. Let not the wily ones damage your breath, nor your expiration nor  
flame (? *háras*); shining, all-possessing, run ye, O gods, with what is  
of the gods.

### Notes
The translation implies emendation of *devā́s* in **d** to *dévās;* the  
comm. understands *dévās*, but doubtless only by his customary disregard  
of the accent. He understands *vas* in **a** ⌊altenatively⌋ as *plur.  
majest.* of the king on whom the amulet is bound, and *haras* in **b**  
as *śatrubalāpahārakaṁ tejas*. To *dāivyena* in **d** he supplies  
*rathādinā sādhanena vegena vā*. We are tempted to emend at the end to  
*dāívyenā́ ”dhāvata;* Ppp. reads *māvata* for *dhāvata*.
