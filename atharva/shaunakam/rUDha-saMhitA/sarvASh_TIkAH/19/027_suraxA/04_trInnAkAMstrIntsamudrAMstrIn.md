### Translation
4. The three firmaments (*nā́ka*), the three oceans, the three bright  
ones (*bradhná*), the three at the summit (? *vāiṣṭapá*), the three  
Mātariśvans, the three suns, do I arrange (*kḷp*) as thy guardians.

### Notes
Nearly ail the mss. read in **a** *nā́kaṅs*, and a part also  
*bradháṅs*.\* The comm. has *badhnān*, and ⌊some of⌋ our mss. also  
*badh-*, although SPP. strangely appears to find no *badh-* among his  
authorities. The *pada*-mss. give *nā́kam* and ⌊some of them⌋ *bradhnán*.  
Some mss. accent *mātáriś-* in **c**, and read *goptrī́n* in **d**. All  
these are of the superficial variety of discordant readings which swarm  
in this book, and have no real importance. The comm. explains his  
*badhnān* thus: *trīn badhnān badhnaḥ sarvasya bandha ādhārabhūta  
ādityaḥ*, in which he shows himself equal to the occasion after  
precisely his own fashion. The Anukr. takes no notice of the metrical  
irregularity (7 + 7: 9 + 7 = 30). ⌊Roth notes expressly that Ppp. reads  
*vāiṣṭapān*.⌋ \*⌊Cf. note to 13. 8 above, and to 28. 2; also Müller's  
1st quarto ed. of RV., vol. 1., preface, p. xii; and Pischel, *Gram. der  
Prakrit-sprachen*, §83.⌋
