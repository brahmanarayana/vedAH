### Translation
9. The treasured (*ni-dhā*) treasure of the gods that Indra discovered  
by roads that the gods travel—the gold did the waters guard with triple  
ones; let those triple ones defend thee with the triple ones.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The last pāda is a repetition of 3 **d**, and has the same readings as  
there in mss.,\* editions, and comm. Instead of *índro ‘nv-* in **a, b**  
the mss. give *indrā ’nv-* (p. *indra: anu-*); but this time SPP. also,  
as well as we, emends to the former reading, which is that of the comm.  
⌊*Nidhiṁ devā́nāṁ níhitaṁ yám índraḥ* would be good rhythm.⌋ \*⌊Or nearly  
so: but *trivṛ́tā* of 3 is here *tṛvátā*.⌋
