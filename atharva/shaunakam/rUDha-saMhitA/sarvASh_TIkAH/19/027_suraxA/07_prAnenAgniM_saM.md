### Translation
7. One unites Agni with breath; the wind is combined with breath; with  
breath the gods generated the sun that faces all ways. ⌊See p. xxxvi,  
n.⌋

### Notes
All the mss. (save one of SPP's, which has *-jāti*) read *sṛjati* in  
**a**, and, as the meter favors it, it might better stand (our text  
emended to *-anti*). Ppp. gives for **a** *prāṇenā ’gniṁ saṁ dadhata*,  
and ⌊reads and⌋ combines at the end ⌊*suryaṁ*⌋ *devā ’janayan*.
