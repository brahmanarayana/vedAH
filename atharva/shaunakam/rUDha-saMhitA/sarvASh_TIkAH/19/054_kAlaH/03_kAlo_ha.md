### Translation
3. ⌊Comm's 2 **d, e**.⌋ Time, \[their\] son, generated of old what is  
and what is to be. ⌊Comm's 3 **a, b**.⌋ From time the verses (*ṛ́c*) came  
into being; the sacrificial formula (**yájus**) was born from time;—

### Notes
In the first half-verse, the translation follows the mss. ⌊they read  
*kāló* and *putró*⌋, rather than our emendations ⌊*kālé*\* and  
*mántro*⌋, which seem more venturesome than there is reason for; and  
departs from them only in assuming at the end *purā́*, instead of  
*púras*, as the mss. in general read (*purā́* is accepted by both  
editions, and is supported apparently by Ppp., and to a certain degree  
by one of SPP's mss. which has *púrā*). Perhaps *púnaḥ* ⌊which Whitney's  
I. actually has⌋ is a yet more plausible substitute for *púraḥ*. Ppp.  
has *kālena bhūtaṁ janayat:* ⌊so Roth's Collation: I take it to mean  
"*kālena bhūtaṁ* in **a** and *‘janayat* in **b**"⌋; and the comm. also  
has at the beginning *kālena* ⌊which he glosses with *pitrā prerakeṇa:*  
cf. his *putras* in **b**, and cf. 53. 4 **c**⌋; and at the end of **b**  
he seems to have read *puras* ⌊the word does not actually appear⌋, since  
he gives *purastāt* for explanation. In **c**, part of the mss. have  
*abhavat*. \*⌊As *kāló* is given by all the mss. collated by W. before  
publication, *kālé* was indeed an emendation; but some of SPP's  
authorities do have *kālé*.⌋

In Kala erst the text produced what is and what is yet to be. From Kala sprang the Richas, and from Kala was the Yajus born.
