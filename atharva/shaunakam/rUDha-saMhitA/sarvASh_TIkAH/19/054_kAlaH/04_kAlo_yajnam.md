### Translation
4. ⌊Comm's 3 **c, d**.⌋ Time set in motion (*sam-īr*) the sacrifice, an  
unexhausted portion for the gods. ⌊Comm's 4 **a, b**.⌋ In time are set  
firm the Gandharvas-and-Apsarases; in time the worlds;—

### Notes
In **a**, the translation implies *kālás*, with all the authorities, but  
*āirayat*, against nearly all of them; the comm. gives *āirayat* and  
SPP. accepts it; ⌊and it is supported by his ms. P. (which has  
*āirayan*, p.m., corrected to *āirayat*) and by Ppp's *īrayat*. Ppp.  
reads *kālo yajño sam īrayat*, and has at the end *samāhitāḥ*.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
    
⌊5 and 6 of Berlin ed. = 5 of Bombay ed.⌋ ⌊Comm's 4 **c, d**.⌋ Upon time  
stand this heavenly An̄giras and Atharvan. ⌊Comm's 5 **a, b**.⌋ Both this  
world and the highest world, and the pure (*púṇya*) worlds and the pure  
separations—⌊6 of Berlin ed.: Comm's 5 **c, d**.⌋ all worlds by the  
*bráhman* having conquered, this time goes on as highest god.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Verses 5 and 6 of our edition are here combined into one, on the  
authority of the Anukr. and part of the mss., and in accordance with  
SPP. Of the mss. compared by us before printing, all made a sixth verse  
of the last two pādas. In **a**, the mss. read *kāléyám* ⌊W's O. has  
*kāleyám*⌋ (p. *kāleyám* or *kāléyam*) ⌊SPP's *pada*-ms. Cp., here  
unaccented, has kāleyam; SPP. emends the *pada*-text to *kālé: ayám*,  
but strangely presents a *saṁhitā*-text inconsistent with this, namely  
*kālé ‘yám*, instead of *kālè ‘yám*, as our edition reads. All the mss.  
read *divó ‘th-* in **a-b** (p. *diváḥ*), but SPP., on authority of the  
comm., emends to *devó ‘th-*, and the translation follows this; Ppp.  
also reads *devo ‘th-*. ⌊At the end of **b**, the comm. reads  
*tiṣṭhati*.⌋ In **d** a number of the mss. give *vídhṛtīṅś ca;* the  
obscure word is passed over lightly by the comm., who simply glosses it  
with *lokadhārakān*. The last pāda is identical with 53. 2 **d**, ⌊save  
that it has *paramó* where 53. 2 **d** has *prathamó*⌋, and Ppp.  
combines, as there, *sāiyyate*. The most natural count of syllables (8  
+ 8: 11 + 11: 11 + 12 = 61) comes three short of a full *aṣṭi:* ⌊the  
*jagatī* cadence of **e** suggests that something is missing (read  
*sárvāṅś ca lo-*?) in that pāda; and **f** is to be read (like 53. 2  
**d**, with Ppp. double *saṁdhi*) as 11 syllables⌋. ⌊Here ends the sixth  
*anuvāka*, with 9 hymns, and with 63 verses as they are numbered by the  
Berlin text and summed up by certain mss.; but the Anukr. counts 9 and 5  
verses (instead of 10 and 6) in hymns 47 and 54 respectively, which  
makes the sum 61 instead of 63.⌋
