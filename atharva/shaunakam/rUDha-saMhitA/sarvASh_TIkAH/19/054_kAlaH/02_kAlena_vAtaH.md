### Translation
2. ⌊Comm's 2 **a, b, c**.⌋ By time the wind cleanses (*pavate*); by time  
the earth \[is\] great; the great sky in time \[is\] set.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
A part of the verse is lost in Ppp. The comm. adds the first two pādas  
of our vs. 3 to this one, and makes then the three remaining verses of  
four pādas each. This makes a decidedly better division, so far as the  
sense is concerned; but the mss., the Anukr., and SPP. agree in the  
division given in our text (except as regards vs. 6), and it is  
accordingly retained here.

By Kala freshly blows the wind, mighty through Kala is the Earth: on Kala rests the mighty Sky.
