### Translation
1. From time came into being the waters; from time \[came\] the  
*bráhman*, fervor, the quarters; by time the sun rises; in time he goes  
to rest (*ni-viś*) again.

### Notes
All the mss. save two ⌊of SPP's⌋ read *abhavat* at end of **a**; SPP.  
also ⌊as well as the Berlin ed.⌋ gives *-an*, with the comm., and with  
Ppp. In **b**, the comm. reads *vratatapas* for *bráhma tápas*.
