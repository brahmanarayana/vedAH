### Translation
4. Him who frees from distress, the bull of the worshipful, him that  
shines forth (*vi-rāj*), the first of the sacrifices (*adhvará*), the  
child of the waters, O Aśvins, I call with prayer (*dhī́*); do ye with  
Indra give me Indra-like force.

### Notes
A corresponding verse in TS. (in i. 6. 12³) reads thus: *prá samrā́jam  
prathamám adhvarā́ṇām aṅhomúcaṁ vṛṣabháṁ yajñíyānām: apā́ṁ nápātam aśvinā  
háyantam asmín nara indriyáṁ dhattam ójaḥ*. It helps us least in the  
critical part of our verse, where the mss. all read *aśvínā huvé*  
⌊*huve, havé*⌋ *dhíya* (p. *dhíyaḥ*) *indriyéṇa ta* (p. *te*) *indr-*.  
The translation follows our emendation (*aśvinā*, with TS.; *dhiyé  
’ndreṇa ma indr-*). SPP. follows the mss. Ppp. nearly agrees with them:  
*aśvināu huve dhiya indriyeṇa na indriyaṁ dhattam ojaḥ*. The comm. has  
*dhiyam* and *dhattām* (but his text, according to SPP., reads  
*dhattam*).
