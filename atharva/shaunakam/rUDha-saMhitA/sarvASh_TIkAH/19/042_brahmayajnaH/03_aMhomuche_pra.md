### Translation
3. To him who frees from distress I bring forward my devotion  
(*manīṣā́*), unto him who rescues well, choosing to myself his favor;  
accept, O Indra, this oblation; let the desires of the sacrificer be  
realized.

### Notes
Or (at the end) 'come true.' A corresponding verse is found in TS. (in  
i. 6. 12³) and in MS. (in iv. 12. 3). In **a** both read *bharemā* ⌊p.  
*-ma*⌋ *manīṣā́m*, thus rectifying the meter; and Ppp. does the same; for  
**b**, TS. gives *oṣiṣṭhadā́vne sumatíṁ gṛṇānā́ḥ* ⌊good grammar (plural  
*-nā́s*) and good meter⌋; MS. *bhūyiṣṭhadā́vne sumatím āvṛṇānáḥ* ⌊bad in  
both respects⌋. Very nearly all the AV. authorities give in **b** *-tím  
mā vṛṇānáḥ;* ⌊per contra, cf. note to xviii. 2. 3⌋. One would like to  
get rid of the superfluous *ā́* at the beginning of **b** by emending to  
*āśutrā́vṇe* ⌊*āśu-* would accord closely in sense with the *oṣiṣṭha-* of  
TS.⌋. ⌊Our *bhare* is evidently a corruption due to haplography, which  
has brought in its train the further corruption of *āvṛṇānā́ḥ* to *-náḥ*.  
In **c, d**, TS.MS. agree throughout\* with AV. ⌊save that MS. has  
*juṣasva* for *gṛbhāya*. In **c**, Ppp. has *havyā;* only parts of the  
verse are left in its text; ⌊Roth says the first word is lost⌋. The  
comm. reads *sutrāmṇe* in **a**, *-tiṁ gṛṇānaḥ* (like TS.) in **b**, and  
*havyā* (like Ppp.) in **c**. \*⌊In **c**, the *idám* of the Berlin text  
is an emendation, since all the mss. collated by W. before publication  
have *imám;* and it is confirmed by TS.MS., which give *idám*, and by  
W's subsequently collated O., and apparently also by his L. But SPP.  
prints *imám* without note of variant; and the comm. has *imam*, which  
he makes = *idam* in the sense of *idānīm!*⌋

To him who frees from woe mine hymn I offer, to the Good Guardian, as I seek his favour. Accept this offering of mine, O Indra. Fulfilled be all the sacri- ficer's wishes!
