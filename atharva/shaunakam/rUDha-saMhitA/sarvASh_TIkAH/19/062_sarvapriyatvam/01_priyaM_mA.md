### Translation
1. Make thou me dear to the gods, make me dear to kings, dear to  
everything that sees, both to śūdra and to Āryan.

### Notes
A nearly corresponding verse is found in the supplement to RV. x. 128  
(Aufr.², p. 685), and in HGS. i. 10. 6, ⌊and in *Kaṭha-hss.*, p. 36⌋. In  
the first half-verse, RV. differs only by reading both times *kuru;* its  
**c** is *priyaṁ viśveṣu gotreṣu*, and its **d** entirely different from  
ours. HGS. also has *kuru*, with *mā brahmaṇi* for *rājasu mā* in **b**,  
and the second half-verse reads *priyaṁ viśyeṣu śūdreṣu* cf. ⌊*rúcaṁ  
víśyeṣu śūdréṣu*, VS. xviii. 48⌋ *priyam mā kuru rājasu*. The mss. read  
in **c-d** ⌊with varying accent⌋ *paśyato ’ta* (p. *paśyata: uta*); ⌊but  
one of SPP's *pada*-mss. has *paśyatáḥ*, p.m.⌋; and a part of the mss.  
(including ⌊so far as noted⌋ all the *pada*-mss.) have *śūdrám* in  
**d**. SPP's text agrees throughout with ours. ⌊With this verse Zimmer  
compares 32. 8, above, and VS. xviii. 48 etc. With the **d** of the  
Berlin text, cf. the **d** of iv. 20. 4 and 8. Zimmer rightly notes that  
the "gods" of **a** are the Brahmans, and aptly cites śB. ii. 2. 2⁶,  
with 32. 8 etc. as just mentioned.⌋
