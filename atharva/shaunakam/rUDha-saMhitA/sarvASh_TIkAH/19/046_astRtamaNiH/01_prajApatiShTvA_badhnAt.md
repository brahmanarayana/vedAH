### Translation
1. Prajāpati bound thee first \[as\] unsubdued (*ástṛta*), in order to  
heroism; it do I bind for thee in order to life-time, to splendor, and  
to force and to strength: let the unsubdued one defend thee.

### Notes
*Astṛta* is literally 'not laid low.' In the two occurrences above (i.  
20. 4: v. 9. 7) it is accented on the final; but, as *ástṛta* would be  
the normal accent, it is left here unchanged in our text, as well as in  
SPP's. The *pada*-texts read in **a** *badhnāt*, but that is no reason  
why we should not understand it as *abadhnāt*, and our text (not SPP's)  
so prints it. Our text further emends at the beginning of **c** the  
*tát* of the mss. to *táṁ*, as required by the gender of *astṛtas*. The  
omission of *badhnāt* in **a**, and of *várcase* in the second  
half-verse, would make an *anuṣṭubh* (apart from the refrain); but the  
meter throughout the hymn is unusually careless of regularity, and Ppp.  
has both words, reading in **a, b** *badhnātu prathama saṁbhṛtaṁ*, and  
in **d, e** combining *varcaso ’jase* and *ca astṛtas*. ⌊With **c, d**,  
cf. iv. 10. 7 **c, d**.⌋

For manly strength Prajapati bound thee on first, invincible. This for long life on thee I bind for splendour, strength, and energy. Invincible, let it guard thee well.
