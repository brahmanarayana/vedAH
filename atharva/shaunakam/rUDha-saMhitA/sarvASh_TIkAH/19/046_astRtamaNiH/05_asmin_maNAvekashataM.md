### Translation
5. In this amulet \[are\] a hundred and one heroisms; a thousand breaths  
in this unsubdued one; a tiger, do thou attack (*abhi-sthā*) all \[our\]  
rivals; whoso shall fight against thee, be he inferior (*ádhara*): let  
the unsubdued one defend thee.

### Notes
SPP. reads in **b** *asmin;* our *asmín* is given by a small minority of  
the mss.; the majority have *ásmin*, some *asmin*, one *asmìn*. ⌊The vs.  
(11 + 10: 11 + 11 + 8 = 51) is a *triṣṭubh* (defective in **b**), with  
the refrain added: see introd.⌋

One and a hundred manly powers, a thousand lives hath this Amulet, unconquered ever. Go forth a tiger, strike down all thy foemen: let him who would oppose fall low beneath thee. Invincible, let it guard thee well.
