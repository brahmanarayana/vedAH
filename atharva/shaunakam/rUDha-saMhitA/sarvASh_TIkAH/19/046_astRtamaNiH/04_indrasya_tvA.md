### Translation
4. With Indra's defense (*várman*) we surround thee, who became  
over-king of the gods; let all the gods lead thee forward again; let the  
unsubdued one defend thee.

### Notes
A part of the verse ⌊pāda **b**, it would seem?⌋ has fallen out in Ppp.;  
⌊this has *dhāmāi* for *dhāpayāmo*⌋. The meter is insufficiently defined  
by the Anukr. (13 + 11: 11 + 8 = 43): ⌊see introduction, above⌋.

Around thy limbs I place the mail of Indra who hath become the Gods' imperial Sovran. Again let all the Deities bring thee hither. Invincible let it guard thee well.
