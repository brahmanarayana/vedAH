### Translation
1. A yellow eagle, thou hast ascended unto heaven (*dív*) with radiance  
(*arcís*); whoso (pl.) would injure thee flying up to heaven, them smite  
thou down with flame (*háras*), O Jātavedas, unfearing; ascend unto  
heaven, O sun, formidable, with radiance.

### Notes
By metrical evidence, *jātavedas* in **c** is an intrusion ⌊although  
obviously older than the Anukr.⌋, besides being at least superfluous in  
sense. The mss. read *bíbhyad ugro ‘rc-* (p. *bíbhyat: ugraḥ*) but SPP.  
emends to *ábibhyat: ugráḥ*, as we had done ⌊but neglects the necessary  
*abhinihita svarita*⌋; the comm. so understands the words. Ppp. reads  
*ugro arciṣā* in **d**.  
  
After this hymn, three of our mss. (P.M.W.) insert as next hymn,  
numbering it 66, the one-versed RV. i. 99, without variant.

A Golden Eagle thou hast soared with light to heaven. Those who would harm thee as thou fliest skyward. Beat down, O Jatavedas, with thy fury. The strong hath feared: to heaven mount up with light, O Surya.
