### Translation
10. Let those malignants who shall attack me from the upward quarter  
come upon Bṛihaspati with all the gods.

### Notes
Verse 8 is properly *bhurij* (23 syllables). Verses 9 and 10 are each  
properly of 27 syllables; but by restoring elided initial *a* here and  
there (with regard to which the Anukr. appears to acknowledge no rule)  
the meters as defined can be made out.

Let those who vex me from the zenith, sinners, extol Brihaspati with the Visve Devas.
