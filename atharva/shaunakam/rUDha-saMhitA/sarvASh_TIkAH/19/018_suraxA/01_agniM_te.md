### Translation
1. Let those malignants (*aghāyú*) who shall attack (*abhi-dās*) me from  
the eastern quarter come upon (*ṛch*) Agni with (*-vant*) the Vasus.

### Notes
The comm. has the more regular *vasumantam*. All the mss., and the  
comm., have at the end of all the verses *‘bhidā́sāt*, which SPP.  
accordingly retains; our edition makes the absolutely necessary  
emendation to *-sān*. ⌊Is *-dā́sāt* a faulty reminiscence of AV. v. 10?⌋  
Most of the saṁhitā-mss. also accent *diśó ‘bhi-*. Some of the mss.  
leave *té* unaccented. 'With' is represented throughout the hymn by  
*-vant* or *-mant*, not by the instrumental case. As usual, *ṛch*  
signifies a coming into hostile or detrimental contact or collision. ⌊W.  
interlines "run against" as alternative for "come upon."⌋

Let those who vex me from the eastern region, sinners, praise Agni followed by the Vasus.
