### Translation
1. Forth from the sky, from the earth, from the atmosphere, out of the  
forest trees, the herbs—whithersoever borne, O Jātavedas, come thou,  
enjoying, thence to us.

### Notes
The translation implies emendation to *jātavedas*, voc., in **c**. SPP.  
reads in **d** *táta stutó j-*, with nearly all the mss.; one or two  
read *tátas-tato j-*; ⌊this report coincides virtually with the *Index*,  
p. 124 b: but, if I understand the Collation Book, P. and M., which  
Whitney here intends, read *tátas tató j-*, which is neither one thing  
nor the other, but a confusion between the *āmreḍita* and *tátas +  
stutó;*⌋ and the comm. has *tatas-tataḥ*. The mss. also, almost without  
exception, give *bíbhṛtas* or *bíbhratas* in **c**; here SPP's text  
agrees with ours, and with the comm. Ppp. has for **b** *vātā paśubhyo  
ay oṣadhībhyaḥ*, evidently intending the text which TB. has in a  
corresponding verse (in i. 2. 1²²), *vā́tāt paśúbhyo ádhy óṣadhībhyaḥ*.  
For **c, d** TB. has *yátra-yatra jātavedaḥ sambabhū́va* ⌊so Calc. ed.,  
text, p. 32, comm., p. 91; but Poona ed. has aright *sambabhū́tha*, text  
and comm., p. 83⌋ *táto no agne juṣámāṇa é ‘hi;* Āp. (in v. 13. 4)  
agrees with TB. ⌊precisely: reading *sambabhūtha*⌋.
