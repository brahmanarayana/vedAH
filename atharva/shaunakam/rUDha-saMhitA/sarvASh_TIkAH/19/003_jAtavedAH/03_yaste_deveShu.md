### Translation
3. What thy heavenly (*svargá*) greatness is, among the gods, what body  
of thine entered into the Fathers, what prosperity of thine was spread  
among men (*manuṣyà*)—therewith, O Agni, assign wealth to us.

### Notes
The translation implies at end of **a** *svargás* ⌊so SPP.⌋; our text  
has *-gé* on the authority of only a single ms., and against the comm.  
⌊*svargaḥ*⌋ and the parallel texts ⌊*suvargáḥ*⌋ as found in TB. (in i.  
2. ²¹⁻²) and Āp. (in v. 13. 4). Both these read further, for **b**, *yás  
ta ātmā́ paśúṣu práviṣṭaḥ*, and, for **d**, *táyā no agne juṣámāṇa é  
‘hi;* while TB. has in **c** *prathé* for *paprathé* ⌊so Calc. ed., text  
and comm.: but Poona aright, *paprathé*⌋. The Anukr. takes no notice of  
the redundant syllable in **c**.

Thy majesty among the Gods in Svarga, thy body which hath past into the Fathers. Thy plenty far-diffused mid human beings, even with this, O Agni, give us riches.
