### Translation
3. In that, O Agni, we put on for thee any pieces of wood whatever, be  
all that propitious to me; enjoy thou that, O youngest one.

### Notes
The first two pādas and the fourth are RV. viii. 91 (or 102). 20, which  
reads *kā́ni kā́ni cid* in **a** ⌊and *tā́* for the *tád* of our **d**⌋.  
The Yajus-texts, VS. xi. 73, MS. (in ii. 7. 7), TS. (in iv. 1. 10¹), all  
have the inserted pāda **c**: VS. MS. end it with *te ghṛtám* instead of  
our *me śivám*, while TS. makes it read *tád astu túbhyam íd ghṛtám*.  
VS. reads **a** as does RV., but TS.MS. have *yā́ni kā́ni ca*. Nearly all  
the authorities have *dā́ruṇi* ⌊only W's P.M. have *dā́rūṇi*⌋; and all  
have *dadhmasi*, without accent: SPP. emends both words to accordance  
with RV., as we had done. Part of the mss. ⌊and the comm.⌋ have in **d**  
*yaviṣṭha*. The verse is used by Vāit. (28. 14) in the *agnicayana*  
ceremony. ⌊Cf. p. 898, line 1.⌋

Whatever even be the logs which, Agni, we lay down for thee, propitious be it all to me: accept it, O most youthful God.
