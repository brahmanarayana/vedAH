### Translation
1. O Agni, I have taken fuel for the great Jātavedas; let that Jātavedas  
extend to me both faith and wisdom.

### Notes
The whole verse is found in śGS. ii. 10, the only variant being *agnaye*  
at the beginning; ⌊Oldenberg's text (cf. his note, p. 139) should read  
*āhārṣam*, with his codex F.⌋; the first half-verse occurs in several  
other Sūtras (AGS. i. 21. 1; PCS. ii. 4. 3; HGS. i. 7. 2; MB. i. 6.  
32), with a very different latter half, but all reading *agnaye;* ⌊and  
we find *agnáye* at MP. ii. 6. 2; and again at GGS. ii. 10. 46, where  
the *pratīka* is cited⌋. The comm. also has *agnaye*, with one of SPP's  
reciters. The Atharvan reading is plainly *ágne*, apparently a metrical  
emendation, and the translation follows it, rather than our unnecessary  
conjecture, *ágre*. ⌊In this case, as the meter clearly shows, we must  
allow that the AV. has the better reading *ágne* as against the *agnaye*  
of a whole series of Sūtra-texts. Their inferior reading is of course  
not to be changed; but still less should the AV. be changed to *agnáye*,  
as Oldenberg, note to śGS., p. 139, overlooking the meter, suggests.⌋

For lofty Jatavedas I have brought the fuel hither first. May he who knoweth all bestow faith and intelligence on me.
