### Translation
3. We have come unto the road of the gods, to convey (*vah*) along  
forward what we may be able; Agni \[is\] knowing; he shall make  
offering; he verily is *hótar;* he shall arrange the sacrifices  
(*adhvará*), he the seasons.

### Notes
The verse is RV. x. 2. 3, and found also in TS. i. 1. 14³, MS. iv. 10.  
2, and śB. xii. 4. 4¹. These texts read in **c, d** *sé ’d u hótā só  
adhv-*, and all save śB. accent *ánu* in **b**. The comm's text also has  
the RV. reading *se ’d u hotā*. The verse, with the Atharvan readings in  
**c, d**, is found in full in Kāuś. 5. 12, in the *parvan*-ceremonies.  
In the same ceremonies it accompanies in Vāit. 3. 5 an offering to Agni  
*sviṣṭakṛt;* and again, in Vāit. 19. 12, an after-offering to various  
gods. ⌊As for the critical significance of the citation of the vs. in  
*sakalapāṭha*, see p. 897, ¶3.⌋

To the Gods' pathway have we come desiring to execute what work we may accomplish. Let Agni--for he knows--complete the worship. He is the Priest: let him fix rites and seasons.
