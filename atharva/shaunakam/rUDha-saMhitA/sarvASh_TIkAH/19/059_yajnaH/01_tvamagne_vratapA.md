### Translation
1. Thou, O Agni, art protector of vows among gods (?), among mortals;  
thou art to be praised at the sacrifices.

### Notes
The verse is RV. viii. 11. 1, and found also in VS. iv. 16; TS. i. 1.  
14⁴; 2. 3¹, and MS. i. 2. 3, everywhere without variant, except as the  
AV. mss. in general read in **b** *devā́ ā́ m-* ⌊three have *devā́ ām-*⌋;  
⌊Whitney's P. and M. and SPP's S^(m). and his D^(c)., p.m., have *devá ā́  
m-*;⌋ the *pada*-mss. give *devāḥ* (two of SPP's, after it,  
*ā॰mártyeṣu*). The RV. *pada*-text has *deváḥ;* ⌊so also TS.  
*pada*-text: see Weber's note in his ed., p. 13;⌋ the translation  
implies *devé*, in the sense of *devéṣu*. The comm. understands *devás*,  
and SPP. also reads it by emendation. ⌊Roth, *Ueber gewisse Kürzungen  
des Wortendes im Veda*, p. 3, treats the RV. verse, with report of the  
comm. on RV.VS.TS.: he assumes *devé: ā́* as *pada*-reading and  
understands *devé* as = *devéṣu*. Cf. *daśa* (= *daśabhis*) *dvādaśabhir  
vā ‘pi*, MBh. xii. 307 (or 306). 10 = xii. 11377, as cited by Hopkins,  
JAOS. xxiii. 111; cf. also English *inside and out* (*out* = *outside*);  
Goethe's *Jeden Nachklang fühlt inein Herz froh-* (= *froher*) *und  
trüber Zeit;* etc.⌋
