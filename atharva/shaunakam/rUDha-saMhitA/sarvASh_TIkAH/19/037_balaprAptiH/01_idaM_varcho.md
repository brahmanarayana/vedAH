### Translation
1. This splendor hath come, given by Agni, brightness (*bhárga*), glory,  
power, force, vigor (*vájas*), strength; and the heroisms that are  
thirty-three—those let Agni give forth to me.

### Notes
Most of the mss. accent *balám* at end of **b**. The first half-verse  
corresponds to a first half-verse in TB. (ii. 5. 7¹), MS. (ii. 3. 4),  
and AśS. (vi. 12. 2); all these read at end of **a** *ā́ ’gāt*, and AśS.  
has *rādhas* instead of *várcas;* then, in **b**, TB. and AśS. give  
*yáśo bhárgaḥ sáha ójo bálaṁ ca*, MS. *máhi rā́dhaḥ sáha ójo bálaṁ yát*,  
all making a good *triṣṭubh* pāda; the verse is too irregular to be  
called simply a triṣṭubh. ⌊With **c**, cf. 27. 10 **a**, above.⌋

To me hath come this word given by Agni, fame, force and might, and strength, and life, and lustre. May Agni too bestow on me three-times a hundred manly powers.
