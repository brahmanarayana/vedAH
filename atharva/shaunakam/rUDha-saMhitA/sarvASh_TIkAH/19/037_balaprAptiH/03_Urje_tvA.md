### Translation
3. Unto refreshment thee, unto strength thee, unto force, unto power  
thee, unto superiority thee do I carry about, unto the wearing of  
royalty for a hundred autumns.

### Notes
Very likely the last word is best rendered as a noun; the comm. so takes  
it. The mss. all accent *ráṣṭrābhṛt-*, which SPP. retains; our text  
makes the necessary emendation to *-ṭrabhṛ́t-* ⌊cf. *Gram.* §1213 c⌋.  
⌊Even though *3-p. mahābṛhatī* taken (*Ind. Stud.* viii. 243) as  
12:12:12,⌋ the definition of the Anukr. is bad: the verse is just as  
much an *āstārapan̄kti* as vs. 2; ⌊both are doubtless to be scanned as 8  
+ 8: 11 + 11⌋.

For conquering strength and energy and vigour I fasten thee for chieftainship, for bearing royal dominion through a hundred autumns.
