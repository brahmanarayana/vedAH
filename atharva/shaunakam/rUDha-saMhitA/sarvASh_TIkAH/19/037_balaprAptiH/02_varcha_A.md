### Translation
2. Splendor set thou in my body (*tanū́*), power, force, vigor, strength;  
unto Indra-like action, unto heroism, unto \[life\] of a hundred  
autumns, do I accept thee.

### Notes
The majority of mss. again accent *balám*. In **a**, SPP. has the better  
reading *tanvā̀m*, with the comm. and a single ms. (accidental i"). ⌊The  
transition-form ought probably to be oxytone, *tanvā́m:* see my  
*Noun-Inflection*, p. 412, near top.⌋ ⌊With our second half-verse cf.  
the second half of the verse just cited from TB.MS.AśS.: apart from two  
or three misprints, it reads *dīrghāyutvā́ya śatáśāradāya práti gṛhṇāmi*  
(MS. *gṛbhṇāmi*: AśS. *gṛbhnāmi*, cf. *Grammar* §195 a) *mahaté vīryàya*  
(MS. -tá indriyā́ya)—a confused blending of tags: cf . xi. 1. 3, 7, and  
so on.⌋ ⌊The comm. takes **a, b** as addressed to Agni.⌋ Under 2 **c,  
d** and vss. 3 and 4, he speaks of the thing addressed simply as a  
*padārtha*, 'a substance,' not presuming to define what it is: an  
unusual restraint on his part.
