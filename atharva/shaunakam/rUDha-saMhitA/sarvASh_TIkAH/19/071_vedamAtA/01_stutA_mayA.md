### Translation
1. Praised by me \[is\] the boon-giving Veda-mother. Let them urge on  
the soma-hymn of the twice-born. Having given to me life-time, breath,  
progeny, cattle, fame, property, Vedic splendor, go ye to the  
*brahma*-world.

### Notes
A corresponding verse is found in the supplement (p. 915 of the Calc.  
ed.) ⌊p. 855 of the Poona ed.⌋ to TA. x. 36, reading thus: *stuto mayā  
varadā vedamātā pracodayantī pavane dvijātā: āyuḥ pṛthivyāṁ draviṇam  
brahmavarcasam mahyaṁ datvā prajātum brahmalokam* (the accentuation is  
only partial, and worthless); its variants hardly help the  
interpretation of our verse. The translation given above makes no  
pretense to being an intelligent one; it merely endeavors to make what  
sense it can, with least divergence from the manuscript readings. For  
**a** it implies *stutā́ máyā varadā́ vedamātā́*, which agrees throughout  
with the mss., save that they accent *vedamātā* in several different  
ways; the *pada*-mss. give *varadā* without division. For **b** is  
implied *prá codayantām pāvamānī́ṁ dvijā́nām* (with our edition); the mss.  
accent *pracodáyantām;* and ⌊excepting W's P.M.W., which give  
*pāvamānī́m*⌋ they read *pāvamānī́*, which SPP. adopts. In the second  
division, SPP. reads *paśúm*, with ⌊about⌋ half the authorities, and  
with the comm.; the remaining authorities favor our *paśū́n*, giving that  
or *paśū́ṁ*. The comm. explains *varadā* by *iṣṭakāmapradātrī*, and  
*vedamātā* by *vedasya rgādirūpasya mātā*, signifying the *sāvitrī*, and  
standing as subject to *pra codayantām*, which is *pluralis  
majestaticus*, as is also *vrajata*. ⌊Weber discusses *varadā* and the  
TA. passage at *Ind. Stud.* ii. 194 (as Whitney notes in the margin),  
and resolves *stuto* into *stutā u*.⌋

Let my libations, giving boons, adoring, further the Twice-born's song that honours Soma. Go ye to Brahma's world having enriched me with life and breath, with children and with cattle, with fame and wealth, and with a Brahman's lustre.
