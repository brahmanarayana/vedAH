### Translation
4. Let the Ādityas, the Rudras, the Vasus enjoy this very new worship  
(*bráhman*) as it is performed; let there hear us them of the sky, them  
of the earth, also the kine-born, who are worshipful.

### Notes
The RV. version ⌊vs. 14⌋ reads at end of **a** *juṣanta*. The comm.  
explains *gojātās* as the Maruts, born of Pṛśni.

So may the Rudras, Vasus, and Adityas accept the new hymn we now are making. May all the Holy Ones of earth and heaven, and the Cow's off- spring hear our invocation.
