### Translation
2. Weal for us be the gods, the all-gods; weal be Sarasvatī with the  
prayers (*dhī́*); weal the followers (? *abhiṣác*) and weal the  
gift-following (*rātiṣác*); weal for us they of the sky, they of the  
earth, weal for us they of the waters.

### Notes
This verse is found, without variant, also in TB. ii. 8. 6³ and MS. iv.  
14. 11. The comm. declares *devā́ viśvádevās* to mean *bahustotrakā  
indrādayaḥ; abhiṣā́cas, yajñam abhitaḥ samavayanto devāḥ;* and  
*rātiṣā́cas*, *dānārthaṁ saṁgacchamānā devāḥ*—these two epithets  
belonging to the *viśve devāḥ*. Ppp. reads at the end *āpyāḥ*.

Kind to us be the Gods and Visve Devas, Sarasvati with Holy Thoughts be gracious. Friendly be they, the Liberal Ones, who seek us, yea, those who dwell in-heaven, on earth, in waters.
