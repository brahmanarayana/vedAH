### Comment
The hymn is found also in Pāipp. xix. (the order of vss. 2 and 3 being inverted). It resembles i. 15, and, as it has the same pratīka of the first verse, the comm. maintains that it may be used along with or instead of that hymn where the latter is quoted (Kāuś. 19. 4, and Nakṣ. K. 20). ⌊C.f. also note to Kāuś. 19. 1.⌋


### Translations
Translated: Griffith, ii. 259.
