### Translation
6. When, O well-portioned night, thou comest today, sharing out what is  
good, \[then\] make us to enjoy that, that it go not away.

### Notes
The translation follows our text, which is very different from that of  
the mss. and SPP. Our *adyā́* in **a** implies *adyá ā́* (*ā́...áyas*),  
which all the *pada*-mss. have, while SPP., with the comm., treats it as  
only *adyá* with the final lengthened by the usual Vedic license. In  
**b** all the mss. accent *ví bhajanti* ⌊p. *ví: bhajanti*⌋; SPP. emends  
to *vi-bhájanti*, while our text means *vibhájantī*. The comm.  
understands *-nti* ⌊supplying *śatravas* as subject⌋, and takes *áyas*  
after it as the noun, 'metal' (*ayomayaṁ vastu*); to us *áyas* is verb.  
⌊Ppp. has *vasuḥ* at end of **b**.⌋ In **c** the mss., the comm., and  
SPP., begin with *yád;* we have emended it to *tád*. For **d**, most  
mss. have *yáthe ’dáṁ nā́ ’nupāyási* (p. *anu॰pāyási*); but one *-yáti*,  
one *-dányā́nu-*; SPP. follows the comm. and prints *yáthé ’d anyā́n  
upā́yasi* (p. *upa॰áyasi*), but in a note conjectures *yáthé ’d anyā́n nó  
’pā́yati* 'that it go not unto others,' which is very acceptable, as  
giving a good sense with less alteration of the original text than our  
version requires. Ppp. is wholly corrupt: *yathed yasmā nitājaya yathed  
anyān upāyatī;* but the last pāda favors SPP's conjecture.
