### Translation
4. As the millet-seed, flying forth, blowing away, is not found, so, O  
night, make him fly forth who is malicious against us.

### Notes
The mss. read in **a** mostly *śāmyā́kas* (so the comm. and SPP.), also  
*śyāmyā́kas* and *śyāmā́kas;* and have *prapátan* or *prápatan*, with  
other chance variations; and in **b**, *apavā́n* (p. *apa॰vā́n*) or  
*-vā́ṁ;* in respect to this word, the translation ⌊taking it as present  
participle of *apa-vā*⌋ follows them rather than our emendation  
*aparám*. None of the mss. accent *na*, but SPP. ventures ⌊with the  
Berlin ed.⌋ to emend the reading. At the beginning of **c**, the mss.  
all have *etā́v ā́* ⌊several *ā*⌋ (p. *etāú: ā́*); the comm. and SPP. (also  
Ppp.) agree with our *evā́*. The majority of mss. have at the end  
*-yánti*. Ppp. has in **a, b** *sānyākaṣ prapatante divāṁ nā ’nu-*; in  
**d** it combines *yo ‘smāṅ*.

As millet hurried through the air before us is beheld no more. So cause the man to vanish, Night, who plans to do us injury.
