### Translation
4. Do thou, knowing, lead us toward broad space (*loká*), light that is  
heavenly (*svàr*), fearlessness, well-being; may we dwell under the  
formidable arms of thee the stout one, O Indra, \[those two\] great  
refuges.

### Notes
The verse is RV. vi. 47. 8, found also in TB. (in ii. 7. 133); both  
these texts read in **b** *svàrvaj jy-*, at beginning of **c** *ṛṣvā́*,  
and in **d** *stheyāma*. The comm. gives *svaryat*, but explains the  
*-yat* as *-gacchat* (as above, 13. 1); Ppp. agrees with RV.TB. ⌊in  
reading *svàrvaj*⌋; ⌊Ppp. abbreviates the consonant group *-j jy-* to  
*-jy-*; and so does TB., ed. Calc, reading *súvarva jy-*⌋. In **d**, the  
comm. has the better reading *kṣiyema*.

Lead us to ample room. O thou who knowest, to happiness security, and sunlight. Strong, Indra, are the arms of thee the mighty: may we betake us to their lofty shelter.
