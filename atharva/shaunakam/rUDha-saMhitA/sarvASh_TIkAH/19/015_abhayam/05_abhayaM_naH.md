### Translation
5. May the atmosphere make for us fearlessness; fearlessness both  
heaven-and-earth here; fearlessness from behind, fearlessness from in  
front; from above, from below be there fearlessness for us.

### Notes
The comm. prefers to take the words of direction in **c, d** in their  
other admissible sense of points of compass, pointing out that *adhara*  
gets the value 'south' by antithesis to *uttara* 'north.' The verse (11  
+ 12: 11 + 11 \[?\] = 45) is no sort of a *jagatī*.

May air's mid-region give us peace and safety, safety may both these, Heaven and Earth, afford us. Security be ours from west, from eastward, from north and south may we be free from danger.
