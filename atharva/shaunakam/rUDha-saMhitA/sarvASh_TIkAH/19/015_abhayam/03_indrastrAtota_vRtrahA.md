### Translation
3. Indra \[is\] rescuer and Vṛitra-slayer, our desirable far-and-wide  
protector (?); be he our defender at the extremities, he in the middle,  
he behind, he in front.

### Notes
In **b** the translation follows the comm., who explains *paraspā*  
(*-pāḥ*) *no v-*; all the mss. (save one or two s.m.)\* have *parasphā́no  
v-* (p. *parasphā́naḥ*, without division), and this is doubtless the true  
Atharvan text, though an unintelligible corruption, of which our  
*gayasphāna* is an only partially successful emendation. \*⌊In fact, W's  
O. and three of SPP's mss. have *-sphā-*, p.m., and *-spā-*, s.m.; and  
SPP's reciter K. gave *-sphā-*, while his reciter V. gave *-spā-*.⌋ Ppp-  
reads *parampāno* (*paraspā no?*). The *pada*-mss. unintelligently  
divide *ca: ramatáḥ* in **c**; some of our mss. have *-matá sá*. The  
verse (8 + 8: 12 + 10 = 38) is poorly described by the Anukr.

Best, making household wealth increase. Indra our saviour, kills the foe. May he from outmost point be our potector, and from the centre and from west and eastward.
