### Translation
14. From that all-sacrificing sacrifice was collected the speckled  
butter (*pṛṣadājyá*); it made those cattle belonging to Vāyu—those that  
are of the forest and of the village.

### Notes
That is, the wild and the tame. ⌊The verse is RV. x. 90. 8; VS. xxxi. 6;  
TA. iii. 12. 4.⌋ RV. alone combines in **c** *paśū́n tā́-*; in **d**, RV.  
and TA. read *āraṇyā́n*. SPP. unaccountably accents at end of **b**  
*pṛṣadājyàm*, against the majority of his mss., all of ours, and the  
usage everywhere else. The mss. vary between *vāyavyā́n* and *vāyavyā̀n*.  
Ppp. has in **c** *cakrire;* ⌊and so has KaṭhaB.⌋.

From that great general sacrifice the dripping fat was gathered up: It formed the creatures fleet as wind, and animals both wild and tame.
