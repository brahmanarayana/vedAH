### Translation
11. They sprinkled with the early rain (*prāvṛ́ṣ*) that sacrifice,  
Purusha, born in the beginning; therewith the gods sacrificed, the  
Perfectibles (*sādhyá*) and they that are Vasus.

### Notes
⌊RV. x. 90. 7; VS. xxxi. 9; TA. iii. 12. 3.⌋ The other three texts agree  
in reading in **a** *barhíṣi* (for *prāvṛ́ṣā*), in **b** *agratás*, in  
**d** *ṛ́ṣayas* (for *vásavas*). Ppp. has in **d** *sādhyā ca*. One or  
two of our mss. give *agratás* (like RV. etc.); about half SPP's  
authorities accent *áyajanta* ⌊as does also TA.⌋.
