### Translation
16. Seven times seventy rays (*aṅśú*) were born from the head of the  
great god, of king Soma, when born out of Purusha.

### Notes
This verse is found nowhere else. The RV. has also a 16th verse, an  
appendage to the hymn in a different meter, which was earlier found as  
RV. i. 164. 50, and is our vii. 5. 1, besides occurring in a number of  
other texts—in VS. ⌊xxxi. 16⌋ and TA. ⌊iii. 12. 7⌋, in connection with  
the rest of the Purusha-hymn. The comm. refers to the double character  
of soma, as plant and as moon, and notes that, while the sun's rays are  
a thousand, those of the moon are four hundred and ninety.
