### Translation
7. The moon \[is\] born from his mind; from his eye the sun was born;  
from his mouth both Indra and Agni; from his breath Vāyu was born.

### Notes
⌊RV. x. 90. 13; VS. xxxi. 12; TA. iii. 12. 6.⌋ RV.TA. have no variant  
from our text; VS. reads for the second line *śrótrād vāyúś ca prāṇáś ca  
múkhād agnír ajāyata*. ⌊KaṭhaB. has for **b** the much better *cákṣuṣor  
ádhi sū́ryaḥ* (avoiding the undesirable *cákṣos:* see *Noun-Inflection*,  
p. 569 top, p. 410 top); and in **c, d** it agrees with VS., except that  
it substitutes *násor* for *śrótrad*.⌋
