### Translation
1. Thousand-armed is Purusha, thousand-eyed, thousand-footed; he,  
covering the earth entirely, exceeded it by ten fingers' breadth.

### Notes
⌊The verse is RV. x. 90. 1; VS. xxxi. 1; SV. i. 618; TA. iii. 12. 1.⌋  
All the other texts begin with *sahásraśīrṣā* (SV. *-rṣāḥ*); SV.VS.  
⌊KaṭhaB.⌋ have in **c** *sarvátas*, and VS. after it *spṛtvā́;* ⌊von  
Schroeder reports the KaṭhaB. reading as *smṛtvā́:* but perhaps the  
intention of his mss. is rather *spṛtvā́*⌋. The comm. gives very long  
expositions of most of the verses, but casts no light upon them.  
⌊Deussen, p. 150, calls the substitution of *-bāhuḥ* for *-śīrṣā* a  
"rationalizing variant: because, if Purusha has 1000 eyes, he ought to  
have only 500 heads"! But even the AV. comm. glosses *sahasrākṣaḥ* by  
*bahubhir akṣibhir upetaḥ*.⌋

Purusha hath a thousand arms, a thousand eyes, a thousand feet. On every side pervading earth he fills a space ten fingers wide.
