### Translation
8. From his navel was the atmosphere; from his head the sky came into  
being (*sam-vṛt*); from his (two) feet the earth, the quarters from his  
ear (*śrótra*): so shaped they the worlds.

### Notes
⌊RV. x. 90. 14; VS. xxxi. 13; TA. iii. 12. 6.⌋ The three other texts  
agree with ours throughout.

Forth from his navel come mid-air; the sky was fashioned from his head. Earth from his feet, and from his ear the regions. Thus they formed the worlds.
