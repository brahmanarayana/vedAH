### Translation
13. From that all-sacrificing sacrifice were born the verses (*ṛ́c*), the  
chants (*sā́man*); meter ⌊sic!⌋ were born from that; sacrificial formula  
was born from that.

### Notes
⌊RV. x. 90. 9; VS. xxxi. 7; TA. iii. 12. 4.⌋ The other texts have at  
beginning of **c** *chándāṅsi*, and our edition gives the same; but the  
mss., except one of ours p. m. and two of SPP's, read instead *chándo  
ha*, and SPP. follows them; this, though an ungrammatical corruption (as  
shown in the translation), has the best right to figure as Atharvan  
text.  
  
⌊See p. xcvii.⌋
