### Translation
2. Let them of the series of twenty-eight, propitious, helpful, together  
allot to me acquisition (*yóga*); I go forward to acquisition and  
possession (*kṣéma*); I go forward to possession and acquisition; homage  
be to day-and-night.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
In **b**, the comm. reads *sahá yógam* as a compound, *sahayogam*. He  
explains, after the usual fashion, *yoga* as *alabdhavastuprāpti* (his  
ms., *alabhya-*), and kṣema as *labdhavastuparipālana*, and the  
translation follows him. The verse (11 + 8: 8 + 8 + 8 = 43) is quite  
improperly let pass as simply a *triṣṭubh*. ⌊As, for the twenty-eight,  
see introduction to hymn 7.⌋

Propitious, mighty, let the eight-and-twenty together deal me out my share of profit. Profit and wealth be mine, and wealth and profit! To Day and Night be adoration rendered!
