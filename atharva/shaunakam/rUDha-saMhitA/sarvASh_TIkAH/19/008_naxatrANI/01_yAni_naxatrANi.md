### Translation
1. What asterisms are in the sky, in the atmosphere, in the waters, on  
the earth, what ones in the mountains, in the quarters, what ones the  
moon goes on preparing (*pra-kḷp*), let all those be propitious to me.

### Notes
The mss., and so SPP., have the incorrect accent *prákalpayan* in **c**;  
it is emended in our text. It is possible, but not natural, to count in  
the verse 46 syllables, with the Anukr.

Benign to me be all those Lunar Mansions to which the Moon as he moves on doth honour. All that are in the sky, the air, the waters, on earth, on moun- tains, in the heavenly regions.
