### Translation
6. These (fem.), O Brahmaṇaspati, that go dispersing upon the wind—do  
thou, O Indra, making them come together, make them most propitious for  
me.

### Notes
The *pada*-mss. give in **b** *vā́taḥ* instead of *vā́te*, which latter is  
evidently the true reading. The comm. also understands *vātas*, which  
compels him to take *īrate* as = *īrte*, and to translate it as if  
causative. The comm. understands the quarters (*diśas*) as intended, and  
points it out as well-known that in a violent wind these are confounded,  
one of them being taken for another. This is hardly better than silly;  
but what is really the subject of the verse is very hard to see. The  
Anukr. omits any definition of these three *anuṣṭubh* verses\*; and,  
what is much more strange, although it describes the hymn as of seven  
verses, and the mss. and the comm. so number, it combines 6 and 7  
together into one verse as 8 + 8: 8 + 8: 11 + 9 = 52. ⌊Ppp. has, for  
**b**, *viṣūcer vāca īyate*, and at end of **d** *-tamaṣ kṛdhi*. \*⌊No:  
see p. 912, line 9.⌋

These flames of Brahmanaspati borne to all quarters in the- wind, Turn them all hither, Indra, and make them most gracious unto, me.
