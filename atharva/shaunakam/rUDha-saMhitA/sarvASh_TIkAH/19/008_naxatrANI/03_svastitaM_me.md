### Translation
3. Be it for me well at sunset (?), well in early morning, well at  
evening, well by day; be it for me well with beasts, well with birds;  
with easy invocation, O Agni, having gone with well-being to a mortal,  
come thou again enjoying.

### Notes
In **a** the translation follows our conjectural emendation of  
*svástitam* (or *svastí tám*, or *svastítam*, as some of the mss.  
variously read; the *pada*-mss. have *svastí: tám* or *svástitam;* ⌊one.  
ms. and two śrotriyas of SPP. and⌋ the comm. give *svastí tát*) to  
*svastamitám*, which is bold, but not implausible. For *sudivám* the  
comm. has the better supported *sudinam*. The mss. ⌊except D. and L.,  
which read *suśakunám*⌋ and SPP. accent *suśakúnam*, which may be  
correct. The translation of the second half-verse is only a makeshift;  
the line appears to be thoroughly corrupt; implied is the reading  
*svastyā́ mártyaṁ gatvā́;* SPP. reads, with nearly all the mss., *svasty  
àmártyaṁ gatvā́*, against the proper accent *ámartyam*. SPP's *pada*-mss.  
read at the end *ā́ya: abhi॰nándan* (one has *ā́yā*); both our mss. are  
imperfect, one reading simply *ā́*, the other perhaps *ā́yā* with the *y*  
erased; if the word is to be accepted at all, it should apparently be  
*ā́: aya*. The repetition of *martya* in our text is doubtless too  
daring, considering how unsatisfactory a result it yields after all.
