### Translation
1. Whither the *brahman*-knowers go, along with consecration, with  
ardor—thither let Agni conduct me; let Agni impart (*dhā*) to me wisdom:  
to Agni hail!

### Notes
SPP. strangely prefers to read *medhā́ da-* in **d**, with a mere  
majority of his authorities, but with the comm. ⌊who gives *medhās*⌋;  
our mss. also are divided between *-dhā́* and *-dhā́ṁ*. In the  
*pada*-text, SPP. emends to *-dhā́ḥ;* the *pada*-mss. have *-dhā́* or  
*-dhā́m*.

Whither men versed in Brahma go, with fervour and the cleans- ing rite, Thither let Agni lead me, let Agni give me intelligence, All hail to Agni!
