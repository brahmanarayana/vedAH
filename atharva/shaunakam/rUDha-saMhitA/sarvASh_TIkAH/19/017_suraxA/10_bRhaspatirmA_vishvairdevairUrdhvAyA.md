### Translation
10. Let Bṛihaspati with all the gods protect me from the upward quarter:  
in him I etc. etc.

### Notes
The comm. calls these prose "verses" and those of the next hymn  
*paryāyas;* and the metrical definitions of the Anukr. are of course  
worthless, although it is possible to read out something like the  
numbers of syllables required by that treatise.

Brihaspati, joined by the Visvedevas, protect me from the region of the zenith! To him, I go, in him I rest; this fort I seek for refuge. May he protect me, may he be my guardian. I give my soul-- All hail!--into his keeping.
