### Translation
8. Let Indra with (*-vant*) the Maruts protect me from that quarter: in  
him I etc. etc.

### Notes
The comm. quotes Bhagavad-Gītā x. 6 (rather futilely) to support the  
association of the seven seers with Viśvakarman as highest self  
(*paramātman*), and (most superfluously) RV. viii. 85 (96). 7 and AB.  
iii. 20. 1 (part) to show that Indra and the Maruts go together.
