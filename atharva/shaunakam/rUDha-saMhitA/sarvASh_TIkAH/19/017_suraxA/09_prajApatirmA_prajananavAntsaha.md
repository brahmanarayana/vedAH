### Translation
9. Let Prajāpati, possessing generative powers (*prajánanavant*),  
together with firm support (*pratiṣṭhā́*), protect me from the fixed  
quarter: in him I etc. etc.

### Notes
Many of the mss. give various other accents to *prajánanavān;* all read  
*pratiṣṭhā́yā* (p. *॰sthā́yāḥ*), which SPP. accordingly retains,\*  
although it is a palpable corruption; the comm. makes no difficulty of  
it, viewing it simply as a case of the substitution of genitive for  
instrumental; he adds, however, another interpretation, supplying  
*prajananena* for *sahá* to govern, and making *pratiṣṭhā́yās* an  
adjective qualifying *diśás*. \*⌊W's B. and all of SPP's authorities  
appear to accent *pratíṣṭāyā*, p. *pratí॰sthāyāḥ*, and this is in fact  
the accentuation and reading in SPP's text, although I do not see what  
is to be made of it.⌋
