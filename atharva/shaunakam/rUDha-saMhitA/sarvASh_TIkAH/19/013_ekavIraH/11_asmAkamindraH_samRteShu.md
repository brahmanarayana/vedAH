### Translation
11. Indra \[is\] ours when the banners meet \[in conflict\]; let the  
arrows that are ours conquer; let our heroes be superior; us, O gods,  
aid ye at the invocations.

### Notes
All the other texts read in **d** *asmā́ṅ u devās;* and MS. has the  
peculiar ending *bháreṣv ā́*. The verse is vs. 11 of the RV. hymn, RV.  
vs. 10 being omitted in the Atharvan (save as it is found in part as  
iii. 19. 6); RV. vs. 10 is omitted also by MS., which ends its hymn with  
11; in TS., RV. vs. 10 is put after 11, and 13 follows, only 12 being  
omitted; in the Atharvan, RV. vs. 12 occurs as iii. 2. 5, and 13 in part  
at iii. 19. 7.
