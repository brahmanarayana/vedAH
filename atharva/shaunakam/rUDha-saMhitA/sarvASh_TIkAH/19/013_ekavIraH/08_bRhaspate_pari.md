### Translation
8. O Bṛihaspati, fly about with thy chariot, demon-slaying, forcing away  
our enemies; breaking up our foes, slaughtering our enemies, be thou the  
helper of ourselves.

### Notes
Or, 'of our bodies (*tanū́*).' This verse corresponds to vs. 4 of all the  
other texts; and they read in concert for **c** *prabhañjánt sénāḥ  
pramṛṇó yudhā́ jáyann*, and at the end *ráthānām*. The *pada*-mss. commit  
the blunder of reading *mítrān* ⌊or *mitrā́n*⌋ in **b**; SPP. emends to  
*amítrān*, which the comm. also gives. A number of SPP's *saṁhitā*-mss.  
have (after the fashion of MS.) *-mitráṅ* or *-mítraṅ;* ⌊cf. note to 27.  
4, below⌋.
