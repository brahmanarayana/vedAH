### Translation
9. Indra \[be\] their leader; let Bṛihaspati, the sacrificial gift, the  
sacrifice, soma, go in front; in the midst of the smashing conquering  
armies of the gods let the Maruts go.

### Notes
⌊RV. vs. 8⌋ The text of MS. agrees throughout with ours; the others read  
*āsām* in **a**, and *ágram* (for *mádhye*) in **d** ⌊but TS. *ágre*⌋.  
The comm. does here a thing which is hardly paralleled elsewhere in his  
work: he points out that some explain *dakṣiṇā* in **b** as meaning "on  
the south," but that, as the word would in that case have to be accented  
*dakṣiṇā́*, as shown by xviii. 1.42, it must signify here rather  
'sacrificial gift' (*yajñe dīyamānā gorūpā dakṣiṇā*). A like attention  
to the element of accent elsewhere would notably improve the character  
of his lucubrations. ⌊Cf. note to vs. 4.⌋

Indra guide these! Brihaspati, the Guerdon, and Soma, and the Sacrifice precede them! And let the banded Maruts march in forefront of heavenly hosts that conquer and demolish.
