### Translation
4. He with the arrow-armed, he with the quiver-hung, \[is\] controller;  
he, Indra with his train, brings together the fighters—\[he,\]  
conquering those brought together, soma-drinker, defiant with his arms,  
of formidable bow, shooting with fitted \[arrows\].

### Notes
⌊Vs. 3 in RV.⌋ TS.MS. read in **d** *ūrdhvádhanvā;* and MS. has a very  
different **b**, *sáṁsṛṣṭāsu yutsv índro gaṇéṣu*. Many of the mss. (as  
often in such words) read in **b** *sáṁsṛṣṭā;* some (as also elsewhere)  
lengthen the *u* in *kampa* at beginning of **d**; all have at the end  
*ástāt*—which, however, even SPP. emends to *ástā*, with the comm. The  
*pada*-text give in **c** *soma॰pā́* (RV. *-pā́ḥ*). ⌊The comm. notes as an  
alternative that *yudhas* in **b** (both ed's, *yúdhas*) may be taken as  
*yudhás*, oxytone and abl. sing, (he cites Pāṇini, vi. 1. 168)—which is  
a regard for the accent (cf. note to vs. 9) that is unusual with him.⌋  
⌊For *prátihitā* used pregnantly of an arrow, cf. the citations under  
vi. 65. 1.⌋
