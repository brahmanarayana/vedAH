### Translation
5. Embryo of the river art thou, flower of the lightnings; the wind  
\[thy\] breath, the sun \[thine\] eye, from the sky \[thy\] milk.

### Notes
⌊Prose.⌋ SPP. and the comm. read *púṣpam*, and all the mss. probably are  
to be regarded as having it; *ṣpa* and *ṣya* are practically  
indistinguishable in the mss. Ppp. also gives *puṣpam*. At the beginning  
all the mss. have *síndho* (p. *síndho íti*); even SPP. emends to  
*síndhos*, the comm. giving it. The comm. curiously explains *vidyutām  
puṣpam* by *vṛṣṭyudakam:* one can hardly help suspecting a misreading.  
The Anukr. scans the "verse" (restoring the *a* of *asi*) as 6 + 5: 12 =  
23; its definition is far from acceptable. ⌊Bloomfield discusses the  
vs., AJP. xvii. 405.⌋
