### Translation
2. What the jaundice is, the *jāyā́nya*, the limb-splitter, the  
*visálpaka*—all *yákṣma* from thy limbs let the ointment expel  
(*nir-han*) out.

### Notes
The mss. make very bad work with the last pāda, nearly all (the  
variations are of no account) giving *barhír nírahantv* (p. *barhíḥ:  
níḥ: ahantu*); SPP. makes the same emendation that we had made; and ⌊it  
is confirmed by⌋ Ppp. and the comm., ⌊which⌋ have the same. ⌊Three or  
four of SPP's authorities, including two reciters, gave *bahís*.⌋ In  
**a**, the comm. strangely reads and explains *jyāyān yaḥ;* Ppp.  
presents *jāyāṁyo*. For *visalpakas* (which SPP. reads here also, as in  
vi. 127 and ix. 8), the comm. gives *visarpakas*, explaining it as  
*vividhaṁ saraṇaśīlo vraṇaviśeṣaḥ;* Ppp. has *viśalyakas*.
