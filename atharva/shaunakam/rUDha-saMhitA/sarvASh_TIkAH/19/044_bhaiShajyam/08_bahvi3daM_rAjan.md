### Translation
8. Much untruth, O king Varuṇa, doth man (*pū́ruṣa*) say here; from that  
sin (*áṅhas*) do thou free us, O thou of thousand-fold heroism.

### Notes
The mss. vary between *rā́jan* and *rājan*, and between *ánṛtam*,  
*anṛ́tam*, and *ánṛ́tam*. The great majority accent at the end  
*páryaṅhasaḥ*, and all the *pada*-mss. have *pári॰aṅhasaḥ*. SPP. reads  
at the beginning *bahv ī̀dám*, after the manner of the Sāma-Veda; we  
emended to *ìdám*, because that is the Atharvan practice (cf. note to  
Prāt. iii. 65, p. 499), against which the concurrence even of all the  
mss. ⌊save W's I.⌋, as here, ought not to count. Ppp. reads in **b**  
*puruṣaḥ*.

Full many a falsehood, O thou King Varuna, man hath uttered here: Do thou who hast a thousand powers preserve us from that misery.
