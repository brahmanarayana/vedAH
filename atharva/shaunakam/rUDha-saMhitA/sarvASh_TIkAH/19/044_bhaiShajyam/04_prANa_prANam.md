### Translation
4. O breath, rescue thou breath; O life-breath (*ásu*), be gracious to  
life-breath; O destruction, free us from the fetters of destruction.

### Notes
⌊Prose.⌋ The comm. follows a different division in verses 4-7, making of  
them but three verses,\* and of the whole hymn but nine. The method of  
the mss. and the Anukr. is plainly decidedly preferable; it is followed  
also by SPP. One does not see any justification for the division by the  
Anukr. of the last five words of this verse into two pādas, with five  
syllables (*śan̄ku-*) in the closing one. ⌊It counts 7 + 7: 7 + 5.⌋ Ppp.  
reads *trāyasva aso ‘save*. The comm. has *mām* instead of *nas*. About  
half the authorities give at the beginning *prā́ṇas*. ⌊For the citation  
of the vs. by Kāuś., see introd. to this hymn, and cf. especially p.  
897, ¶3.⌋ \*⌊Our 4,5**ab** = his 4; our 5**cd**, 6**ab** = his 5; our  
6**cd**,7 = his 6.⌋

Preserve our breath, O Vital Breath, have mercy on our life, O Life. From snares of Nirriti do thou, O Nirriti, deliver us.
