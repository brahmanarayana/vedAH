### Translation
3. Obstruct, O *darbhá*, my rivals; obstruct those etc. etc.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The comm. glosses the verb (after the *dhātupāṭha*) with *āvṛṇu nirodhaṁ  
kuru*. The Pet. Lex. ⌊s.v. 3 *ru* 'zerschlagen'⌋ suggests reading  
instead *rudhí* "according to mss."; but *rudhí* is found in only one  
ms., in **a**, while the same ms. has *rundhí* in **b, c, d**; *rudhí*  
is accordingly only a careless misreading. Ppp. has *bhaṅkti*.
