### Comment
⌊Partly prose—verses 2, 3, 4, and 6.⌋ Pāipp. has only the first verse (in ii.). The comm. quotes from a Pariśiṣṭa (SPP. is unable to identify the passage) a direction for using it (with vi. 45, 46) to a king who sees bad dreams. ⌊As to the connection of the material of this hymn with that of h. 56, see introd. to h. 56.⌋ ⌊As to the differences of division, see under vss. 3, 4, and 5, and cf. SPP's Critical Notice, vol. i., p. 24.⌋


### Translations
Translated: Ludwig, p. 468; Griffith, ii. 314.
