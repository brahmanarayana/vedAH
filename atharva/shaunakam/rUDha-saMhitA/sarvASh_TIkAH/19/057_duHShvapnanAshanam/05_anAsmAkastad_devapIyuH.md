### Translation
5. What evil-dreaming is in us, what in our kine, and what in our house,  
that let him who is not of us, the god-reviler, the mocker, put on like  
a necklace (*niṣká*).

6. Having measured off nine cubits, forth from that do we divide off to him who hates us all our evil-dreaming.


### Notes
⌊Pādas **a** and **b** are identical with 45. 2 **a, b**, above; and the  
rest of the verse seems to throw much light on 45. 2 **c, d**: see my  
note to that verse. In his Collation-Book, Whitney here made a note of  
this important parallel, but seems to have overlooked his note when  
working out his commentary.⌋ The mss. again all read *pípārus* ⌊P.M.:  
*píy-*⌋; and the comm. again *avā ’smākam*, supplying a *gamaya* to the  
*ava* in his explanation. The omission of *devapīyús* would make a fair  
*anuṣṭubh* of this verse ⌊and a faultless one, if we pronounce  
*niṣkéva*⌋; it is evidently metrical, and a verse by itself ⌊cf. 45. 2⌋  
as it stands in our text; the Anukr. and SPP., with part of the mss.,  
end vs. 4 with *gṛhé*, and throw all the rest of the hymn together as  
vs. 5; the comm. agrees with us as to vss. 5 and 6. ⌊The Anukr. seems to  
intend to count its verse 5 (*anāsmākás tád* to end of hymn) as 12 + 9:  
9 + 7 \[:\] 14 = 51, and to put its second *avasāna*, with some of the  
mss., after *pári*, as does SPP.⌋

⌊Prose.⌋ Instead of our _apamā́ya_, the mss., the comm., and SPP. read _ápamayā_ (p. _ápa॰mayāḥ_) how the comm. (or SPP.) would explain it does not appear, as he gives only the general sense of the expression; _asmākaṁ sambandhi duṣvapnyaṁ navāratniparyantam apasāraya_. He reads at the end _apriye saṁ nayāmasi_ (= 1 **d**).

The evil dream that threatens us, threatens our cattle or our home. That let the scorner of the Gods, the alien mischief-maker bind as a gold jewel round his neck.
