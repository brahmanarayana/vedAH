### Translation
1. As a sixteenth, as an eighth, as a \[whole\] debt they bring  
together, so do we bring together all evil-dreaming on one who is  
offensive (*ápriya*).

### Notes
The verse is nearly identical with vi. 46. 3, differing only by  
substituting *ápriye* in **d** for *dviṣaté*. *Apriye* comes near to the  
*āptyé* of RV. viii. 47. 17, with which both verses correspond: see note  
to vi. 46. 3. The comm., in fact, reads *āptye*.

As men discharge the utmost debt, collect the eighth and sixteenth part, So to the foeman we transfer together all the evil dream.
