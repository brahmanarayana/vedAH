### Translation
2. Let breath call unto us; we call unto breath; the earth, the  
atmosphere hath seized (*grah*) splendor; splendor \[also\] Soma,  
Bṛihaspati, the maintainer.

### Notes
Some mss. (including most of the *pada*-mss.) begin **b** with *úpa  
hvayám*. In **c**, one of SPP's mss. and Ppp. combine *pṛthivy ānt-*. At  
the end, the *pada*-mss. have correctly *dhartā́;* the *saṁhitā*-mss.  
vary between this and *dhattā́, dhattā́m,* and *dhattā́t;* and the reciter  
K. gave *vidhartā́*. The comm's text (SPP.) has *vidhattām*, but his  
explanation reads *vidhattā* (misreading for *-arttā?*) *viśeṣeṇa dhartā  
’gniḥ sūryo vā;* and SPP. most strangely adopts the senseless *vidhattā́*  
(it is read also by one ms.). Ppp. gives instead *bibhartu*, which is  
not bad. Furthermore, Ppp. begins **a** with **apa**, but **b** with  
*upa*. The seizing of splendor by these various divinities is, according  
to the comm., for the purpose of giving it to us. Pādas **b** and **d**  
lack each a syllable. ⌊A similar antithesis with *upahū* occurred at i.  
1. 4, and others were pointed out there.⌋

Let lively breath invite us: we call vital breath to visit us. Earth and air's middle realm have gathered, Soma, Brihaspati and Dhartar gathered vigour.
