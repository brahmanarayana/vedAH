### Translation
3. Heaven-and-earth have become joint-seizers of splendor; seizing  
splendor may we go about upon the earth; with glory the kine, coming,  
wait upon (*upa-sthā*) the lord of kine; seizing glory may we go about  
upon the earth.

### Notes
⌊The verse is by no means one of 4 pādas, but rather one of 6 (**a-f**:  
so designated below): in fact, it is a regular *anuṣṭubh*, to each half  
of which is added in prose an *ūha*-refrain (*varco* etc., *yaśo* etc.)  
of 14 syllables.⌋ The mss. read in **b** *babhūváthus*, accenting also  
*dyā́vāpṛthivī́;* the translation implies the simpler and more probable  
emendation to *-vatus;* ⌊and of course the retention of the  
ms.-accentuation of *dyā́vāpṛthivī́:* correct the Berlin ed. accordingly;⌋  
SPP. leaves both words unchanged, without heeding their irreconcilable  
character; that the comm. takes *dyā́vāpṛthivī́* as vocative is simply in  
accord with his usual disregard of the accent. In **c** and **f**, the  
mss. vary between *ánu-sam* ⌊so most⌋, *anu-sám*, and *ánu sám* (the  
*pada*-mss. have *anu॰sáṁcarema:* but one has *ánu॰saṁcarema!*); SPP.  
adopts *ánu sám* ⌊cf. note to Prāt. iv. 3⌋, against our *anu-sám;* there  
is little choice between the two. In **d**, the mss. in general begin  
with *yaśásām* ⌊some with *yáśasām*⌋, two or three having *yáśasam* or  
*yaśásam;* SPP. adopts the last, we *yáśasā;* here, again, there is  
little to choose; the comm. explains *yaśasā*, though his text (SPP.)  
gives *yaśasām*. The comm. foolishly takes *āyatī́s* in **e** as, jointly  
with *yáśas*, object of *gṛhītvā́* in **f**, supplying *dhenūs* for it to  
qualify. The verse counts (16 + 14: 16 + 14 = 60) as a full  
*atiśakvarī;* ⌊but see beginning of this paragraph⌋.

The earth and heaven have come to be two gatherers up of vigo- rous might. So let us gather vigour up and closely follow after Earth. With glory come the cows and stand beside the master of the herd. Let us when we have gathered fame and glory closely follow Earth.
