### Translation
1. The swiftness of ghee evenly always increasing the year with  
oblation—be our hearing, sight, breath unsevered; unsevered be we from  
life-time, from splendor.

### Notes
The translation implies in **a** *samanā́ sadāí ’vá*. ⌊This last may be a  
slip for *sádāivá*, p. *sádā: evá;* the Berlin text and the *Index*  
imply *sádeva*, p. *sádā॰iva*.⌋ Five authorities give *samanā́* (so in  
p.); five or six, *samanā́ḥ;* the rest *samanāḥ* or *sámanāḥ*, or else  
*samānā́ḥ* or *samānā́* or finally *sámanā;* SPP. accepts the last, from  
only two mss.; the comm. reads *samanāḥ*, and explains it as  
*samānamanaskā*. After it the mss. read *sádevāḥ* (p. *sá॰devāḥ*), but  
the comm. and his text *sadevā*, and SPP. follows these, accenting  
*sádevā*. Ppp. has *yūtis sumanās sudevās* (*s-*). The comm. says that,  
since all words signifying 'motion' also signify 'knowledge,' *jūti*  
here means *sarvatra prasṛtaṁ jñānam!* Ppp. combines in **c** *prāṇa  
ach-*. In **d**, the *pada*-mss. read *áchinnā* instead of *-nāḥ*. The  
connection of the two half-verses is perhaps this: it is prayed that the  
prospering flow of the libations of sacred butter be uninterrupted,  
carrying as a consequence the continuance of physical blessings.

Still equal be the flow of butter ever causing the Year to prosper with oblation. Still be our hearing, sight, and breath uninjured: let us lose nothing of our life and vigour.
