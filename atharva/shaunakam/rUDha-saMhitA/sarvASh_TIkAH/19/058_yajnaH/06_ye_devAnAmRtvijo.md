### Translation
6. They that are priests (*ṛtvíj*) of the gods, and that are worshipful,  
for whom the oblation (*havyá*) is made the portion—coming to this  
sacrifice together with their spouses, let the gods, as many as they are  
(*yā́vant*), revel on the oblation.

### Notes
In **b**, the mss. have also *kriyate, kṛyate*, ⌊*kṛyáte*,⌋ and  
*kṛṇute*. In **c**, the *pada*-mss. read *sahá॰patnībhiḥ*, and nearly  
all the *saṁhitā*-mss. agree with them; SPP. also emends to *pát-*. In  
**d**, all the mss. have *tavíṣā* or *táviṣā* (p. *-ṣā*) SPP. reads,  
with the comm., *taviṣā́s* (= *mahāntaḥ*, comm.); the translation implies  
*havíṣā*, instead of our emendation *sám iṣā́*. The verse ⌊12 + 11: 11 +  
12⌋ has two more syllables than a regular *triṣṭubh;* ⌊the cadences of  
**a, b, c** accord with the number of syllables: but **d**, with 12, has  
a *triṣṭubh* cadence; this casts still further suspicion on *taviṣā*, in  
place of which we should expect only two syllables⌋.

Let the Gods' Priests and those who merit worship, to whom oblation as their share is offered, Come to this holy service with their Consorts, and all Gods revel in the food we bring them.
