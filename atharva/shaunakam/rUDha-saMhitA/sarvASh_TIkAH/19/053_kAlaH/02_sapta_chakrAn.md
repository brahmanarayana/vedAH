### Translation
2. Seven wheels doth this time drive; seven \[are\] his naves,  
immortality (*amṛ́ta*) forsooth \[his\] axle; he, time, including (?) all  
these beings, goes on as first god.

### Notes
The principal difficulty is here in the third pāda, where our *arvā́n̄*  
(though accepted by all the translators without any heed to the  
ms.-readings given at the foot of the page) is a very bold and  
questionable emendation, most of the mss. (with the comm. ⌊the ms. has  
*añjan*\*⌋ and SPP.) giving instead *añjat*, a few *añját*, and some of  
ours *anyat* or *ayat* (evidently accidental and unimportant  
variations); Ppp. has *aṅjaṅ* ⌊i.e. *bhuvanānyaṅjaṅ*⌋; *arvā́ṅ̄* is not to  
be accepted as at all satisfactory, much less authoritative; it is no  
proper antithesis to *pratyán̄*† in 3 **c**, nor construable with the  
accusative. The translation, for a venture, implies *bhúvanā nyañján*,  
evolving a sense for *nyañján* out of *nyàkta* 'inherent'; it may pass  
for what it is worth. All the mss., and SPP., read in **a** *cakrā́n*  
⌊and so does Ppp.⌋; the comm. has *cakrā ’nu vahati*. The redundancy of  
syllables in **d** could be easily remedied either by omitting the  
superfluous *sá* (left out in the translation) or by reading *īrte* for  
*īyate* ⌊or by reading *sé ”yate* with double *saṁdhi* as Ppp.  
suggests⌋. Ppp. reads *kāle sāiyyate*. The comm. has in **b** *amṛtaṁ  
tanv akṣaḥ*. ⌊For the *nú* of **d**, the ms. of the comm. has in fact  
*u*.⌋ \*⌊The comm. has in one place *añjat*, explained as *añjan;* and,  
in another, the ms. of the comm. has (as noted) *añjan*, which SPP.  
prints as *añjat* = *prerayan!*⌋ †⌊It is a curious fact that Whitney  
here anticipates and parries the very argument in favor of the  
Roth-Whitney emendation *arvā́n̄* which Bloomfield later adduces, SBE.  
xlii. 684. W. may have written this in 1893 or thereabouts. Bl's  
translation appeared in 1897.⌋

This Time hath seven rolling wheels and seven naves immorality is the chariot's axle. This Time brings hitherward all worlds about us: as primal Deity is he entreated.
