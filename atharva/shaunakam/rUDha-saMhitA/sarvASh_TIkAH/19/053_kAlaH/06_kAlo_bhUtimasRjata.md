### Translation
6. Time created the earth; in time burns (*tap*) the sun; in time  
\[are\] all existences; in time the eye looks abroad.

### Notes
Our *bhū́mim* in **a** is an emendation for the *bhūtím* of the mss.:  
SPP. accepts *bhūtím;* the comm. explains it as = *bhavanavaj jagat*.  
Ppp. reads bhūtam *asṛjat;* it also omits *ha* in **c**.

Kala created land; the Sun in Kala hath his light and heat. In Kala rest all things that be: in Kala doth the eye discern.
