### Translation
3. A full vessel is set upon time; we indeed see it, being now  
manifoldly; it \[is\] in front of all these beings; it call they time in  
the highest firmament (*vyòman*).

### Notes
⌊For '\[is\] in front of' W. interlines the alternative 'faces toward.'⌋  
All the mss. ⌊save W's P.: *santúḥ*⌋ read at end of **b** *santás*, and  
SPP. retains it, without even changing its false accent; the comm.  
glosses it with *satpuruṣās*, or, in an alternative explanation, with  
*sadrūpabrahmopāsakās*. Our emendation to *sántam* is supported by Ppp.,  
which gives *ni santaṁ*. We also emend the *páśyāmas* of the mss. (and  
SPP.) to *paśy-*. Ppp. combines in **a** to *adhi kālā ”hitas*, and  
reads in **c** *pratyaṁ*. The highly obscure 'full vessel' is thus  
illuminated (?) by the comm.: *pūrṇaḥ sarvatra vyāptaḥ kumbhaḥ kumbhavat  
kumbho ’horātramāsartusaṁvatsarādirūpo ‘vacchinno janyaḥ kālaḥ*.

On Time is laid an overflowing beaker: this we behold in many a place appearing. He carries from us all these worlds of creatures. They call him Kala in the loftiest heaven.
