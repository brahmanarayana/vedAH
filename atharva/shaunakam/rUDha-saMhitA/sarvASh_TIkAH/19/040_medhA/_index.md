### Comment
Of this hymn only the first verse occurs in Pāipp. (in xix.). The comm. reports no viniyoga, but SPP. supplies one, finding it quoted in Pariś. 37. 4, in a ceremony of expiation for the loss (nāśa) of a strainer; ⌊and again, in 37. 14, for use in case a certain earthen vessel (upayāma) falls from the hand⌋.


### Translations
Translated; Griffith, ii. 297.
