### Translation
1. Arise, O Brahmaṇaspati; awaken the gods with the sacrifice; increase  
\[his\] life-time, breath, progeny, cattle, fame, and the sacrificer  
\[himself\].

### Notes
The mss. vary between *paśúm* and *paśū́n* in the second half-verse.  
*Kīrtím* is pretty evidently intruded, spoiling the ⌊otherwise good  
*anuṣṭubh*⌋ meter; the Anukr. reckons it to the fourth pāda. The  
*paddhati* uses the verse (see note to Kāuś. 6. 21) in the course of the  
*darśapūrṇamāsa* ceremony.
