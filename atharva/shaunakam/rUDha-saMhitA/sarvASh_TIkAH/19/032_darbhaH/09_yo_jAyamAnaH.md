### Translation
9. He that, being born, made firm the earth, that propped (*stabh*) the  
atmosphere and the sky, whose wearer evil hath not found out—that  
*darbhá* here \[is\] our supporter \[and\] blessing.

### Notes
Or, 'be our supporter.' Here at the end, the translation follows the  
very acceptable reading of Ppp., *dharuṇo ‘dhivākaḥ*. All the mss. give  
*váruṇo* ⌊one, *váruṇó!*⌋ *divā́ kaḥ* (the comm. *divā ’kaḥ*), which was  
plainly corrupt, but which SPP. (justifiably, from his point of view)  
retains without question. Roth's emendation, as read in our text, to  
*váraṇo ‘dhivākáḥ* hit very near the mark. All the mss. (except,  
doubtless by accident, one of ours) have in **c** *viveda*, without  
accent, and this SPP. admits in his text, though emendation (to  
*vivéda*, as made in our edition) is as obviously necessary as in vs. 8.  
All the mss. ⌊but O. *tanú*⌋, and Ppp., read in **c** *nanú;* ⌊and so  
does SPP.;⌋ our emendation to *nā́ ’nu* is acceptable, but not necessary.  
The comm. explains quite prosaically the plant's 'making firm the  
earth'; its roots keep the ground from being dissolved by water! The  
last words he understands thus: *varuṇa* (as coming from *vṛ*) means a  
keeper off (*nivāraka*) of darkness; and *divā ’kaḥ* signifies *prakāśaṁ  
karotu*. ⌊Ppp. begins **b** with *so ‘stabh-*.⌋

He who first born fixed earth in her position, he who established heaven and air's mid-region, Whom sinner ne'er hath known as his supporter,--this Darbha be our shelter and protection!
