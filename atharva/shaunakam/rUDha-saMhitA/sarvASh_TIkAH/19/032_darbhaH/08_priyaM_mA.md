### Translation
8. Make me, O *darbhá*, dear to Brahman-and-Kshatriya, both to śūdra and  
to Āryan, and to whomsoever we desire, and to every one that looks  
abroad.

### Notes
That is, 'every one that has eyes to see.' ⌊Cf. 62. 1, below, and VS.  
xviii. 48.⌋ A few authorities have the more proper accent *-nyā́bhyām*,  
but VS. xxvi. 2 (which has this and the following four words together)  
likewise accents *-nyà-*, as does SPP. Our *śūdrā́ya* was an emendation,  
all our mss. ⌊collated at time of publication⌋ having *sūryā́ya*, as do  
nearly all SPP's; but one of our later ones, with two or three of SPP's,  
the comm., and Ppp., give *śūdrā́ya*. All the mss. mis-accent *vipáśate*,  
most having *vipaśyaté*, others *vípaśyate* or *vipaśyate;* SPP. this  
time ventures to follow us in emending to ⌊*vipáśyate*⌋ the true  
reading. The Anukr. regards *brahmarājanyā̀bhyām* as belonging to the  
first pāda, and does not heed that the pāda has 13 syllables, one too  
many for a *purastādbṛhatī*.

Do thou, O Darbha, make me dear to Brahman and Rajanya, dear to Sudra, and to Arya dear, Yea, dear to every man we love, to every man with eyes to see.
