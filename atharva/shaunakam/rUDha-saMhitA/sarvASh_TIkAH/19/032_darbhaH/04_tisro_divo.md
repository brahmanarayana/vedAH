### Translation
4. Thou didst bore through the three skies, also these three earths; by  
thee do I bore into my enemy's (*durhā́rd*) tongue \[and\] utterances  
(*vácas*).

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
In **a**, SPP. reads more correctly *divás*, with nearly all the mss.  
The comm. reads *atṛṇas;* he explains *aty atṛṇas* by *atikramya gatavān  
asi* or *veṣṭitavān asi*, and *ni tṛṇadmi* by *veṣṭayāmi*, both very  
unsuitably. The meter clearly calls for *ca* at the end, and Ppp. has  
it; whether the comm. means to acknowledge it as part of the text is  
doubtful; his text, according to SPP., does not present it. ⌊None of the  
other authorities has *ca*, but the Berlin ed. gives *ca* by  
emendation.⌋ Ppp. reads in **b** *tisro dyāṁ pṛth-*.

Through all three skies the plant hath pierced, and the three regions of the earth; With thee I split in twain the tongue and words of the bad- hearted man.
