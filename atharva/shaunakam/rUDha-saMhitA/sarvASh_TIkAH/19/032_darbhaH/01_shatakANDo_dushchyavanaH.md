### Translation
1. Hundred-jointed, hard to be stirred, thousand-leaved, uplifting  
(?)—the *darbhá* that is a formidable herb, that I bind on thee in order  
to \[prolonged\] life-time.

### Notes
Some of the mss., as usual, read *duścav-* in **a**. Very nearly all  
read *uttirás* in **b** (p. *ut॰tiráḥ*), and SPP. follows them; and this  
the translation implies, since it is acceptable enough ⌊cf., for the  
formation, *uttudás*, iii. 25. 1, and, for the meaning, *uttirán*, vi.  
36. 2⌋, and appears in Ppp. (with *-rṇam* before it); but the comm. has  
*úttaras*, as our text by conjectural emendation. Some mss. have *tát*  
for *tám* in **d**; the comm., *tena* for *taṁ te*. ⌊Ppp. combines  
*yograoṣadhis* in **c**, which is susceptible of more than one  
interpretation.⌋ ⌊The gender of *ugrás* would seem to call for some  
remark.⌋

For lengthened life I bind on thee the Darbha grass, the mighty plant. Excellent, hard to overthrow, with hundred stems and thousand blades.
