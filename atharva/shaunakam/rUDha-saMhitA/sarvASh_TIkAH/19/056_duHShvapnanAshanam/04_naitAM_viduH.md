### Translation
4. Not the Fathers, and not the gods, know it, whose (pl.) murmur goes  
about within here; in Trita Āptya did the men (*nṛ́*), the Ādityas,  
taught by Varuṇa, set sleep.

### Notes
The mss. read at the beginning *nāí ’tā́m* ⌊and so SPP.⌋, the *etā́m* 'it'  
apparently being viewed as relating to *jálpis;* the comm. makes the  
relation plainer by giving in **b** *yāi ’ṣām;* but this latter SPP.  
rejects. At end of **b**, the mss. vary between *antarétám* and *antaré  
’dám* (p. *antarā́: idám*); the comm. gives the latter, and SPP. accepts  
it; Ppp. also has it; ⌊and it is implied in the translation⌋. The mss.,  
as always, vary between *tṛté* and *trité;* the great majority here give  
the former. *Váruṇena* in **d** was our emendation for *ár-*; it is read  
also by the comm., and by one of SPP's mss., and is found in Ppp.; SPP.  
also adopts it in his text. The mss. all accent *ā́dityāsas*, and SPP.  
does not emend, as we do, to *ādityā́sas*. Ppp. reads in **b** *jalpyaś  
c-*, and has for **c** *trite svapnam arididṛhā prate narā* (*ādit-*).  
With **c**, compare RV. viii. 47. 13-17 and especially 15 **c, d**. The  
comm. tells a tale of how *duḥsvapna*, having received overlordship from  
the gods, waxed topping, and seized on the Ādityas; the latter applied  
for relief to Varuṇa, and, duly instructed by him, put off the  
*duḥsvapna* upon the great seer (*maharṣi*) Trita, son of the waters:  
this is pretty plainly no tradition, but an account devised by the comm.  
to fit the immediate case.

Of him nor Fathers nor the Gods have knowledge, the Gods whose gentle talk is still about him. Urged by command of Varuna the Adityas, Heroes, transported Sleep to Trita Aptya.
