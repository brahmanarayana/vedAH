### Translation
3. He of great kine (?) turned unto the gods away from the Asuras,  
seeking greatness; to that sleep the three-and-thirty ones, having  
attained the sky, imparted over-lordship.

### Notes
At the beginning, the *saṁhitā*-mss. in general read *bṛhád gā́vā* (p.  
*bṛhát: gā́vā* or *grā́vā*); Ppp. has *vṛhaṁgrāvā* ⌊combining  
*-vāsurebhyo*⌋; the comm. gives *bṛhadgāvā*, as nom. of *-gāvan*,  
deriving it from *gā* 'go'; and SPP. accepts this (*bṛhadgā́vā*, p.  
*bṛhat॰gā́vā*), while at the same time suggesting that *-gavó* may be  
meant, by such a confusion of the two modes of writing *o* as we have  
already more than once ⌊cf. 55. 5 **b** and the note⌋ had occasion to  
conjecture. Ppp. reads *‘bhi* instead of *‘dhi*. There is discordance  
among the mss. as to the accent of *upā ’vartata*. Ppp. reads at end of  
**b** *ṛcchan*. The majority of mss. have in **d** *tráyastriṅśāsá sv-*;  
and part of the *pada*-mss. divide *tráyaḥ॰triṅśāḥ: sáḥ: sv-;* SPP.  
gives *trayastriṅśā́saḥ sv-*, as do we.
