### Translation
2. The all-vigorous bond saw thee in the beginning, in the one day  
before the birth of night; from thence, O sleep, didst thou come  
(*ā-bhū*) hither, hiding thy form from the physicians.

### Notes
In this verse also, for the reason given above, the translation follows  
the mss. more closely than does our text. Nearly all authorities have at  
the beginning *bandhás;* a couple ⌊the reciters, K. and V.⌋, with the  
comm., *bandhús* (wrong accent ⌊as in vs. 5⌋); Ppp. reads *baṁbhas*. All  
have *viśvácayās* (p. *viśvá॰cayāḥ*), though in some of them the *c*  
could be read as *v;* the comm. is able to make a sense for it:  
*sarvasya cetā, saṁceta, sraṣṭā;* the translation implies *viśvāvayās*,  
as the smallest possible intelligible change; Ppp. presents  
*viśvavathāv* ⌊and *apaśyan*⌋. The *pada*-mss. divide in **b** *rā́tryā:  
jánitaḥ: réke;* the comm. understands, with us, *rā́tryāḥ: jánitoḥ: éke;*  
and SPP. substitutes this in his *pada*-text. *Eke ahni* ⌊which Ppp.  
combines to *eke ‘hni*⌋ might, of course, also be understood as locative  
absolute. Our *tátas* at beginning of **c** was an emendation for *táva*  
of the mss.; the comm. has it (also Ppp.), and SPP. accordingly also  
adopts it in his text. The whole pāda reads in Ppp.: *tatas svapnena  
madhyā ca bhāyatha*. In **d** all the mss. have *bhiṣágbhya r-*, and the  
*pada*-mss. *bhiṣágbhya॰rūpam* (!); only one or two give an accent to  
*rūpám;* the comm. understands *bhiṣágbhyo rūpám*, and SPP. reads this;  
the translation follows it. There is much discordance as to the accent  
of *apagūhamānas*. Ppp. reads *bhiṣajña rūpam apigūh-*. The comm. is a  
grammarian of such sort that he does not accept *éke* as used here for  
the more regular *ékasmin;* but he does accept *ahni* as used, by the  
ordinary license to put one case in place of another, for *ahnas*,  
coördinate in construction with *rātryās;* and *eke* means  
*mānasaprajāpatyādayas*, and is subject of *apaśyan* understood! The  
evil-dreaming hid itself away from the medicine-men, says the comm.,  
lest they should meet it with an efficacious remedy; and something like  
that is possibly the real meaning.

At first the all-containing, depth beheld thee, ere Night was born, when only Day existed. Thence hast thou come, thence, Sleep, hast thou come hither, concealing, deep within, all form and figure.
