### Translation
1. Out of Yama's world hast thou come hither (*ā-bhū*); with mirth (?)  
dost thou, wise, make use of (*pra-yuj*) mortals; knowing, thou goest in  
alliance (*sarátham*) with the solitary one, fashioning (*mā*) sleep in  
the lair (*yóni*) of the Asura.

### Notes
If *prámadā* (p. *prá॰madā*) is to be rendered as above, it must have  
its accent changed to *pramádā;* the comm., against the *pada*-text,  
understands it as *pramadās* = *striyas*, joint object with *mártyān* of  
*prá yunakṣi*. One or two mss. read *mártān* in **b**. The comm. renders  
*dhīras* by *dhṛṣṭas*. ⌊Apart from Ws P.M.W., which have *svā́pnam*,⌋ all  
the mss., the comm., and SPP., read *svápnam* in **d**, and the  
translation follows this rather than our *svápna*, willing, in so  
obscure a matter, to stick as closely to the authorities as possible.  
Ppp., to be sure, gives *svapna mi-*, but this counts for very little.  
The comm. understands the verse to be addressed to the demon of  
ill-dreaming (*he duḥsvapnābhimānin krūra piśāca*); but his explanations  
through the whole hymn are worthless, being only the etymologizing  
guesses of one to whom the real sense is precisely as obscure as it is  
to us: *asura* is *prāṇavant ātman;* the 'lonely one' is the man who is  
dying of the effect of evil-dreaming, having abandoned son, wife,  
relatives, etc.; *yāsi* means *yantalokam prāpayasi;* and so on, and so  
on. ⌊Griffith cites "Death and his brother Sleep" of Shelley's Queen Mab  
(it is found also at Iliad xiv. 231) and "the twins, Sleep and Death,"  
II. xvi. 682.⌋

Thou art come hither from the world of Yama: thou, resolute, affectest men with rapture. Thou, Sleep, created in the Asura's dwelling, goest, well-know- ing, with the solitary.
