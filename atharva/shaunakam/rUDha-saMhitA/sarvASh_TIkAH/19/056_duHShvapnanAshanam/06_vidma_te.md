### Translation
6. We know all thine attendants (?) in front; we know, O sleep, who is  
thine over-ruler here; protect us here with the glory of the glorious  
one; go thou away far off with poisons.

### Notes
In **b**, the *pada*-mss. give blunderingly *svapna॰yáḥ*. Ppp. reads *yo  
‘dhipā hyo te*. Of course, *yaśasvinas* in **c** may be accus. pl., 'us  
who are glorious'; the comm. takes it so, and explains that the glory  
comes from our wonderful knowledge as set forth in the first half-verse.  
⌊Ppp. reads *yaśaso hi* for *yáśase ’há*. In **d**, the *saṁhitā*-mss.  
(also Ppp.) give *ārā́dviṣ;* which is equivalent to *ārā́ddviṣ-*; and the  
*pada*-mss. assume the latter, dividing *ārā́t: dviṣébhiḥ;* since a  
derivative *dviṣá* is as good as unknown, and of a very unusual  
formation, we preferred to read *viṣébhis;* ⌊the comm., text and  
exposition, has *dviṣobhis;*⌋ SPP. has *dviṣébhis*. In **a** the  
translation of *parijā́s* is that of the comm. (= *parijanān*), which  
seems more probable than the conjecture of the Pet. Lexx., "perhaps  
places of origin."

Of old we know all places whence thou comest. O Sleep, we know him who is here thy ruler. Protect us here illustrious with glory. Go, from afar, with poisons, into distance.
