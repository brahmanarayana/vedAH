### Translation
2. Force in my thighs, speed in my calves, firm standing in my feet, all  
things of mine uninjured, myself not down-fallen.

### Notes
⌊Passing in silence some minor details of variation,⌋ the mss. read  
*ója* instead of *ójas* ⌊but *ójaḥ* is found in two or three  
*pada*-mss.⌋; ⌊about ten authorities⌋ leave *jan̄ghayos* unaccented; they  
accent *jávas* or *javás*, and *pā́dayos* or *pādáyos;* some insert a  
blundering *avasāna* between *pā́dayoḥ* and *pratiṣṭhā́;* ⌊all accent  
*ariṣṭā́ni* instead of *ár-*;⌋ and end with *sárvān mā́ ’tipṛṣṭhāḥ* or  
*-ṣṭhā* (p. *áti॰pṛṣṭhā* or *-āḥ*). SPP. follows our emendations quite  
closely: but he corrects to *ján̄ghayos;* accents *javás* (which is  
rather to be preferred\*); ⌊accents correctly *pā́dayos:* the accent of  
the Berlin ed. should be amended accordingly;⌋ leaves the *avasāna*  
after *pā́dayoḥ;* and forgets in *saṁhitā*-text to combine *pratiṣṭhā́*  
and *áriṣṭāni* into *pratiṣṭhā́ ’ris-*; the mss., however, commit the  
same oversight, although the *pada*-text reads *prati॰sthā́* (not *-ā́ḥ*).  
The blunder arises possibly from the transference of the *avasāna*-sign  
from its proper place after *pratiṣṭhā́* (to which our text restores it)  
to the place before that word. The metrical definitions of the Anukr.  
for these two bits of prose are naturally worthless, and the extensive  
emendations in our text make them still more inapplicable. \*⌊In RV. the  
masc. *javá* is oxytone, and the neuter *jávas* is paroxytone; but at  
iii. 50. 2 and iv. 27. 1 we have the adjective stem *javás:* cf. *Gram.*  
§1 151. 2. e.⌋

May I have power in my thighs, swiftness in my legs, stedfast- ness in my feet. May all my members be uninjured and my soul unimpaired.
