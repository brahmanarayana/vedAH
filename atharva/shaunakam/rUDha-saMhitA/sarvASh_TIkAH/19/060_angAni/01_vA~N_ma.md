### Translation
1. Speech in my mouth, breath in my nostrils, sight in my eyes, hearing  
in my ears, my hair not gray, my teeth not broken, much strength in my  
arms.

### Notes
A similar enumeration is found in TS. (in v. 5. 9²), TA. (x. 72, in  
supplement: ⌊p. 887 of Poona ed.⌋), and PGS. (in i. 3. 25): *vā́n̄ ma  
āsán* (PGS. *āsye*) *nasóḥ prāṇò ‘kṣyóś cákṣuḥ kárṇayoḥ śrótram bāhuvór  
bálam ūruvór ójó ‘riṣṭā víśvāny án̄gāni* (PGS. *‘riṣṭāni me ‘n̄gāni*)  
*tanū́s tanúvā me sahá;* it covers both verses of our hymn and the  
beginning of the next. ⌊MGS. i. 4. 4 may be compared.⌋ Nearly all the  
*saṁhitā*-mss. read *āsyán* ⌊like those of Kāuś.⌋ *násoḥ;* ⌊and the  
*pada*-reading is *āsyám: násoḥ*⌋. Further on, the mss. read *akṣóḥ* or  
*akṣyoḥ* (one of ours and one of SPP's give *akṣṇóḥ;* our text gives  
*akṣṇóḥ*, but it should be *akṣyóḥ*, as everywhere else in the Atharvan,  
and as in the parallel texts); yet further, *ápalitā kéśā* ⌊or *keśā́*⌋  
*śóṇaditā báha* (or *váha*) *bā́hvor bálam*. SPP. follows our emendations  
(even *akṣṇós*) throughout; except that he very properly corrects our  
*bāhvòs* to *bāhvós*. Instead of *áśoṇā dántāḥ* the minor Pet. Lex.  
suggests *áśīrṇā d-*, which is decidedly preferable, and is implied in  
the translation.

May I have voice in my mouth, breath in my nostrils, sight in mine eyes, hearing in mine ears, hair that hath not turned gray, teeth free from yellowness, and much strength in mine arms.
