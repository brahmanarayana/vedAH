### Translation
9. Thou whom Ikshvāku of old knew, or thou whom Kushṭhakāmya \[knew\],  
whom Vāyasa, whom Mātsya—thereby art thou all-healing.

### Notes
There is almost nothing here that is not very questionable. Only the  
comm. has *ikṣvākus* in **a**; the majority of mss. give *íṣvākas*, but  
some (which SPP. follows) *íkṣvākas*. In **b** the *pada*-mss. divide  
*kuṣṭha: kāmyàḥ*, and the comm. so understands it (*kāmya* =  
*kāmaputra*); SPP. follows them; though here our emendation to  
*kuṣṭha-kāmyàs* seems plainly called for. In **c**, the mss. have *yáṁ  
vā váso* (or *vā́so:* SPP. *váso*) *yám ā́tsyas t-*; the text of the  
comm., *yaṁ vā vaso yamāsyas* (explained as "having a mouth like  
Yama's"!); here emendation is a rather desperate undertaking; the  
translation follows the conjectures of our text ⌊but with *íkṣvākur* in  
**a**⌋. Ppp. reads, in **a-c**, *pūrvakṣvāko yaṁ vā tvā kuṣṭikāś ca  
ahiśyāvaso anusāricchas tenā-* etc.—too corrupt to give any help.

Thou whom Ikshvaku's ancestor, whom he who well-loved Kushtha, knew, Whom Vayasa and Matsya knew, hence healer of all ills art thou.
