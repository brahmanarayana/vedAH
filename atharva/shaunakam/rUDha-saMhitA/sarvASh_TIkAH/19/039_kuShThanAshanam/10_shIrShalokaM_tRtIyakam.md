### Translation
10. The head-paining, the tertian, ⌊and⌋ that which is constant, is  
hibernal—the *takmán*, O thou of power in every direction, do thou impel  
(*sū*) away downward.

### Notes
The last half-verse is identical with v. 22. 3 **c, d**, above. The mss.  
read in **a** *śīrṣalokám* (p. *-ṣa॰lo-*); and the comm. understands it  
as two words, *śīrṣa lokam*, translating "they call thy head the third  
world (i.e. the sky, which is third world in respect to earth)"! Ppp.  
has *śīrṣālākaṁ*. The comm. reads in **c** *-vīryam*, with his customary  
disregard of accent; ⌊some mss. accent *viśvádhā*, thus suggesting  
*viśvádhāvīryam* (epithet of *takmā́nam*) as a possible, if inferior,  
variant⌋. Only two or three of the mss. give the accent *tṛ́tīyakam*,  
found elsewhere in the text (i. 25. 4: v. 22. 13), and SPP. follows the  
majority and adopts *tṛtī́-*. SPP. is also inconsistent in writing in  
*pada*-text *sadam॰díḥ* but in *saṁhitā*-text *sadandír;* Ppp. has  
instead *sadantī*.
