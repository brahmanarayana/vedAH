### Translation
1. Let the heavenly rescuing *kúṣṭha* come hither from off the snowy  
\[mountain\]; do thou make vanish all *takmán* and all the sorceresses.

### Notes
Of course, *himávant* may also be rendered 'Himālaya.' ⌊For *-tas pari*,  
cf. note to Prāt. ii. 67.⌋ Emendation in **c** to *nāśáyan* is suggested  
as acceptable; ⌊and *nāśayaṁ* is the reading of Ppp., both here and in 5  
**f**⌋. Some of the mss. read at the beginnings *étu;* the *pada*-mss.  
have blunderingly *āitu* instead of *ā́: etu;* SPP. emends to the latter.
