### Translation
5. Thrice from the śāmbus, from the An̄girases, thrice from the Ādityas,  
thrice from the All-Gods art thou born; this all-healing *kúṣṭha* stands  
along with soma; do thou make vanish all the *takmán* and all the  
sorceresses.

### Notes
All the authorities ⌊save Ppp.⌋ agree in *śā́mbubhyas*, and our  
alteration to *bhṛ́gubhyas* is not to be approved. All our  
*saṁhitā*-mss., and the majority of SPP's *saṁhitā*-authorities, with  
the text of the comm., read after it *án̄gireyebhyas* (one or two  
*-raye-*), and the comm. takes the word as adjective (= *an̄girasām  
apatyabhūtebhyaḥ*) qualifying *śā́mbubhyas*. SPP. adopts *án̄girebhyas*,  
with the rest of the mss.; our emendation to *-robhyas* is a very simple  
and plausible one, when dealing with a text in the condition of this.  
Ppp. is very corrupt: *tiṣyāmividyogirayebhyas;* in **d**, further, it  
has *-bheṣaja*, in **e** *tiṣṭhasi*, in **f** *nāśayaṁ* (as in 1 **c**).  
SPP., probably by an oversight, inserts a stroke of interpunction  
between **d** and **e**; it is against the Anukr., and our mss. do not  
have it.
