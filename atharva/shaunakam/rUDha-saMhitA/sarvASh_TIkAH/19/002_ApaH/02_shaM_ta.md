### Translation
2. Weal to thee \[be\] the waters of the wastes, weal be to thee those  
of the marshes; weal to thee the waters of the canals (*khanitríma*),  
weal those brought with vessels.

### Notes
Ppp. has again *śaṁ tā ”po dh-*; ⌊also *-trimā ”paś ś-*⌋. TA. (in vi. 4.  
1) has a verse and a half similar to these two, and in part accordant  
with them (reading corruptly *anū́kyās*): ⌊Poona ed., p. 420, rightly  
*anūkyā̀s*⌋. Our i. 6. 4 above is still more closely analogous.

Sweet unto thee be Waters of the waste and Waters of the pool. Sweet be the Waters dug from earth, to thee, and Waters brought in jars.
