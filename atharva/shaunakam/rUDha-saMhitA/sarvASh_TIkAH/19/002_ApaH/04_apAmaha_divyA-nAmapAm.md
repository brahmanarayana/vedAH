### Translation
4. Of the waters indeed from the sky, of the waters from the streams  
(*srotasyà*)—in the forth-washing indeed of the waters, ye become  
vigorous (*vājín*) horses.

### Notes
The last pāda is very literally rendered; anything else would require  
some alteration of the text; it is identical with i. 4. 4 **c**. SPP.  
reads in **a** *divyā̀nām*, with very nearly all the mss.; the emendation  
of accent ⌊*divyā́-*, as in the Berlin text⌋ is unquestionably to be  
made. ⌊Error due to *srotasyā̀nām?*⌋

Bathed in the Waters verily divine, in water of the streams, Bathed in the Waters verily, O Horses, be ye fleet and strong.
