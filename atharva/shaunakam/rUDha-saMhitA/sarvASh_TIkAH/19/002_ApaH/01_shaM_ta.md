### Translation
1. Weal to thee \[be\] the waters from the snowy mountains  
(*hāimavatá*), and weal be to thee those from the fountains; weal to  
thee the running waters, and weal to thee be those of the rain.

### Notes
Our *saniṣyadā́s* in **c** is an emendation, and called for ⌊see *Skt.  
Gram.* § 1148. 4. k., near the end⌋; all the mss., and SPP., accent  
*saniṣyádās*. Many of the mss. accent *té* in **d**. The comm. omits *u*  
in **b**. The *pada*-mss. make the absurd division *sani॰syádāḥ*. Ppp.  
makes the combinations *śaṁ tā ”po* and *-ṣyadā ”paś ś-*.

Blest be the Streams from hills of snow, sweet be spring Waters unto thee. Sweet be swift-running Waters, sweet to thee be Water of the Rains.
