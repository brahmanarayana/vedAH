### Translation
2. Heavenly fortunate design (*ā́kūti*) do I put forward (*puro-dhā*);  
let the mother of intent (*cittá*) be easy of invocation for us; to what  
expectation I go, be it entirely mine; may I find it entered into \[my\]  
mind.

### Notes
Half the mss. accent in **b** *cíttasya;* in **c** and **d**, all have  
*emi* and ⌊nearly all⌋ *vídeyam*, which SPP. accordingly admits into his  
text; our *émi* and *vidéyam* are necessary emendations: in such a  
condition of text as is offered in this book, it is useless to be  
governed by the tradition when it is certainly and palpably wrong. The  
verse is found also in TB. (in ii. 5. 3²), which reads in **a**  
*mánasas* for *subhágām*, in **b** ⌊*yajñásya* for *cittásya* and⌋ *me*  
for *nas*, and for **c, d** *yád icchā́mi mánasā sákāmo vidéyam enad  
dhṛ́daye níviṣṭam*. Ppp. reads *devyām* in **a**, and *me ‘stu* in **b**  
⌊? or **c**?⌋. The first pāda is the only *jagatī* element in the verse.

In front I set Intention, blessed Goddess. Mother of thought, may she be prompt to hear us. Mine, and mine only, be the hope I fashion! May I gain this that hath possessed my spirit.
