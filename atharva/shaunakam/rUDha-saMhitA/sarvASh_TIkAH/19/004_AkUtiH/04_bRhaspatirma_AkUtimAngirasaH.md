### Translation
4. Let Brihaspati acknowledge my design, the son of An̄giras this \[my\]  
speech; of whom the gods, the deities, came into being, let that desire  
(*kā́ma*), well-conducting, go after us.

### Notes
*Kā́mas* in **d** is shown both by meter and by sense to be intrusive;  
also the omission of *vā́cam* in **b** would improve the verse in both  
respects, making it easier to understand *ān̄girasás* as simply epithet  
of Bṛhaspati. The mss. differ in their accent of *sambabhūvus;* ⌊of  
SPP's authorities, about seven accent *sám-*, and four accent *-vúḥ*⌋.  
All read in **d** *supráṇītās*, which SPP. accepts in his text. Ppp.  
gives *tasya devā devatā saṁbabhūva śiśupraṇīha*, which is too corrupt  
to give any help. Ppp. also combines in **a** *mā ”kūtiṁ*. The comm. has  
*abhy etu* in **d**. The omission of metrical definition by the Anukr.  
seems due to a lacuna. ⌊If the suspicions resting on *vācam* and *kāmas*  
are justified, the vs. would scan smoothly as 8 + 11: 11 + 11.⌋

Prajapati Angirasa with favour regard this word and this my settled purpose! May he, whence Gods and Deities had being Kama attend us with his gentle guidance.
