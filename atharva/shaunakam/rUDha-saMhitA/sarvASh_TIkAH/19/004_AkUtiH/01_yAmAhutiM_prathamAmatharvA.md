### Translation
1. What oblation (*ā́huti*) Atharvan sacrificed first, with what one  
Jātavedas made an offering, that same do I first call loudly for thee;  
gratified with that, let Agni carry the offering: hail to Agni.

### Notes
This version represents neither of the edited texts, nor the mss., nor  
the comm., but is a pure make-shift. SPP. reads in **a-b** *átharvā yā́  
jātā́ yā́ h-*, and at beginning of **d** *tā́bhi ṣṭuptó v-* (p. *tā́bhiḥ:  
stuptáḥ;* so all the *pada*-mss. ⌊but Op. and L. have *sruptáh*⌋; what  
*stuptáḥ* ⌊or *sruptáḥ*, for that matter⌋ should be supposed to be is a  
complete mystery). The comm. reads in **a-b** *atharvā yā jātāya  
havyām*, and in **d** *tābhi stutaḥ;* he explains that Atharvan means  
the *paramātman*, who at the beginning of creation made an oblation to  
please the gods whom he had created; pāda **b** signifies this: "what  
(*yā* being used instead of *yām*) oblation, given by Atharvan,  
Jātavedas made worthy to be offered for his progeny ⌊the progeny of  
Atharvan in the rôle of *paramātman?*⌋: that is, for the crowd of gods  
made manifest by him." Our *āyejé* in **a** is indefensible, but the  
translation implies *ejé* (*ā-ījé*) or something equivalent; in **d** it  
implies *táyā tṛptó v-*; all the mss. have *-pto*, except one of ours  
s.m., which favors the comm. *Johavīmi* possibly comes from root *hu*  
(so BR.) instead of *hū*. We ought to have in **a** *ā́kūtim*, as in the  
following verses, but it is not easy to reconstruct the verse so as to  
match that emendation.
