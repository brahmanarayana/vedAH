### Translation
4. A hundred heroes it generated; a hundred *yákṣmas* it scattered away;  
having slain all the ill-named ones, it shakes down the demons.

### Notes
The mss. (both s. and p.) vary in **a** between *vīrā́s* and *vīrā́n*, the  
decided majority of SPP's giving the latter; of ours, none save one or  
two of those collated since publication; SPP. reads *vīrān aj-*. Ppp.  
has *śataṁ vīrāṇi janayac ch-*, which, with emendation to *vīryāṇi  
janayañ*, is perhaps the true reading. About half, indeed, of the mss.  
read *-nayan*, which also makes a possible text (*śatáṁ vīrā́ ajanayan*).

A hundred men hath it produced, hundred Consumptions chased away, All fiends of evil-name it hath smitten, and shakes the Rakshasas.
