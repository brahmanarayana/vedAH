### Translation
1. The *śatávāra* hath by its keenness (*téjas*) made to vanish the  
*yákṣmas*, the demons, mounting together with splendor, an amulet that  
expels the ill-named.

### Notes
Our *maṇís* in **d** was an emendation, all the mss. having *maṇím;*  
SPP. also has *-ís*, on the authority of the comm.; Ppp. reads *-ṇiṁ*  
and *-śātanam*. What *śatávāra* really means is very questionable; the  
Pet. Lexx. conjecture "consisting of a hundred hairs," which does not  
seem probable; the comm. says "having a hundred roots, or awns"; and he  
further adds, on the authority of vs. 6, where the accordance with  
*vāraya-* is played upon, "warding off a hundred diseases"; moreover,  
there is no reason apparent why it should not signify 'bringing a  
hundred choice things' (cf. *viśvávāra*). The comm. declares 'ill-named'  
to denote a skin-disease. ⌊"Mounting": i.e. being raised up to the neck  
of the person on whom it is "bound"—so Griffith.⌋

The Hundred-haired hath banished hence fiends and Consump- tions by its might. With splendour hath the charm that scares demons of ill-name mounted up.
