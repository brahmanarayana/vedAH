### Translation
3. The *yákṣmas* that are petty, and they that are great, noisy—all of  
them the *śatávāra* amulet, slayer of the ill-named, hath made vanish.

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **b** *śapathinas*. The Anukr. takes no notice of the  
deficiency of a syllable in **a**.

Consumptions, light and serious, and those which sounds accompany, All these the Amulet, Hundred-haired, scarer of fiends, hath banished hence.
