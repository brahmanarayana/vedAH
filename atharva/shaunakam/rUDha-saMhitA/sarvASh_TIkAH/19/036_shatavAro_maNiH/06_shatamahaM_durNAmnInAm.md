### Translation
6. With the *śatávāra* I ward off (*vāraya-*) a hundred of the ill-named  
ones (f.), a hundred of the Gandharvas-and-Apsarases, and a hundred of  
the doglike ones (f.).

### Notes
Some of the mss. accent in **b** *gandharvā́psarásām*. All ⌊save W's B.⌋  
have in **c** *śataṁ śaśvanvátīnām* (varying to *śaścatv-*: p.  
*śaśvan॰vátīnām*); our *śatáṁ ca śvánva-* is an emendation, and, as it  
seems, an easy and necessary one, supported by Ppp., which reads *śataṁ  
ca śunvatīnāṁ* ⌊Griffith renders by 'dog-mated nymphs,' referring it to  
the Apsarases, and citing most appositely xi. g. 15 and iv. 37. 11⌋. The  
comm. reads with the mss., and furnishes one of his characteristic  
absurd explanations: the word comes from *śaśvat* 'constantly,' with *n*  
substituted for *d* in the combination, and means *muhurmuhuḥ pīḍārtham  
āgantryo grahāpasmārādyā vyādhayaḥ!* He declares the fem. *durṇāmnī* to  
be used in **a** ⌊with reference to⌋ *vyādhi*, forgetting that *vyādhi*  
is masculine. ⌊For the play in **d**, cf. my note to xviii. 3. 29.⌋
