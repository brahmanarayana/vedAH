### Translation
6. Thrice the gods generated thee that art settled (*ni-sthā*) upon the  
earth; and Brahmans of old know thee thus as An̄giras by name.

### Notes
All the mss. read at the beginning *tṛṣṭvā́* (p. the same); but even SPP.  
emends to *tríṣ ṭvā*, as we had done; the comm. has the latter. Ppp.  
gives *niṣ ṭvā*. The comm. reads *tiṣṭhantam* in **b** instead of  
*niṣṭhitam*. Some of the mss. are discordant as to the accent of  
*an̄girās* in **c**.
