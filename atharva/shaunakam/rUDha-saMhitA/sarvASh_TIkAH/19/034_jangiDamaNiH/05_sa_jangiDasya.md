### Translation
5. Let that greatness of the *jan̄giḍá* protect us all about, wherewith  
\[it\] overpowered the *víṣkandha* with force, \[being\] a counteracting  
force (?).

### Notes
*Sáṁskandha* occurs nowhere else, and is in the translation assumed to  
be a word made as the opposite and contrary of *víṣkandha;* it may, of  
course, be only a variation of the latter, another evil of the same  
sort, as understood by the Pet. Lexx. and the comm. (*yena rogeṇa  
skandhaḥ saṁnataḥ saṁlagno bhavati sa rogaḥ saṁskandhaḥ*). The majority  
of the mss. read in **c** *sāsáha* (p. *sasaha* ⌊with various accent⌋);  
but *sāsahé* (as in our text) is in accordance with the nearly  
invariable use of the root in AV. as middle, ⌊and is read by one of  
SPP's mss.⌋. Ppp. reads *sāsahā*, and combines in **d** *ojo ‘jasā*. The  
comm. reads and explains in **c** *viṣkandham ojasā saha* (favoring  
*sāsaha*).

Let Jangida's protecting might encompass us on every side. Wherewith he quells Vishkandha and Sanskandha, might by greater might.
