### Translation
1. *Jan̄giḍá* art though, *jan̄giḍá;* defender art thou, *jan̄giḍá;* what  
of ours is two-footed, four-footed—let *jan̄giḍá* defend it all.

### Notes
Our emendation at the beginning to *án̄girā asi* ⌊suggested by vs. 6?⌋ is  
to be disapproved and withdrawn; it is not even necessary to change to  
vocative the *jan̄giḍás* at the end of **a** and **b** (though in the  
translation they may be understood as either nom. or voc); but the comm.  
has *jan̄giḍa* at end of **b**; ⌊the text of the comm. has *jan̄giḍo ‘si  
jan̄giḍo rakṣitā ’si jan̄giḍa*⌋. Compare iv. 12. 1; ix. 5. 16; RV. i. 191.  
1 for similar repetitions, in part of nominatives where we should think  
it more natural to change in part to vocative. SPP. reads ⌊in **a** and  
**b**⌋, with all the mss., *jan̄giḍás* three times. Ppp. has at the  
beginning the corrupt *jan̄giḍisi*, but in both other instances ⌊in **a**  
and **b**⌋ *-ḍas*. Compare the hymn ii. 4, where alone this plant  
appears further. The comm. amuses himself (and us) with a number of his  
ludicrous derivations for *jan̄giḍa*—from roots *jā* or *jan* or *ji*  
with *gir* 'swallow'; or from *jan̄gam*, intensive.
