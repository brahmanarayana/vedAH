### Translation
3. Sapless the artificial noise, sapless the seven that fall apart; away  
from here, O *jan̄giḍá*, make fall (*śat*) misery, as an archer (*ástṛ*)  
an arrow.

### Notes
The first half-verse is perhaps corrupt, as it is certainly  
unintelligible. The *pada*-text makes in **a** the astonishing division  
kṛtrím: *anna॰adám;* many of the *saṁhitā*-mss. read *kṛtṛ́m-*. All the  
mss. accent *vísrasas*, and SPP. with them; our text emends to  
*visrásas*. The minor Pet. Lex. suggests that the *saptá visrúhas* of  
RV. vi. 7. 6 may be meant: ingenious, but not comforting, as no one has  
any idea what the latter signifies. The comm's guess is this:  
*mūrdhaniṣṭheṣu...saptasu cchidreṣv abhicarato ’tpāditāḥ sapta  
niṣyandāḥ*. In **a, b**, the reading of Ppp. is *rasaṁ kṛtrimaṁ nāḍam  
arasas s-*. In **c** the mss. have much unimportant variation of accent.  
At the end, Ppp. gives *sādhayā*. The translation gives to *śātaya* the  
meaning ascribed to it by the Hindu grammarians, since it suits the  
connection; the comm. renders the word by *tanūkuru*, of which it is  
hard to see the reason or sense.
