### Translation
9. To thee, O forest tree, the formidable Indra imparted (*ā-dhā*)  
formidableness; expelling all diseases (*ámīvā*), do thou smite the  
demons, O herb.

### Notes
With the first half-verse compare iv. 19. 8 **d**. For this verse there  
are no variants of any consequence, and the two editions agree  
throughout with one another and with the comm. Ppp. reads in **a-b**  
*vanaspataya indro ’j-*, and, for **c**, *amīvās sarvā rakṣāṅsi*.
