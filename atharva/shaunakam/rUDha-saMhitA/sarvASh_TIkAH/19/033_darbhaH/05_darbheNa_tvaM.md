### Translation
5. With the *darbhá* thou shalt do heroic deeds; wearing the *darbhá*,  
do thou not stagger by thyself; excelling (*ati-sthā*) over others with  
splendor, shine thou like the sun unto the four quarters.

### Notes
Our *kṛṇávas* is an emendation; all the mss., and SPP., give *kṛṇávat*  
or *kṛṇavat*, which the comm. also reads ⌊and renders by *kuryās*⌋  
(without spending a word of explanation on the grammatical anomaly; it  
simply falls under his general rule that in the Veda one form may be  
used in place of another); Ppp. has *kṛṇu*. In **c** SPP. reads, with  
the comm. ⌊but the ms. *atha*⌋, *ádha* instead of our *ádhi* (*varcasā́  
’dhā ’nyā́nt s-*); the mss. have *várcasāidhyányāṁ* (also *-sāiṅdhyá-*,  
*-sāidhá-*, *-sāiṅdhá-*, *-sīdha-*; and the comm's text *-sāudha-*), in  
*pada*-text *várcasā: āidhi* (or *eddhi*): *ányām* (or *anyā́m*), or (in  
our *pada*-mss., and one of SPP's s.m.) *várcasā: edhányām*. Our  
emendation affords better sense, and accounts for the y\* that appears  
in the majority of mss. after *dh*. Ppp. also supports it, reading  
*atiṣṭhāpo varcase ‘dhy anyā sūryāi ’vā bhāhi*. ⌊In **b**, Ppp. reads  
*bibhratā ”tmanā.*⌋ ⌊The comm. has *adhiṣṭhāya* in **c**.⌋ \*⌊But SPP.  
points out that *dhya* and *dhā* look very much alike in most old mss.⌋  
  
⌊Here ends the fourth *anuvāka*, with 7 hymns and 68 verses. If you  
reckoned 27. 14-15 as 3 verses, the sum would be 69.⌋
