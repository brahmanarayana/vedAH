### Translation
2. Snatched out of ghee, rich in honey, rich in milk,  
earth-establishing, unstirred, stirring \[other things\], thrusting away  
and putting down rivals—ascend thou, O *darbhá*, with the energy  
(*indriyá*) of the great ones.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
There are no variants in this verse except of a few mss. on one and  
another point of no consequence. Ppp. has at the end *mahatā  
mahendriyeṇa*. The verse is a sort of variation of v. 28. 14, above;  
⌊and **a** recurs below, 46. 6 **a**⌋.

Drawn forth from butter, juicy, sweetly-flavoured, firm as the earth, unshaken, overthrowing. Driving off foes and casting them beneath me, mount with the strength of mighty Ones, O Darbha.
