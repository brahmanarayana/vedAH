### Translation
1. Desiring what is excellent, the heaven-finding seers in the beginning  
sat down in attendance upon (*upa-ni-sad*) ardor \[and\] consecration;  
thence \[is\] born royalty, strength, and force; let the gods make that  
submissive to this man.

### Notes
*Asmé* 'to us' would be an acceptable emendation in **d**; ⌊but TS. has  
*asmāí*⌋. The comm. glosses *upaníṣedus* simply by *prāptās;* in his  
explanation of **c, d** there is a considerable lacuna. A corresponding  
verse is found in TS. (in v. 7.4³; repeated without variation in TA.  
iii. it. 9): *bhadrám páśyanta úpa sedur ágre tápo dīkṣā́m ṛ́ṣayaḥ  
suvarvídaḥ: tátaḥ kṣatrám bálam ójaś ca jātáṁ tád asmāí devā́ abhí sáṁ  
namantu*.

Desiring bliss, at first, light-finding Rishis began religious rite and holy fervour. Thence energy was born, and might, and kingship: so to this man let gathered Gods incline them.
