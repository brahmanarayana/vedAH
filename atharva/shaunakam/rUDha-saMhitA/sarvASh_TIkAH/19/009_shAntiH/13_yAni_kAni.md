### Translation
13. Whatsoever things that are appeased in the world the seven seers  
know, be they all weal for me; let weal be mine, let fearlessness be  
mine.

### Notes
Many of the mss. accent in **b** *lóke* and *saptárṣayo*. ⌊In **d**  
*asty* is a misprint for *astv*.⌋

May all the Gods protect me, may the Gods united shield me well. May all alleviations in the world which the Seven Rishis know. Be kind and gracious unto me. Bliss and security be mine!
