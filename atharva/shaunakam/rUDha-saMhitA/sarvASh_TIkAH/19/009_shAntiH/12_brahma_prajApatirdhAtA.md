### Translation
12. The *bráhman*, Prajāpati, Dhātar, the worlds, the Vedas, the seven  
seers, the fires—by them happy progress (*svastyáyana*) is made for me:  
let Indra grant (*yam*) me refuge; let Brahmán grant me refuge; let all  
the gods grant me refuge; let the gods all grant me refuge.

### Notes
The Anukr., the comm., and a better connection are here followed, by  
adding to this verse the two pādas which in our edition are printed as  
13 **a, b**, in accordance with the numbering of our mss. (8 + 10: 8 + 8  
+ 8: 10 + 10 = 62, two syllables short of a full *aṣṭi*); SPP. makes the  
same division. Some of SPP's mss. read in **b** *devā́s* instead of  
*vedā́s:* the accent *vedā́s* seems to be modeled on *devā́s*, for 'the  
Vedas' should be *védās*, and the word ought doubtless to be so emended;  
⌊O.D. actually have *védās*, and the comm. says the four Vedas are  
intended⌋. We should expect at the beginning *brahmā́*. ⌊With **c**, cf.  
16. 1 **b**.⌋

Brahma, Dhatar, Prajapati, Worlds, Vedas, Agnis, Rishis Seven. All these have blessed my happy way. May Indra be my guardian, may Brahma protect and shelter me.
