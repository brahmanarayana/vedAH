### Translation
11. Weal \[for us be\] the Rudras, weal the Vasus, weal the Ādityas,  
weal the fires; weal for us the divine great seers, weal the gods, weal  
Bṛihaspati.

### Notes
In **c**, SPP. reads *maharṣáyas*, against most of his authorities  
(although he gives *saptaṛṣáyas* in the two following verses). Some of  
the mss. leave *devās* in **c** unaccented; and two of SPP's treat the  
word in the same manner in **d**. Our emendation in **d** to *devī́s* is  
probably toe venturesome, although it seems strange to have 'the gods'  
mentioned as a body in connection with the mention of so many of them  
separately.

Rudras and Vasus favour us, Adityas, Agnis favour us! Favour us mighty Rishis, Gods, Goddesses, and Brihaspati!
