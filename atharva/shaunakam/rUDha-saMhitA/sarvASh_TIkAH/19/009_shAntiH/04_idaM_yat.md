### Translation
4. Or (?) this mind that is most exalted, sharpened by *bráhman*, by  
which is produced what is terrible—by that be there appeasement for us.

### Notes
All the mss. read in **b** *vām* instead of *vā*, and SPP's text follows  
them. The comm. makes no mention of either in its exposition of the  
verse; but its text (so SPP. reports) reads *vā*, as does ours by  
emendation.

Or, made more keen by Prayer, this mind that standeth in the highest place, Whereby the awful spell was made, even through this be peace to us!
