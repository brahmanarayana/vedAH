### Translation
10. Weal for us be the planets belonging to the moon, and weal the sun  
(*ādityá*) with Rāhu; weal for us smoke-bannered death, weal the Rudras  
of keen brightness.

### Notes
The translation follows in **b** the text of the comm. *ādityaś ca  
rāhuṇā*, as is read also by SPP., who follows the comm. and three or  
four authorities. Most of the mss. have *-tyaḥ śarāhuṇā* (p. also  
*śarāhuṇā*), but two or three *śaṁ rāhuṇā*. Those that accent *-rāhuṇā*  
or *rāhuṇā* at all accent it on the final, *-huṇā́*, and this accent SPP.  
has not dared to change, although it is against all rule and practice.  
In connection with *dhūmaketu* the comm. quotes Kāuś. 127. 1, where the  
word is used; it seems to me extremely unlikely that it signifies a  
comet; ⌊does it not refer rather to the smoke that rises from the  
pyre?⌋.

Kind be the Powers who seize the Moon, with Rahu be Adityas kind! Favour us Death and Cornet, and Rudras with penetrating. might!
