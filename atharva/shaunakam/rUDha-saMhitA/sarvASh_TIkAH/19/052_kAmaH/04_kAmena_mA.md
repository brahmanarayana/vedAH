### Translation
4. By desire hath desire come to me, out of heart to heart; the mind  
that is theirs yonder, let that come unto me here.

### Notes
In TA. (iii. 15. 2) a corresponding verse follows the one quoted under  
vs. 3: *kā́mena me kā́ma ā́ ’gād dhṛ́dayād dhṛ́dayam mṛtyóḥ: yád amī́ṣām adáḥ  
priyáṁ tád āí ’tū́ ’pa mā́m abhí*. SPP. has the same text as we, both  
deviating in **d** from the mss., which leave *upa* unaccented (p.  
*upa॰mā́m*); ⌊but SPP's R. has *úpa mā́m* and the comm. also takes *upa  
mām* as two words⌋. Ppp. combines *kāmā ”gan* in **a**.

O Kama, with whatever wish we make this offering to thee, May it be all fulfilled to us. Then taste this sacrifice, All hail!
