### Translation
2. Thou, O desire, art set firm with power, mighty, shining  
(*vibhā́van*), companion for him who seeks a companion; do thou,  
formidable, overpowering in fights, impart power \[and\] force to the  
sacrificer.

### Notes
The second pāda nearly corresponds with RV. x. 91. 1 **d**, which,  
however, reads *suṣákha sakhīyaté*. The authorities give *sakha ā́  
sakhīyaté* (or *-te*); and the *pada*-mss. make the very blundering  
division *vi॰bhā́u: ā॰sakhe: ā́: sakh-*. ⌊The comm. understands  
*sakhīyate* (not as dative pple, but) as finite verb-form (3d sing.,  
which would have to be accentless: he says *bhavacchabdādhyāhāreṇa  
prathamapuruṣaḥ*. SPP. follows the comm. in reading *vibhā́vā sakha ā́*  
⌊SPP's *pada*-text is *vibhā́॰vā: sakhe: ā́*⌋; but he disagrees with the  
comm. by ⌊making a participle of⌋ *sakhīyaté*, which he accents. The  
translation implies *sákhā*, i.e. *sákhā ā́*. ⌊We have *ā́* with the  
denominative *śravasyāt* at RV. v. 37. 3; but with the pple, *ā́* seems  
very strange; nor do I see how W. meant to take it. One is tempted to  
fall back on the RV. reading *suṣákhā;* the more so, inasmuch as⌋ Ppp.  
presents the RV. reading *suṣakhā*. In **d**, Ppp. has *soho ’jo yaj-*.
