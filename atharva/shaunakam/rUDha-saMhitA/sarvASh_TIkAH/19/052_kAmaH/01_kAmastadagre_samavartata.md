### Translation
1. Desire here came into being (*sam-vṛt*) in the beginning, which was  
the first seed of mind; O desire, being of one origin with great desire,  
do thou impart abundance of wealth to the sacrificer.

### Notes
The first half-verse is nearly identical with RV. x. 129. 4 **a, b**  
⌊TB. ii. 4. 1¹; 8. 9⁴; TA. i. 23. 1⌋, which differ only by adding *ádhi*  
at end of **a**; the word is missed in our verse both for sense and for  
meter. Our text omits\* at beginning of **c** a *sá* (*sá kāma*) that is  
in both these respects superfluous; it is found, however, also in Ppp.  
The comm. explains *kā́mena bṛhatā́* to mean *mahatā  
deśakālavastuparicchedarahitena kāmayitrā parameśvareṇa*. The last pāda  
is xviii. 1. 43 **d**. \*⌊And so accents *kā́ma*.⌋

Thereafter rose Desire in the beginning, Desire the primal seed and germ of Spirit. O Kama dwelling with the lofty Kama, give growth of riches to the sacrificer.
