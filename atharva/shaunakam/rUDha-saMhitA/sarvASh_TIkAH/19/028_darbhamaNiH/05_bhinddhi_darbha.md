### Translation
5. Split, O *darbhá*, my rivals; split those that fight against me;  
split all my enemies (*durhā́rd*); split my haters, O amulet.

### Notes
In the following fourteen verses, of this hymn and the one that follows  
it, only the verb in each pāda is changed. In **c**, Ppp. blunderingly  
reads *chindhi*, anticipating the next verse.

Cleave thou my rivals, Darbha, cleave the men who fain would, fight with me. Cleave all who wish me evil, cleave the men who hate me,. Amulet!
