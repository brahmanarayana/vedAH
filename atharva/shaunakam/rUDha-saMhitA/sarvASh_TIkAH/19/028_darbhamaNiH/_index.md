### Comment
[Brahman (sapatnakṣayakāmaḥ).—daśakam. mantroktadarbhantaṇidevatyam. ānuṣṭubham.]


The hymn is found also in Pāipp. xiii., with very few variants. The comm. finds it ⌊or rather the whole triad of hymns, 28, 29, 30⌋ used by the Nakṣ. K. ⌊17, 19⌋ in a mahāśānti ceremony called āindrī, with binding on of a darbha amulet, by one desiring victory and the like.
