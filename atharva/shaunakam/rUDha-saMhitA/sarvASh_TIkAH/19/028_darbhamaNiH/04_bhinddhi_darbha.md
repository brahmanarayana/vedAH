### Translation
4. Split, O *darbhá*, the heart of our rivals, of our haters, O amulet;  
make their head fly apart, as the rising \[sun\] does the skin of the  
earth.

### Notes
The comm. reads and explains *ni pātaya* in **d** (though the ms. gives  
*vi p-*). The obscure and perhaps corrupt third pāda is thus explained:  
*udyann ūrdhvaṁ gacchan bhujādipradeśam adhitiṣṭhan tvam bhūmyās tvacam*  
\[*iva*\] *tṛṇagulmāuṣadhyādyadhiṣṭhānabhūtāṁ yathā takṣaṇena nipātayati  
gṛhādinirmāṇārthaṁ loke*.

Cleave through. O Darbha, Amulet, my foes', mine adversaries'. heart. Rise thou and batter down their heads like growth that coverethl the earth.
