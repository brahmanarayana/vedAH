### Translation
7. Unto me the amulet of *udumbára*, with both progeny and riches: the  
amulet quickened by Indra hath come to me together with splendor.

### Notes
Either Ppp. lacks 6 **d** and 7 **a-c**, or so much of its text is lost  
in the manuscript. Owe *jinvitás* in **c** was an emendation, all the  
mss. (SPP's as well as ours) giving *jinvátas*, and Ppp. likewise; but  
the comm. has *jinvitas*, and SPP. accordingly adopts it also in his  
text. Some of the mss. leave *upa* at the beginning unaccented.
