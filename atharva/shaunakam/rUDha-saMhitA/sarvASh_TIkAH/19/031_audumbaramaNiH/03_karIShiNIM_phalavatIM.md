### Translation
3. Rich in manure, rich in fruit, *svadhā́* and cheer (*írā*) in our  
house—prosperity let Dhātar assign to me through the keenness (*téjas*)  
of the \[amulet\] of *udumbára*.

### Notes
A few of the mss. again accent *púṣṭim*. Ppp. reads in **a** *karīṣiṇaṁ  
phalāvatīṁ*. The comm. explains *irā* first as = *bhūmi*, and then as =  
*ilā gāuḥ* = *gāvaḥ*.

By power of the Udumbara Charm may Dhatar give me plenty, rich. In the kine's droppings and in fruit, and, in our dwelling, food, and drink.
