### Translation
9. As in the beginning thou, O forest tree, wast born together with  
prosperity, so let Sarasvatī assign to me fatness of riches.

### Notes
Some of the mss. accent *púṣṭyā*, and all ⌊but four⌋ leave *jajñiṣe*  
unaccented. The majority accent *sphā́tim* in **c**. Ppp. reads in **d**  
*ā dadāti* ⌊*sarasvatīm* (or *-tī*?)⌋.
