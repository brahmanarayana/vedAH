### Translation
10. Riches, fatness of milk, and grain shall Sarasvatī, shall Sinīvālī,  
and this amulet of *udumbára* bring to me.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Both our *pada*-mss. divide in **b** *páyaḥ॰phātim*, but SPP. reports no  
such reading among his three, and gives correctly *páyaḥ॰sph-* (the  
accent is probably false). Our text emends, perhaps unnecessarily, to  
*gáy-*. In **c**, the *pada*-m%s. make the blundering analysis of  
*úpāvahāt* into *úpa:* *avahāt;* SPP. gives, by emendation, *úpa:  
vahāt;* our text emends further to *upā́vahāt* (i.e. *upa॰ā́vahāt*); it is  
uncertain which the comm. favors, but probably the latter: the sole ms.  
has ⌊twice *upāvahāt* and once⌋ *upa vahāt* (probably misreading for  
*upāvahāt*) *upāvahatu*. Ppp. has *upāvahat;* in **b**, it agrees with  
the mss. in reading *payasph-*.
