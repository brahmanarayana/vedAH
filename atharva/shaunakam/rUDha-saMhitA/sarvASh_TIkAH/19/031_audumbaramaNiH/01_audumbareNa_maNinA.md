### Translation
1. With an amulet of *udumbára*, for the pious one desiring prosperity:  
may Savitar make in my cow-stall fatness (*sphātí*) of all cattle.

### Notes
The translation implies in **b** emendation to *vedháse*, which seems  
hardly avoidable. The comm. gives two explanations of *vedhasā: vidhātrā  
purā prayogaḥ. kṛtaḥ;* and *puṣṭyādividhātrā kartrā maṇinā*. Nearly all  
the mss. accent *paśū́nām* (one of ours has *-śūnā́m*), and SPP. passes  
the anomaly without remark.
