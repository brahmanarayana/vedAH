### Translation
2. Whatever householder's fire of ours may be overlord of cattle: let  
the virile (*vṛ́ṣan*) amulet of *udumbára* unite me with prosperity.

### Notes
The connection of the parts of the verse is obscure. The comm. makes  
**b** apodosis to **a**, supplying *asti* in **a**, and taking *ásat*  
optatively—which is extremely implausible. In **d** the mss. read *sá  
mā* (p. *sáḥ: mā*); the comm. divides *sam ā*, with his usual disregard  
of accent (**ā** = *sarvataḥ*); our *sám mā* is an obvious and  
unquestionable emendation, and is also read by Ppp. ⌊See my note to  
xviii. 2. 3, where this case and similar ones are put together, and cf.  
vi. 5. 2.⌋ The mss. further vary between *púṣṭyā* and *puṣṭyā́*, the  
decided majority having the latter.
