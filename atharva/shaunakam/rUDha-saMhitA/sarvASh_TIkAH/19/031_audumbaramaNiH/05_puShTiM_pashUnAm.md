### Translation
5. I have seized all (*pári-*) the prosperity of cattle, of quadrupeds,  
of bipeds, and what grain \[there is\]; the milk of cattle, the sap  
(*rása*) of herbs, may Bṛihaspati, may Savitar confirm to me.

### Notes
Nearly all the mss. accent this time *puṣṭím*.

I have obtained abundant wealth of cattle, bipeds and quad- rupeds, and corn in plenty. Savitar and Brihaspati vouchsafe me the milk of kine and herbs' refreshing juices!
