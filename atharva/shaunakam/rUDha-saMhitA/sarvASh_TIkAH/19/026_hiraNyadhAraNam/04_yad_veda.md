### Translation
4. What king Varuṇa knows, \[what\] divine Bṛihaspati knows, what Indra  
the Vṛitra-slayer knows,—may that be for thee life-giving, may that be  
for thee splendor-giving.

### Notes
Next after the verse already quoted (under vs. 1) from the RV. *khila*,  
occurs another corresponding to this, but having for **b** *yad u devī  
sarasvatī*, and for **d** *tan me varcasa āyuṣe*, and lacking a fifth  
pāda. Ppp. has in **b** *yad u divo bṛh-*, puts *yad* before *indras* in  
**c**, and has for **d**, and for end of the verse, *tac cittaṁ cittam  
arhaṇam*.  
  
⌊Here ends the third *anuvāka*, with 6 hymns and 65 verses.⌋
