### Translation
2. The gold, of beauteous color by the sun, that men (*mánu*) of old  
with their progeny sought—that, shining (*candrá*), shall unite thee  
with splendor; of long life becomes he who wears it.

### Notes
Very nearly all the mss. read *iṣiré* at end of **b**; but both  
editions, and the comm., give *īṣiré*. The majority of mss. also accent  
*pūrvé*. SPP. reads at end of **c** *sṛjati*, with all the authorities  
(save his P., which has *sṛjāti*)\*; both sense and meter so plainly  
call for *sṛjāti* that we adopted it as an emendation in our text; the  
comm. reads *sṛjatu*. As to *bibharti* at the end, see note to vs. i.  
\*⌊W's P.M. have *sṛjasvā ”yu-*.⌋

The men of ancient time with children round them longed for this Gold, bright with the Sun's own colour, This shall endow thee, as it shines, with splendour, and long shall be the life of him who wears it.
