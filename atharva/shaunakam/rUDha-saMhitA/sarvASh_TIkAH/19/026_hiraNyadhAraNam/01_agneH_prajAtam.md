### Translation
1. The gold that, born out of the fire, immortal, maintains itself over  
mortals—whoso knows it, he verily merits (*arh*) it; one that dies of  
old age becomes he who wears (*bhṛ*) it.

### Notes
SPP. accents at the end *bibhárti*, with the great majority of the mss.  
(the same also in 2 **d**); our preference for *bíbharti* was because  
only this accent is found elsewhere in AV. Most of the mss. accent  
*énad* in **c**. The masculine *enam* in **c** is surprising, as no hint  
of anything masculine is met with elsewhere in the hymn; the comm.  
explains it as *anvādiṣṭaṁ hiraṇyarūpam padārtham*. In a corresponding  
verse (6) found in a *khila* of the RV. (to x. 128) is read instead  
*enad* (one ms. *vedam*), which is more likely to be the true text. The  
same has in **b** *jajñe* for *dadhre*. The Anukr. takes no notice of  
the redundant syllable in **c**.

Gold that was born from Fire is immortal hath been deposited with mortal creatures. He who knows this deserves to own this jewel, and in extreme old age dies he who wears it.
