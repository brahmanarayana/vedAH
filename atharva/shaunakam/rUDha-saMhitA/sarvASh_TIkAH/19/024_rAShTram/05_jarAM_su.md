### Translation
5. Go thou safely (*sú*) unto old age; wrap thyself in the garment;  
become thou protector of the people (?) against imprecation; and live  
thou a hundred numerous autumns; and wrap further about (*upa-sam-vyā*)  
thee abundance of wealth.

### Notes
⌊The verse is found in PGS. (i. 4. 12), HGS. (i. 4. 2), and MP. (ii. 2.  
7). In **a**, PGS. omits *sú*, while HGS.MP. have *jarā́ṁ gacchāsi;* in  
**b**, all three texts read *kṛṣṭīnā́m* and *abhiśastipā́vā;* all three  
end **c** with *suvarcās;* and PGS. has for **d** *rayiṁ ca putrān anu  
saṁvyayasva*, adding *āyuṣmatī ’dam paridhatsva vāsaḥ*.⌋ In **b**, the  
translation follows Ppp. ⌊and the three texts just cited⌋ in reading  
*kṛṣṭīnā́m* 'people' instead of the absurd *gṛṣṭīnā́m* 'heifers,' which is  
given by all the mss. and the comm., both here and in the nearly  
accordant verse ii. 13. 3: see note to ii. 13. 3 ⌊and cf. Roth, ZDMG.  
xlviii. 110⌋. The comm. is driven by the reading *gṛṣ-* into taking  
*abhiśasti-* from *śas* 'cut': *abhito viśasanaṁ hiṅsā*. ⌊Our  
*abhiśastipā́ u*, at the end of **b** in vss. 5 and 6, would seem, in  
view of the *-pā́vā* of the other texts, to be a faulty assimilation to  
the end of **d** in vs. 4, *páridhātavā́ u*, such as may be found  
elsewhere.⌋

Advance to good old age: endue the mantle. Be thou our heifers' guard from imprecation. Live thou a hundred full and plenteous autumns, and wrap thee in prosperity of riches.
