### Translation
6. Thou hast wrapped thyself in this garment in order to well-being;  
thou hast become protector of thine allies (?) against imprecation; and  
live thou a hundred numerous autumns; living, pleasant (*cā́ru*), thou  
shalt share out good things.

### Notes
The translation implies in **b** *ábhūr āpīnā́m* ⌊see below⌋, or else an  
analysis of the ms. reading *vāpīnā́m* ⌊misprinted *vap-* in foot-note of  
Berlin ed.⌋ into *u* and *āpīnā́m* (the *pada*-mss. have *ábhūḥ:  
vāpīnā́m*). The *vaśā́nām* of our text\* is a conjecture provoked by the  
*gṛṣṭīnā́m* of vs. 5; as that is got rid of, this naturally falls away  
also. The comm. has again *gṛṣṭīnām*, and this time interprets  
*abhiśasti-* as a fear on the part of the 'heifers' of losing their  
skins (*tvagādānabhīti* ⌊cf. note to ii. 13. 3⌋)! The Ppp. text appears  
to give us no variants. The HGS. has a corresponding verse (in i. 4. 3),  
reading in **a, b** *adhi dhāḥ* ⌊one ms. correctly *’dhithāḥ*⌋ *svastaye  
‘bhūr āpīṇām*† *abhiśastipāvā:* and, for **d**, *vasūni cāyyo vi bhajā  
sa jīvan;* the variant to *cā́rus*, taken in connection with the small  
appropriateness of *cā́rus*, makes its genuineness suspicious. ⌊MP., at  
ii. 2. 8, also has *āpīnā́m;* and it agrees otherwise with HGS., save  
that it has *dhā* for *dhāḥ*, *cāryó* for *cāyyo*, and *ví bhajāsi*  
(agreeing with AV.). Kirste, in his note to HGS., p. 8, mentions as  
further variants *cāyo* and *cārye*. MB., at i. 1. 6, has **c**, ending  
with *suvarcās*, and **d**, reading *cārye*.⌋ \*⌊Misprinted *vaśānā́m*.⌋  
†⌊One ms. correctly *āpīnām*.⌋

Thou for weal hast clothed thee in this garment: thou hast become our cows' sure guard from curses. Live thou a hundred full and plenteous autumns: then living, fair thyself, shalt deal forth treasures.
