### Translation
2. Wrap ye this man \[as\] Indra in order to life-time, to great  
dominion, that \[it\] may conduct him unto old age; may he long watch  
over dominion.

### Notes
All the mss., both here and in the next verse, read at end of **c**  
*nayā́m*, which SPP. therefore accepts, although both form and accent are  
indefensible; the comm. has both times *naya;* the translation implies  
our emendation to *náyāt*, the propriety of which can hardly be  
questioned, especially as it is supported by a corresponding verse three  
times repeated, with variations, in HGS. i. 4. 8: *parī ’mam indra  
brahmaṇe mahe śrotrāya* (or *rāṣṭrāya*, or *poṣāya*) *dadhmasi: athāi  
’naṁ jarimā ṇayej jyok śrotre* (or *rāṣṭre*, or *poṣe*) *adhi jāgarat:*  
of these three forms, the first is intended for a Brahman, the second  
for a Kṣatriya, the third for a Vāiśya: compare our next verse. The  
comm., ⌊in 2 **a** and 3 **a**, appears to have had before him  
*indramāyuṣe* and *somamāyuṣe*, whatever his accentuation and  
*pada*-text may have been: this he understands as *indra mā* *”yuṣe*  
and *soma mā ”yuṣe*, his vocative *indra*⌋ agreeing with HGS. and giving  
an easier and better text; ⌊his *mā* goes easily as an appositive with  
*imám*, but the following *enam* is quite out of joint with it⌋.
