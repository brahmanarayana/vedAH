### Translation
3. Wrap ye this man \[as\] Soma in order to life-time, to great  
instruction (*śrótra*), that \[it\] may conduct him unto old age; may he  
long watch over instruction.

### Notes
It is perhaps only by an accident that vs. 2 is omitted in Ppp.; at any  
rate, this verse shows what would have been read for verse 2 by it; it  
has *somam*, not *soma*, in **a**;\* and *naya*, with the comm., in  
**c**; further, in **a** it gives *pare ’maṁ*. \*⌊Strictly speaking, it  
has *somamāyuṣe*, with a possibility for the same objectionable division  
as appears under vs. 2, which see.⌋

Invest this Soma for long life, invest him for great hearing power. That I may lead him on to eld, that he may watch o'er hearing long.
