### Translation
3. Weal for us be Dhātar, and weal for us Dhartar; weal for us be the  
wide-spreading one (*urūcī́*) with her powers (? *svadhā́*); weal the two  
great firmaments (*ródasī*), weal for us the rock (*ádri*); weal for us  
be the successful invocations of the gods.

### Notes
The mss. write in **b** *urūcī́*, *urucī́*, and *ūrūcī́;* the comm.  
explains it as the earth, *dhartṛ* as Varuṇa, separator (*vidhārayitṛ*)  
of the good and bad, and *svadhā* as *anna;* *adri* he simply glosses by  
*parvata*.

Kind unto us be Maker and Sustainer and the far-reaching One with godlike nature. Auspicious unto us be Earth and Heaven, the Mountain and the Gods' fair invocations.
