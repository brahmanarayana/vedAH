### Translation
10. Weal for us be the rescuing god Savitar; weal for us be the  
outshining dawns; weal for us be Parjanya for our progeny; weal for us  
be the wealful lord of the field (*kṣétra*).

### Notes
The comm. quotes a verse to the effect that some regard Rudra, and some  
Agni, as 'lord of the field.'

Prosper us Savitar, the God who rescues, and let the radiant. Mornings be propitious. Propitious to our children be Parjanya, kind to us be the field's benign Protector!
