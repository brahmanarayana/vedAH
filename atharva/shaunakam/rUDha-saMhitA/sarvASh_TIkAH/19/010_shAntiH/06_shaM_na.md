### Translation
6. Weal for us be god Indra with the Vasus; weal Varuṇa of excellent  
praise ⌊*su-śáṅsa*⌋ with the Ādityas; weal for us healing (*jálāsa*)  
Rudra with the Rudras; unto weal for us let Tvashṭar listen here with  
his spouses (*gnā́*).

### Notes
The comm. declares *jalāṣa* a *sukhanāman*. All the *pada*-mss. have in  
**d** *tváṣṭā: agnā́bhiḥ!* SPP. emends to *gnā́bhiḥ;* the comm. of course  
has *gnābhis* and glosses it with *devapatnībhis*. ⌊As to *suśáṅsa*, cf.  
note to xviii. 3. 16.⌋
