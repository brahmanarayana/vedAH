### Translation
1. Weal for us be Indra-and-Agni, with their aids; weal for us  
Indra-and-Varuṇa, on whom offerings are bestowed; weal Indra-and-Soma,  
for welfare, weal \[and\] profit (*yós*); weal for us Indra-and-Pūshan  
in booty-winning.

### Notes
This verse is found also in VS. xxxvi. 11, which inverts the order of  
pādas **c** and **d**. The comm. takes *indrāgnī* in **a** as vocative  
⌊and says so expressly; but⌋ apparently out of mere carelessness, as he  
does not make any change in the 3d du. verb *bhavatām*.
