### Translation
5. They who follow (*anu-sthā*) the night, and who watch over beings,  
who defend all cattle—they watch over our selves (*ātmán*), they watch  
over our cattle.

### Notes
The mss. accent *jā́grati*\* in **d** and **e**, and in **d** the accent  
might well enough be retained, on the principle of antithesis; SPP.  
gives *jāgrati*, like us. Emendation to *jāgratu* would be decidedly  
welcome in both pādas. Ppp. has considerable variations: for **b**,  
*yeṣu bhūteṣu jāgrabhi*,† and, for **d, e**, *tenā tvam asi jāgratu te  
naṣ paśubhir jāgratu:* corrupt, but supporting our proposed *jāgratu*.  
\*⌊It is very reasonable to suppose that in *jā́grati* at end of **d**  
and **e** we have two cases of assimilation of an original *jāgratu* to  
the *jā́grati* which stands correctly at the end of **b** (cf. note to  
xix. 43. 7), each case being doubly faulty, in respect, namely, of  
accent and of ending.⌋ †⌊In Roth's Collation there is a note which  
perhaps means that Ppp. reads *jāgrati* for *rákṣanti* at end of **c**;  
but I am not at all sure.⌋

They who are followers of Night, and they who watch o'er living things. They who protect all cattle, they keep watch and ward over our lives, over our herds keep watch and ward.
