### Translation
3. Whatsoever flies here, whatsoever that is crawling (*sarīsṛpá*) is  
here, whatsoever creature is on the mountain—from that do thou, O night,  
protect us.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The third pāda is wholly corrupt. All the mss. read *parvatāyāsatvam*  
(p. *párvatāya: sáḥ: tvám*), with some differences of accent  
(*-yāsátvam*, or *-yāsátvám*, or *-yā́sátvám*); and the comm. and SPP.  
(in *saṁhitā*) follow them (SPP. *-yāsátvam;* but in p., by emendation,  
*-tāya: asátvam*, since the comm. so understands). Our text emends to  
*párvaṇy ā́saktam* 'what has fastened on the joint,' which seems  
extremely unsatisfactory. The translation above is perhaps hardly  
better, but it implies a text much closer to the mss.—*párvata* (i.e.  
*-te*, hence *-tay*) *ā́ sattvám;* and so it may pass for what it is  
worth; it is by no means proposed as a definite solution of the  
difficulty. Ppp. has *padvad āsunvan*, which gives no help. Ppp. also  
reads *yadi kim* three times.

Whatever flying thing be here, whatever thing that creeps and. crawls. Whatever fastens on a joint, therefrom do thou protect us, Night.
