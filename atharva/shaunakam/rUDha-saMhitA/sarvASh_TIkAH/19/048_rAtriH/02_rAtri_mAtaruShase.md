### Translation
2. O night! mother! commit thou us to the dawn; let the dawn commit us  
to the day, the day to thee, O shining one (*vibhādvarī*).

### Notes
Compare 50. 7, below\*; also MB. i. 5. 15, where more such commitments  
are given. The comm. reckons the first division of the verse to vs. 1.  
The metrical definition of the Anukr. is mere arithmetic (12 + 10 + 8 =  
30). The *pada*-text, both here and below, leaves *vibhāvari* undivided  
(RV. *vibhā॰vari*). \*⌊Also vi. 107. 1-4.⌋
