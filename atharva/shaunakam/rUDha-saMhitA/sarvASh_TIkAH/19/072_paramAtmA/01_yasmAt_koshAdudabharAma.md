### Translation
1. Out of what receptacle we bore up the Veda, within that do we set it  
down; what is performed \[and\] sacrificed by the heroic might of the  
*bráhman*, with that fervor, O gods, favor ye me here.

### Notes
Some of the mss. accent variously *abharāma* and *vedam;* ⌊Griffith  
renders by 'bunch of grass,' again (as at 68. 1) implying the accent  
*vedám:* but this accent is given only by SPP's S^(m).;⌋ two or three of  
SPP's have *ṛtám* instead of *kṛtám* in **c**; the version in Kāuś. 139.  
26 gives in place of either *adhītam*. Ppp. reads in **a, b** *udbharāmi  
veda tasminn antar va dudhmay enam*.  
  
⌊Here ends the seventh and last *anuvāka*, with 18 hymns (or 14 or 13:  
see introd. to hymn 60, above); and with 55 verses, if we count them as  
they are numbered in the Berlin text. They are summed up as 55 verses by  
certain mss.—No mention of the ending of a *prapāṭhaka* is made in the  
colophon.⌋

Within the chest whence we before extracted the bunch of grass, this do we now deposit. Wrought is the sacrifice by power of Brahma. Through this assist me here, ye God, with Fervour.
