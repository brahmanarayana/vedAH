### Translation
1. Let them (both) go up toward the sun, thy heart-burn (*-dyota*) and  
yellowness; with the color of the red bull, with that we enclose  
(*pari-dhā*) thee.

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **a** *udetām;* its **c** is *yo rohitasya gor varṇas*,  
which construes better with **d**. The abbreviated writing *hṛdyot-* for  
*hṛddyot*- (see my Skt. Gr. §232 **a** ⌊and Roth, ZDMG. xlviii. 102⌋)  
betrays the *pada*-text into dividing *hṛ॰dytotáḥ* (cf. *tád yā́m*, iv.  
19. 6; so even the RV. *pada*-text has *jarat॰víṣam* from *jaraddvíṣam*  
at v. 8. 2). SPP. has properly in his text the unabbreviated form  
*hṛddyo-*. *U'd॰ayatām* in the AV. Index Verborum is an erratum for *úd  
ayatām:* the comm. takes the form, doubtless wrongly, as 3d sing. mid.  
instead of 3d du. active. Kāuś. follows the indication of **c, d**, and  
of 3 **a, b**, by prescribing the use of products of a red cow, hair and  
skin etc., in the healing rite.

As the Sun rises, let thy sore disease and yellowness depart. We compass and surround thee with the colour of a ruddy ox.
