### Comment
The hymn is not found in Pāipp. Though not mentioned as one of the cātanāni by the text of Kāuś., it is added to them by the schol. (8. 25, note). It is once used by itself in a witchcraft ceremony (ābhicārika) for the relief of one frightened, accompanying the tying on of an amulet (26. 26).


### Translations
