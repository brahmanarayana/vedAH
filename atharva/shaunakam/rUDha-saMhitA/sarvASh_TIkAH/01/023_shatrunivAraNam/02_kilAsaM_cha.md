### Translation
2. The leprous spot, what is pale, do thou cause to disappear from  
hence, the speckled; let thine own color enter thee; make white things  
(*śuklá*) fly away.

### Notes
TB. has *na* (*naḥ?*) for *tvāa* and *aśnntām* for *viśatām* in **c**,  
and in **d** *śvetā́ni* for *śuklāni*. The comm. gives *pṛ´thak* for  
*pṛ´ṣat* in **b**, and has the usual support of a small minority of  
SPP's mss.

Expel the leprosy, remove from him the spots and ashy hue: Let thine own colour come to thee; drive far away the specks of white.
