### Translation
3. Dusky is thy hiding-place, dusky thy station (*āsthā́na*); dusky art  
thou, O herb; make the speckled disappear from hence.

### Notes
TB. has the easier reading *niláyanam* in **a**. The comm. again gives  
*pṛthak* in **d**; he holds that the plant here addressed is the indigo  
(*nīlī*).

Dark is the place of thy repose, dark is the place thou dwellest in: Dusky and dark, O Plant, art thou: remove from him each speck and spot.
