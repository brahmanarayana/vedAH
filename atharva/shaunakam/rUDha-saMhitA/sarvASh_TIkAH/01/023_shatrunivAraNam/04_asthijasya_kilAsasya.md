### Translation
4. Of the bone-born leprous spot, and of the body-born that is in the  
skin, of that made by the spoiler (*dū́ṣi*)—by incantation have I made  
the white (*śvetá*) mark disappear.

### Notes
Ppp. has in **c** *dhūṣya;* TB. reads instead *kṛtyáyā;* the comm.  
explains *dūṣi* as *śatrūtpāditā kṛtyā*. Ppp. has at the end *anenaśam*.

I with my spell have chased away the pallid sign of leprosy, Caused by infection, on the skin, sprung from the body, from the bones.
