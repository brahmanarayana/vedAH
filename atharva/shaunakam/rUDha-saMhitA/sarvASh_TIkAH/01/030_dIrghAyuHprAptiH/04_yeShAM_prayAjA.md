### Translation
 4. Whose are the fore-offerings and whose the after-offerings; the  
gods that share the oblation and that eat what is not made oblation of;  
you among whom the five directions are shared out—you do I make sitters  
at the session (*sattrá-*) of this man.

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **d** *tān no 'smāi satrasadhaḥ k-*. The comm. explains  
*ahutā́das* as *baliharaṇādidevās;* in *sattra* he sees nothing more than  
simple *sadana*. Both editions read *satra-*, in accordance with  
universal manuscript usage.

You, claiming Anuyajas or Prayajas, sharers, or not consumers, of oblation, You, to whom heaven's five regions are apportioned, I make companions at his sacred sessions.
