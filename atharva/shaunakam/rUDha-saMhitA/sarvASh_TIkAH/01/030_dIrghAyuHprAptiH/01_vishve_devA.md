### Translation
1. O all ye gods, ye Vasus, protect this man; likewise ye Ādityas, watch  
ye over him; him let not one related (*sánābhi*) nor one unrelated—him  
let not any deadly weapon of men (*pāúruṣeya*) reach.

### Notes
Ppp. has in **b** the false form *jāgrata.* The comm. paraphrases  
*-nābhi* in **c** by *garbhāśaya.* ⌊For the syntax, cf. Caland, KZ.  
xxxiv. 456.⌋

Guard and protect this man, all Gods and Vasus. Over him keep- ye watch and ward, Adityas. Let not death reach him from the hands of brothers from hands of aliens, or of human beings.
