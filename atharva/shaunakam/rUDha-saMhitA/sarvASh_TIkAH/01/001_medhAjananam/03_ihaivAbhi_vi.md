### Translation
3. Just here stretch thou on, as it were the two tips of the bow with  
the bow-string; let the lord of speech make fast (*ni-yam*); in me, in  
myself, be what is heard.

### Notes
Ppp. reads, in **a, b,** *tanū ubhey aratnī*. With the verse is to be  
compared RV. x. 166. 3. Prāt. i. 82 prescribes the *pada*-reading of  
*ā́rtnī॰iva*, and iv. 3 quotes *abhi vi tanu*. ⌊That is, apparently  
(**a**), 'Do \[for me\] some stretching \[or fastening\],' namely, of my  
sacred learning, as also in **c**.⌋

Here, even here, spread sheltering arms like the two bow-ends strained with cord. This let Vachaspati confirm. In me be Knowledge, yea, in me.
