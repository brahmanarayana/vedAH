### Translation
4. Called on is the lord of speech; on us let the lord of speech call;  
may we be united with (*sam-gam*) what is heard; let me not be parted  
with what is heard.

### Notes
Ppp. has, for **b** ff., *upahūto 'haṁ vācaspatyu soṁsṛtena rādhasi  
sāmṛtena vi rādhasi*—badly corrupt. For similar antitheses with *upahū*,  
see AB. ii. 27; VS. ii. 10 b, 11 a. In AA. (ii. 7. 1) is a somewhat  
analogous formula for the retention of what is heard or studied  
(*adīta*): *śrutam me mā pra hāsīr anenā 'dhītenā 'horātrānt saṁ  
dadhāmi.* The Anukr. notes the metrical irregularity of the second pāda.

Vachaspati hath been invoked: may he invite us in reply. May we adhere to Sacred Lore. Never may I be reft thereof.
