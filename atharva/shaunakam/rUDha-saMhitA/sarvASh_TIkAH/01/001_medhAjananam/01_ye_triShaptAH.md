### Translation
1. The thrice seven that go about, bearing all forms—let the lord of  
speech assign to me today their powers, \[their\] selves (*tanū́*).

### Notes
Ppp. reads *paryanti* in **a**, and *tanvam adhyādadhātu me* for **d.**  
MS. combines *trisaptā́s* in **a,** and *tanvò 'dyá* in **d.** The *ṣ* of  
our *triṣapta* is prescribed in Prāt. ii. 98; *vācas p-* is quoted under  
Prāt. ii. 71.  
  
*Trisaptā́s* is plainly used as the designation of an indefinite number,  
= 'dozens' or 'scores.' Supposing *śrutá* to signify one's acquired  
sacred knowledge, portion of *śruti*, it perhaps refers to the sounds  
or syllables of which this is made up. If, on the other hand, *śruta*  
(as in vi. 41. 1) means 'sense of hearing,' the *triṣaptās* may be the  
healthy hearers, old and young (so R.). R. prefers to regard *tanvàs* as  
gen. sing.: *tanvò me* = 'to me'; the comm. does the same; Weber  
understands accus. pl. Read in our edition *bálā* (an accent-sign  
dropped out under *-lā*).  
  
As an example of the wisdom of the comm., it may be mentioned that he  
spends a full quarto page and more on the explanation of *triṣaptās*.  
First, he conjectures that it may mean 'three or seven'; as the three  
worlds, the three *guṇas*, the three highest gods; or, the seven seers,  
the seven planets, the seven troops of Maruts, the seven worlds, the  
seven meters, or the like. Secondly, it may mean 'three sevens,' as  
seven suns (for which is quoted TA. i. 7. 1) and seven priests and seven  
Adityas (TA. i. 13. 3; RV. ix. 114. 3), or seven rivers and seven worlds  
and seven quarters (TB. ii. 8. 3⁸), or seven planets and seven seers and  
seven Marut-troops. Thirdly, it may signify simply thrice seven or  
twenty-one, as twelve months + five seasons + three worlds + one sun  
(TS. vii. 3. 105), or five *mahābhūtas* + five breaths + five  
*jñānendriyas* + five *karmendriyas* + one *antaḥkaraṇa*. At any rate,  
they are gods, who are to render aid. ⌊Discussed by Whitney, *Festgruss  
an Roth,* p. 94.⌋

Now may Vachaspati assign to me the strength and powers of Those Who, wearing every shape and form, the triple seven, are wandering round.
