### Translation
4. The swarthy, uniform-making one \[is\] brought up off the earth; do  
thou accomplish this, we pray; make the forms right again.

### Notes
All our mss. have at the beginning *śāmā́*, and also very nearly all  
SPP's; but the latter very properly admits *śyā-* into his text, it  
being read by the comm. with a couple of mss. that follow him, and being  
found in Ppp. also. Ppp. once more has *surūp-;* it corrupts **b** into  
*pṛthivyābhyarbhavam*, and gives *sādaya* at end of **c**. The phrase  
*idáṁ ū ṣú* is quoted in Prāt. iii. 4 and iv. 98, which prescribe the  
protraction and lingualization, and words of the verse are repeatedly  
cited in the commentary to other rules.
