### Translation
1. Her portion (*bhága*), splendor have I taken to myself, as from off a  
tree a garland; like a mountain with great base, let her sit long with  
the Fathers.

### Notes
Ppp. has for **a** *ahaṁ te bhagam ā dade;* its **b** is defaced; in  
**c** it gives *mahāmūlāi 'va*. The comm. renders *bhagam* by *bhāgyam*,  
here and in the other verse, recognizing no sexual meaning. *Pitṛṣu* he  
renders "in the later \[2 **c, d**\] to be specified houses of father,  
mother, etc.," and all the translators understand it in the same way;  
but it is questionable whether the plural of *pitar* would ever be used  
in this sense; and the repeated mention of Yama later indicates that  
there was at least a double meaning in the expression. Perhaps a girl  
remaining unmarried was called "bride of Yama," i.e. as good as dead,  
and her stay at home compared to that in the other world. ⌊Cf. Antigone,  
816, "I shall be the bride of Acheron," Ἀχέροντι νυμφεύσω.⌋ The Anukr.  
appears to ratify the abbreviated reading *-budhne 'va* in **c**; it  
counts six syllables in **d**.

As from the tree a wreath, have I assumed her fortune and her fame: Among her kinsfolk long may she dwell, like a mountain broadly- based.
