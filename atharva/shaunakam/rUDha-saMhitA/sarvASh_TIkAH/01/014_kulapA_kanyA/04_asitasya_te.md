### Translation
4. With the incantation (*bráman*) of Asita, of Kaśyapa, and of Gaya, I  
shut up (*api-nah*) thy portion (*vulva?*), as sisters do what is within  
a box (*-kóśa*).

### Notes
⌊For the names, see Bloomfield, 255, and AJP. xvii. 403.⌋ *Bhaga*  
perhaps has here a double meaning. Three of our mss. (E.I.H.) with one  
or two of SPP's, read in **c** *antaṣkośám*, against Prāt. ii. 62, which  
expressly prescribes *ḥ*. The comm. treats *antaḥ* and *kośam* as two  
independent words; *antáḥ kóśe* would be a not unacceptable emendation.  
The Anukr. appears to sanction the abbreviation *-kośaṁ 'va.*
