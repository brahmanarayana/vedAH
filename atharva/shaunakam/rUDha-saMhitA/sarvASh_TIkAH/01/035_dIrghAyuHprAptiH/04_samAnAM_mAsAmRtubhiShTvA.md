### Translation
4. With seasons of summers (? *sámā*), of months, we \[fill\] thee, with  
the milk of the year I fill \[thee\]; let Indra-and-Agni, let all the  
gods, approve thee, not bearing enmity.

### Notes
Emendation to *tvā 'ham* at the end of a would rectify both meter and  
construction. Between **c** and **d** the *pada-*text wrongly resolves  
*té 'nu* into *té: ánu* (as again at viii. 2. 21), and the *pada-*mss.  
put the sign of pāda division before instead of after *te;* apparently  
the Anukr. makes the true division ⌊after *te*, accentless⌋. The comm.,  
too, understands *té*. The combination *-bhiṣ ṭvā* is quoted as an  
example under Prāt. ii. 84.  
  
    
The concluding *anuvāka* ⌊6.⌋ has again 7 hymns, with 31 verses; and the  
quoted Anukr. of the mss. says *ekādaśa co 'ttare parā syuḥ.*  
  
Some of the mss. sum the whole book up correctly as 35 hymns, 153  
verses.  
  
Here ends also the second *prapāṭhaka*.

With monthly and six-monthly times and seasons, with the full year's sweet essence do we fill thee, May Indra, Agni, and all Gods together, showing no anger, grant thee what thou wishest.
