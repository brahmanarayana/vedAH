### Translation
2. Not demons, not *piśācás* overcome him, for this is the first-born  
force of the gods; whoso bears the gold of the descendants of Dakṣa, he  
makes for himself long life among the living.

### Notes
VS. (xxxiv. 51) has the verse, reading *tád* for *enam* and *taranti*  
for *sahante* in **a**, accenting *bibhárti* in **c**, and giving  
*devéṣu* for *jivéṣu* in **d**; and it repeats **d** with *manuṣyèṣu*  
instead; and the RV. khila (8, as above) follows it very nearly (but  
*caranti* in **a**, and *dākṣāyaṇā hir-* in **c**). The Anukr. ignores  
the metrical irregularities of **a** and **b**.

This man no fiends may conquer, no Pisachas, for this is might of Gods, their primal offspring. Whoever wears the Gold of Daksha's children hath a long lengthened life among the living.
