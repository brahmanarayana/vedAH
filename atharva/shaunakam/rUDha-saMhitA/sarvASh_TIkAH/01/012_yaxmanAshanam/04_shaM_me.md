### Translation
4. Weal \[be\] to my upper member (*gā́tra*), weal be to my lower, weal  
to my four limbs; weal be to my body.

### Notes
Ppp. has a quite different text: in **a, b**, *te* both times for *me*,  
and *parāya* for *avarāya;* for **c**, *śaṁ te pṛṣṭibhyo majjabhyaḥ ca;*  
in **d**, *tava* for *mama:* the address to a second person is decidedly  
to be preferred. This is found also in the corresponding verse in VS.  
(xxiii. 44) and TS. (v. 2. 12²), with readings in part agreeing further  
with those of Ppp.: *śáṁ te párebhyo gā́trebhyaḥ śám astv ávarebhyaḥ: śám  
asthábhyo majjábhyaḥ śám v astu tanvāì táva:* but TS. has for **d** *śám  
u te tanúve bhuvat.*

Well be it with my upper frame, well be it with my lower parts. With my four limbs let it be well. Let all my body be in health.
