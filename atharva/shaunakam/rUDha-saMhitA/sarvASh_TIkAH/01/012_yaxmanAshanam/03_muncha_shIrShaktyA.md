### Translation
3. Release thou him from headache and from cough—whoever hath entered  
each joint of him; the blast (? *śúṣma*) that is cloud-born and that is  
wind-born, let it attach itself to forest-trees (*vánaspáti*) and  
mountains.

### Notes
Ppp. has *sṛjatām* for *sacatām* in **d**. The comm. takes *kāsás* in  
**a** as nomin., explaining it as *hṛtkaṇṭhamadhyavartī prasiddhaḥ  
śleṣmarogaviśeṣaḥ; vātajā́s* to him is *kāuṣṭhyād vāyor utpannaḥ.* ⌊For  
*śīrṣakti*, see Knauer, *Indogermanische Forschungen, Anzeiger*, vii.  
225; Bloomfield, AJP. xvii. 416; Böhtlingk, *Berichte der sächsischen  
Ges.*, 1897, xlix. 50, who takes it as 'a stiff neck with head awry.'⌋

Do thou release this man from headache, free him from cough which has entered into all his limbs and joints. May he, the child of cloud, the offspring of the wind, the whiz- zing lighting, strike the mountains and the trees.
