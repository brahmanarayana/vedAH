### Translation
6. What in thine entrails, thy (two) groins (? gavīnī́), what in thy  
bladder has flowed together—so be thy urine released, out of thee, with  
a splash! all of it.

### Notes
The comm. reads in **b** (with two or three of SPP's mss., which follow  
him) *saṁśritam.* He explains the *gavīnyāu* as " two vessels (*nāḍī*)  
located in the two sides, affording access to the receptacles of urine."

Whate'er hath gathered, as it flowed, in bowels, bladder, or in groins, Thus let the conduit, free from check, pour all its burthen as of old.
