### Translation
9. As the arrow flew forth, let loose from the bow—so be thy etc. etc.

### Notes
Instead of *parā॰ápatat* in **a**, we should expect *parā॰pátat*, the  
equivalent of a present.  
  
It is easy to reduce this hymn to the substance of four verses, the norm  
of the book, by striking out vss. 2-5, as plainly secondary variations  
of vs. 1, and combining vss. 7-8 (as in Ppp.) into one verse, with  
omission of the sense-disturbing refrain.

Even as the arrow flies away when loosened from the archer's bow, Thus let the burthen be discharged from channels that are checked no more.
