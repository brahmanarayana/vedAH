### Translation
 4. Wherever, O Agni, thou knowest the births of them, of the devourers  
that are in secret, O Jātavedas, them do thou, increasing through  
worship (*bráhman*)—slay of them, O Agni, with hundredfold transfixion.

### Notes
The irregular meter and broken connection of the second half-verse  
suggest possible corruption of the text: cf. *ásurāṇāṁ śatatarhā́n*, TS.  
i. 5. 7⁶. The meter (11 + 11: 9 + 9 = 40) is well enough described by  
the Anukr. if we may take *bārhatagarbha* as meaning *dvibārh-*  
'containing two padas of nine syllables.' ⌊For *-tárham*, cf. *Gram.*  
§995.⌋
