### Translation
2. This man hath come, speaking out; this man do ye welcome; O  
Brihaspati, taking \[him\] into thy control—O Agni and Soma, do ye (two)  
pierce \[him\] through.

### Notes
Ppp. has in **a, b** *stuvānā gama tvaṁ smo 'ta prati;* in **c, d**,  
*vaśe kṛtā 'gnīṣomāv id dhataṁ.* The comm. makes nonsense every time by  
insisting on rendering *stu* by "praise"; here it is *yuṣmān stuvan.*

This one hath come confessing all: do ye receive him eagerly. Master him thou, Brihaspati; Agni and Soma, pierce him through.
