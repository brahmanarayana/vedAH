### Translation
3. Let the sorcerers cry out (*ví-lap*), let the devouring *kimīdíns;*  
then do you, O Agni together with Indra, welcome this our oblation.

### Notes
Ppp. combines, as often, *-dhānā 'tri-*, in **a-b**; and it reads  
*yathā* for *atha* in **c**, and at the end *haryatām*. SPP. reads  
everywhere *attrín*, the theoretically correct form, but never found in  
the mss.

Let Yatudhanas mourn, let all greedy Kimidins weep and wail: And, Agni, Indra, may ye both accept this sacrifice of ours.
