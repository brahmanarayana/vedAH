### Translation
7. Do thou, O Agni, bring hither the sorcerers bound; then let Indra  
with his thunderbolt crush in (*api-vraśc*) their heads.

### Notes
*Api vraśc* (used almost always of the head) is perhaps more nearly 'cut  
open'; Ppp. reads *apa śīrṣā vṛścatu*. In **b**, *úpa baddhā́ṅ* would be  
a more acceptable reading. The Prāt. (ii. 27) quotes *upabaddhāṅ* as the  
first instance in the text of such treatment of final *-ān.* Our text,  
by an error of the printer, reads *bájreṇa* for *váj-* in **c**.
