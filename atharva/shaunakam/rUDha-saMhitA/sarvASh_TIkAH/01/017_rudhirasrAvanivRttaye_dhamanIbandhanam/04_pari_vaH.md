### Translation
4. About you hath gone (*kram*) a great gravelly sandbank (*dhanū́*);  
stop \[and\] be quiet, I pray (*sú kam*).

### Notes
The comm. sees in *dhanū́* only the meaning "bow," and interprets it  
"bent like a bow": namely, a vessel containing the urine; in *sikatās*  
he sees an allusion to the menses, or to gravel in the bladder. Kāuś.  
(26. 10) speaks of sprinkling on dust and gravel as a means of stanching  
the flow of blood; more probably, as Weber first suggested, a bag filled  
with sand was used: in neither case can the menses be had in view. Ppp.  
reads *siktāmayī bunū sthiraś carasthidam*. The third pāda is identical  
with RV. i. 191. 6 **d**; the comm. (as Sāyaņa to the latter) fails to  
recognize the root *il;* and he renders it *prerayata*, as if root *ir*  
were in question.

A mighty rampart built of sand hath circled and encompassed you: Be still, and quietly take rest.
