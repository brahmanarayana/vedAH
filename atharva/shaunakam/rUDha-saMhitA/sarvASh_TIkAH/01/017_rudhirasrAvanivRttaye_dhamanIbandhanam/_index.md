### Comment
Found in Pāipp. xix. (in the verse-order 3, 4, 1, 2). Used once by Kāuś. (26. 10: the quotation appears to belong to what follows it, not to what precedes), in a remedial rite, apparently for stopping the flow of blood (the comm. says, as result of a knife wound and the like, and also of disordered menses).


### Translations
Translated: Weber, iv. 411; Ludwig, p. 508; Grill, 16, 76; Griffith, i. 21; Bloomfield, 22, 257.—Cf. Hillebrandt, Veda-Chrestomathie, p. 46.
