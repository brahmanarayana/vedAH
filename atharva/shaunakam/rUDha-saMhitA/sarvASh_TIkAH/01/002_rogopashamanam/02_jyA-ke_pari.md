### Translation
2. O bow-string, bend about us; make thyself a stone; being hard, put  
very far away niggards \[and\] haters.

### Notes
A bow-string is, by Kāuś. 14. 13, one of the articles used in the rite.  
With **b** compare ii. 13. 4 **b**. Pāda **d** is RV. iii. 16. 5 **d**.  
'Niggard' is taken as conventional rendering of *árāti*. The comm. reads  
*vīḻus*, RV.-wise.

Do thou, O Bowstring, bend thyself around us: make my body stone. Firm in thy strength drive far away malignities and hateful things.
