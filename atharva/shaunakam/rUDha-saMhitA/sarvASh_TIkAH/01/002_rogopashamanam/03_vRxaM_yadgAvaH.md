### Translation
3. When the kine, embracing the tree, sing the quivering dexterous (*ṝ  
ṛbhú*) reed, keep away from us, O Indra, the shaft, the missile.

### Notes
That is, apparently (**a, b**), 'when the gut-string on the wooden bow  
makes the reed-arrow whistle': cf . RV. vi. 67. 11 **c, d**. The comm.  
explains *ṛbhum* as *uru bhāsamānam* (!), and *didyum* as *dyotamānam*,  
which is probably its etymological sense. ⌊Discussed, Bergaigne, *Rel.  
vid.* i. 278 n., ii. 182.⌋

When, closely clinging round the wood, the bowstring sings triumph to the swift and whizzing arrow, Indra, ward off from us the shaft, the missile.
