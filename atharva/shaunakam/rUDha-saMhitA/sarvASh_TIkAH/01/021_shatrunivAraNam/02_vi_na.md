### Translation
2. Smite away, O Indra, our scorners (*mṛ́dh*); put (*yam*) down them  
that fight (*pṛtany*) \[us\]; make go to lowest darkness whoso vexes us.

### Notes
RV. reverses the order of **c** and **d**, and reads *ádharam;* and with  
it agree precisely SV. (ii. 1218) and VS. (viii. 44 **a** et al.); while  
TS. (i. 6. 12⁴) and MS. (iv. 12. 3) have for **c** *adhaspadáṁ tám īṁ  
kṛdhi*. ⌊Cf. MGS. ii. 15. 6 h and p. 155.⌋
