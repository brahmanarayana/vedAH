### Translation
4. Go forward, ye (two) feet; kick (*sphur*) forward; carry to the  
houses of the bestower (*pṛ*); let Indrāṇī go first, unscathed,  
unrobbed, in front.

### Notes
Ppp. has *gṛham* and *vahantu* (yet *pādāu*) in **b**, and, for **d**,  
*jihitvā muktvā pathā.* The comm. reads *ajitā* in **d**; he ingeniously  
quotes from TS. (ii. 2. 8¹) "Indrāṇī is deity of the army" in  
explanation of her introduction here. ⌊Cf. Bergaigne, *Religion  
Védique*, iii. 155 n.⌋
