### Translation
3. The many have not been able together; the few have not ventured on  
\[it\]; like the sprouts (? *ádga)* of a bamboo (*veṇú*) round about,  
unsuccessful \[are\] the malignant ones.

### Notes
The first half-verse in Ppp. is defaced, but apparently its text agreed  
with ours, except that at the end stands *abhi dhṛṣṇuvam.* As the second  
half is wanting, these two pādas probably form one verse with the two  
reported above, under vs. 2. The comm. reads *dādṛśus* at end of **b**,  
and has *udgā iva paritas* in **c**, explaining *udga* etymologically as  
= *śākhā*. The comment to Prāt. iii. 13 quotes *dādhṛṣus*, and that to  
ii. 38 gives *adgās* among its examples; neither *adga* nor *udga*  
appears to be quotable from elsewhere.

Not many have had power enough; the feeble ones have not prevailed, Like scattered fragments of a reed: ne'er are the wicked pros- perous.
