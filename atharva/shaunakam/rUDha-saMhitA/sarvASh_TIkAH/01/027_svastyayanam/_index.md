### Comment
Found in Pāipp. xix. For the use of the hymn with its predecessor by Kāuś., see under 26; it is also reckoned to the svastyayana gaṇa (25. 36, note); and vs. 4 appears by itself near the beginning of the svastyayana ceremonies, in the same rite as hymns 26 and 27.


### Translations
Translated: Weber, iv. 421; Ludwig, p. 517; Griffith, i. 32.—Griffith says the sloughs are to make the travellers invisible to highway robbers, and cites an old English analogue.
