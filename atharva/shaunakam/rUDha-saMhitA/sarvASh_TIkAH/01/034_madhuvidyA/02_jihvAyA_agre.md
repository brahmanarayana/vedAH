### Translation
2. At the tip of my tongue honey, at the root of my tongue honeyedness;  
mayest thou be altogether in my power (*krátu*), mayest thou come unto  
my intent (*cittá*).

### Notes
The second half-verse agrees nearly with that of iii. 25. 5 and vi. 9.  
2, in both of which the *yáthā*, here unexpressed, helps the  
construction (though the accent of *ásas* does not absolutely need it,  
being capable of being viewed as antithetical). Ppp. has for **a**  
*jihvāyā 'gre me madhu*, and for **c, d** *yathā māṁ kāminy aso* (our 5  
**c**) *yaṁ vācā mām anvāyasī.* The comm. explains *madhūlakam* by  
*madhurarasabahulaṁ jalamadhūlakavṛkṣapuṣpaṁ yathā;* he understands the  
plant to be addressed in **c, d**—which is plainly wrong.

My tongue hath honey at the tip, and sweetest honey at the root: Thou yieldest to my wish and will, and shalt be mine and only mine.
