### Translation
1. This plant is honey-(*mádhu*-)born; with honey we dig thee; forth  
from honey art thou engendered; ⌊so⌋ do thou make us possessed of honey.

### Notes
The comm. calls the plant *madhuka,* and uses that form of the name also  
in the quotations from Kāuś. (instead of *madugha, madhugha,* etc.; the  
mss. vary greatly in their readings).

From honey sprang this Plant to life; with honey now we dig thee up. Make us as sweet as honey, for from honey hast thou been pro- duced.
