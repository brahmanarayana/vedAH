### Translation
4. Than honey am I sweeter (*mádhu*), than the honey-plant more honeyed;  
of me verily shalt thou be fond (? *van*), as of a honeyed branch.

### Notes
The majority of our mss. (not Bp. I. E. D.) read here *madhúghāt* in  
**b**, as do also the Prāt. mss. in both places (ii. 5 c; iv. 16 c)  
where the verse is quoted; but at vi. 102. 3 all read *-du-*; SPP. reads  
*-du-* (as does our text), and makes no report of discordance among his  
authorities; the comm. has *-du-*, and derives the word from  
*madhudugha*. All the mss., and both texts, give the unmotived accent  
*vánās* in **c**; the comm. explains the word by *sambhajes*. He again  
regards the plant as addressed in the second half-verse. Ppp. (in viii.)  
has **a** and **b**, with ⌊aham for asmi and⌋ *madhumāṅ* for *madughāt*.

Sweeter am I than honey, yet more full of sweets than licorice: So mayst thou love me as a branch full of all sweets, and only me.
