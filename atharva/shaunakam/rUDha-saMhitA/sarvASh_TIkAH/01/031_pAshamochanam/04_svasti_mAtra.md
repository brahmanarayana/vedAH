### Translation
4. Well-being (*svastí*) be to our mother and father, well-being to  
kine, to creatures (*jágat*), to men (*púruṣa*); all welfare \[and\]  
beneficence (? *suvidátra*) be ours; long may we see the sun.

### Notes
For *jagate* in **b** Ppp- has *uta,* with manifest advantage to both  
meter and sense; and it reads *pū́ruṣebhyas* (with our H.s. m.), and in  
**d** *dṛśeva.* Many of the *saṁhitā-*mss. (including our H. K.) give  
*ṇo* after *pitré* in **a**. The comm. gives three different  
interpretations (taking it always, however, from *vid* and not from  
*dā*) for the ambiguous *suvidátra*. The Anukr. appears to read *no  
'stu* in **c**, and *ji-óg* and *sū́-ri-am* in **d** ⌊rather, *jyóg* and  
*sū́ryam*, so as to make 11 + 11: 11 + 8?⌋. ⌊As *jagat*, see Zimmer, p.  
150.⌋

Well be it with our mother and our father, well be it with our cows, and beasts, and people. Ours be all happy fortune, grace, and favour. Long, very long may we behold the sunlight.
