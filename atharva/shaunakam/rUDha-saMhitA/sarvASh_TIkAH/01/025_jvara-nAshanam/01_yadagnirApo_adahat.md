### Translation
1. As Agni, entering, burned the waters, where the maintainers of duty  
(*dhárma-*) paid acts of homage, there they declare to be thy highest  
birth-place; then do thou, O fever (*takmán*), complaisant, avoid us.

### Notes
The comm. explains pāda **a** in accordance with the ceremonial act  
founded on its mechanical interpretation; **c** ⌊cf. RV. i. 163. 4  
**d**⌋ shows that it is part of the heavenly waters that is intended.  
*Saṁvidvān* (occurring nowhere else) he renders "fully knowing thy  
cause, the fire (or Agni)": the translation takes it as equivalent to  
the not uncommon *saṁvidāna*. *Adahat* he quietly turns into a future:  
"shall burn thee, O fever"! Ppp. reads *aduhat* instead, and in **c**  
combines to *tā "huḥ.* ⌊Cf. Grohmann's interpretation. l.c., 403, 404.⌋
