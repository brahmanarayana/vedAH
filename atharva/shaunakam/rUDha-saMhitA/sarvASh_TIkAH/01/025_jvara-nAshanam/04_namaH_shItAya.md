### Translation
4. Homage to the cold fever, homage I pay to the fierce (*rūrá*) heat  
(*śocís*); to the one that befalls on every other day, on both days, to  
the third-day fever be homage.

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **b** *durāya kṛṇvā vayaṁ te*, and in **c** *ubhayebhyaś  
ca hatas*. The compound *ubhayadyus* is noticed in Prāt. iv. 21. ⌊As for  
rhythmical fevers—tertian, quartan, etc., see Grohmann, l.c., 387, 3S8.⌋
