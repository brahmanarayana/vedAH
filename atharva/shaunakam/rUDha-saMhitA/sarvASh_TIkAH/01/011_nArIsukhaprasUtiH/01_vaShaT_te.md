### Translation
1. At this birth, O Pūshan, let Aryaman \[as\] efficient (*vedhás*)  
invoker utter *váṣaṭ* for thee; let the woman, rightly engendered, be  
relaxed; let her joints go apart in order to birth.

### Notes
The translation of **c** implies emendation of the text to *ví sisṛtām*.  
Roth formerly preferred *sísṛtām nāry ṛtáprajātaḥ* 'let a timely child  
come forth, O woman'; Weber leaves *sísratām* as pl. with indefinite  
subject, and understands the two following words as a parenthesis: "be  
the woman properly constructed"; Ludwig renders as if *sísṛtām;* Roth  
now (as in BR.) would emend only *sísṛtām*, and understand it of the  
'flow' of water preceding birth; but that would be rather *sru*, and  
*sṛ* without a prefix in such a sense seems very unlikely ⌊cf., however,  
*sárann ā́paḥ*, RV. iv. 17. 3⌋. *Ṛtáprajātā* might also be possessive,  
'rightly engendering.' The comm. takes *sū́tāu* as from *sū́ti* ⌊not  
*sūtí*, fem., nor sū́tu, fem.: note accent and gender!⌋, and meaning the  
ceremony at birth; *vedhā́s* as = Dhātar 'the creator'; *ṛtaprajātā* as =  
*jīvad-apatyā;* and *sisratām* (to the plural form of which he finds no  
objection) as "may she be relieved (*viniḥsṛtā*) of the pangs of birth."  
The metrically irregular verse (9 + 10: 10 + 11 = 40) is a *pan̄kti*  
solely in virtue of the ⌊aggregate⌋ number of its syllables.
