### Translation
2. Four \[are\] the directions of the sky, four also of the earth: the  
gods sent together the fœtus; let them unclose her in order to birth.

### Notes
Or 'unclose it,' *tám*, which SPP. reads in text and comm. (the latter  
omits the word itself in the paraphrase) with the minority of his mss.,  
but against all of ours; Weber and Roth prefer *tám*. The word and its  
predecessor are quoted in the Prāt, (ii. 30), as the earliest example in  
the text of a combination of *n* and *t* without inserted *s*; but the  
form of the quotation (*samāirayantādinām*) prevents our seeing whether  
its authors read *tā́m* or *tám;* the comm. gives *tām*. In **d**, the  
comm. gives the false form *ūrṇavantu*. The text in Ppp. is confused,  
but does not appear to intend any variants from our reading.

Four are the regions of the sky, and four the regions of the earth: The Gods have brought the babe; let them prepare the woman for the birth.
