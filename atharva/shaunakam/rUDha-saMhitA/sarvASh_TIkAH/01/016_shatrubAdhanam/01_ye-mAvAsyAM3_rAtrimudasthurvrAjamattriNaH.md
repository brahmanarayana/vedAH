### Translation
1. What devourers, on the night of new moon, have arisen troop-wise  
(?)—the fourth Agni is the demon-slayer; he shall bless us.

### Notes
*Vrājam* in **b** is obscure; 'troopwise' is the conjecture of BR.; the  
comm. reads instead *bhrājam*, and absurdly explains it as *bhrājamānām*  
or *-nam* 'shining,' and qualifying either the night or the "hearty" man  
whom the demons have risen to injure! Ppp. has *turyas* for *turīyas* in  
**c**; what is meant by it is not clear; the comm. gives three different  
explanations: fourth after the death of his three brothers and  
predecessors (quoting for these TS. ii. 6. 6²); as the house-fire apart  
from the three sacrificial; or as the *ān̄girasa* fire, as distinguished  
from the sacrificial, the household, and that of battle—thus teaching us  
nothing but his own ignorance and perplexity. Grill follows Weber in  
understanding the word to mean "powerful." For **d**, Ppp. has *san naḥ  
pātu tebhyaḥ.*

May potent Agni who destroys the demons bless and shelter us. From greedy fiends who rise in troops at night-time when the moon is dark.
