### Translation
2. The lead Varuṇa blesses; the lead Agni favors; Indra bestowed on me  
the lead; it, surely, is a dispeller of familiar demons.

### Notes
Ppp. combines *māi 'ndra p-* in **c**, and has for **d** *amīvāyas tu  
cātam* (for *cātanam*). The comm. ascribes the mention of Varuṇa to the  
fact that river-foam is one of the articles declared (Kāuś. 8. 18)  
equivalent to lead, and here intended by that name. ⌊Cf. Bloomfield,  
JAOS. xv. 158.⌋

Varuna's benison hath blessed the lead, and Agni strengthens it. Indra hath given me the lead: this verily repels the fiends.
