### Translation
4. The antelope-footed, the bull-toothed, the kine-repelling, the  
out-blowing, the licked-out, the pallid—these we make disappear from us.

### Notes
Designations either of the unlucky signs or of the women marked with  
them—probably the former. The comm. prefers the latter, except for the  
two last, which he blunderingly takes from the stems *-ḍhya* and *-mya*,  
and makes them qualify *lakṣma* understood. He explains *goṣedhā* (p.  
*go॰sedhā́m*) as " going like a cow," and *vilīḍha* as a lock " on the  
edge of the forehead, licked as it were the wrong way"—or what is called  
a "cowlick" ⌊Skt. *kākapakṣa.*⌋ Both editions give at the beginning  
*ríśyap-*, instead of the true reading *ṛ́śyap-*, which the comm. (with  
three of SPP's mss.) has; the mss. bungle all the occurrences of this  
word. In part of our edition the *ṁ* is broken off from *vṛ́ṣadatiṁ.*

Antelope-foot, and Bullock-tooth, Cow-terrifier, Vapour-form, The Licker, and the Spotted Hag, all these we drive away from us.
