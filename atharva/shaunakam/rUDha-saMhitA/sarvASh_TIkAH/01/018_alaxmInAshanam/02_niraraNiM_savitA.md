### Translation
2. Savitar has driven out the trouble (? *draṇi*) in her feet; out have  
Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman \[driven\] \[that\] in her hands; out hath  
Anumati, bestowing (*rā*) upon us; the gods have driven this woman  
forward unto good fortune.

### Notes
All the mss. give in **a** *sāviṣak*, which SPP. very properly retains,  
though the comm. and Ppp. have *-ṣat* (see my Skt. Gr.², §151 a);  
'*sāviṣak* (p. *as-*) would be an improvement, and may be understood.  
For **c, d**, Ppp. has *yad ādityāmavatī rarāṇā pṛṇasuvā savitā  
sāubhagāya*. The comm. gives two etymological guesses at *araṇīm* (which  
is his reading, instead of *-ṇim*), both worthless, and describes  
*rarāṇā* as accented on the final. The separation of this verse from the  
others in Ppp. indicates that it probably has nothing to do with  
"marks." It is rather unusual for the Anukr. to take notice of the  
occurrence of a *triṣṭubh* pāda in a *jagatī* verse ⌊**d**, no less than  
**c**, is *triṣṭubh*, pronounce *devāsāviṣuḥ.*⌋

Let Savitar, Mitra, Varuna, and Aryaman drive away Stinginess from both the hands and feet: May Favour, granting us her bounties, drive her off. The Gods created Favour for our happiness.
