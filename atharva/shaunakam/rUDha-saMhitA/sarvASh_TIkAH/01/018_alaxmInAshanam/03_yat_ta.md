### Translation
3. Whatever in thy self, in thy body, is frightful, or what in hair or  
in mien—all that do we smite away with \[our\] words; let god Savitar  
advance (*sūd*) thee.

### Notes
'God Savitar' or 'the heavenly impeller,' everywhere equivalent. Ppp.  
begins *yat tā "tman tanvā ghoram*, and has for **c, d** *tat te vidvāṅ  
upabādhayeṣāṁ pra tvā suvā savitā sāubhagāya*. The metrical description  
of the verse (11 + 11: 10 + 10 = 42) by the Anukr. is unusual and  
questionable.

Each fearful sign upon thy body, in thyself, each inauspicious mark seen in thy hair, thy face, All this we drive away and banish with our speech. May Savitar the God graciously further thee.
