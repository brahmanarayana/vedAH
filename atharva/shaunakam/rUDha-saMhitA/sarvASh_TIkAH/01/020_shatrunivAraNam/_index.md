### Comment
The first three verses are found in Pāipp. xix., and vs. 4 in ii.: see below. For the use of the hymn by Kāuś. with 19 and 21, see under 19. And vs. 1 is used alone (so the comm.) in the parvan-sacrifices (Kāuś. 2. 39), on viewing the cooked oblation.


### Translations
Translated: Weber, iv. 413; Griffith, i. 24.
