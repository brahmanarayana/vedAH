### Translation
3. Both what \[is\] from here and what from yonder—keep off, O Varuṇa,  
the deadly weapon; extend great protection (*śárman*); keep very far off  
the deadly weapon.

### Notes
The *pada* text marks the pāda-division in the first half-verse before  
instead of after the second *yát*. Ppp. reads in **b** *yāvayaḥ*. The  
second half-verse is found again at the end of the next hymn—which is  
perhaps an additional indication that this hymn properly ends here. The  
Anukr. ignores the metrical irregularity of the verse (9 + 8: 7 + 8 =  
32). ⌊Read in **a** *itó yád*, and in **c** *yacha naḥ.⌋*

Ward off from this side and from that, O Varuna, the deadly dart: Give us thy great protection, turn the lethal weapon far away.
