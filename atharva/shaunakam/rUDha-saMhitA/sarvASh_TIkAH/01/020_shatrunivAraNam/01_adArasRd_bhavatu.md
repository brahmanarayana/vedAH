### Translation
1. Let there be the *ádārasṛt*, O god Soma; at this sacrifice, O Maruts,  
be gracious to us; let not a portent find us, nor an imprecation; let  
not the wrong that is hateful find us.

### Notes
The first pāda is rendered on the assumption that the sāman of this  
name, as described in PB. xv. 3. 7, is intended; it might be used of the  
person intended to be benefited: 'let him be one not getting into a  
split (i.e. hole, or difficulty)': this is the sense distinctly taught  
in PB.; the comm. says *na kadācid api svastrīsamīpam prāpnotu*  
(*madīyaḥ śatruḥ*)! The verse occurs in TB. (iii. 7. 5¹²: and repeated  
without change in Āp. ii. 20. 6), with *bhavata* in **a**, *mṛḍatā*  
(without the anomalous accent) in **b**, and *vṛjánā* in **d**. Ppp.  
begins with *adārasur bh-*, adds *ayam* after *soma* in **a**, and has  
in **d** the easier reading *prā "pad duchunā* for *vidad vṛjinā*. The  
second half-verse occurs again as v. 3. 6 **c, d**. Though connected  
with vss. 2, 3 in Pāipp. also, this verse does not appear to have  
anything originally to do with them.

May it glide harmless by in this our sacrifice, O Soma, God! Maruts, be gracious unto us. Let not disaster, let not malison find us out; let not abominable guiles discover us.
