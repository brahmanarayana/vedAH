### Translation
2. What missile (*sénya*) weapon of the malignant (*aghāyú*) shall go up  
today, do ye, Mitra-and-Varuṇa, keep that off from us.

### Notes
The first half-verse in Ppp. is *yo 'dya sāinyo vadho jighāsaṁ nam  
upāyatī*, which is nearly our vi. 99. 2 **a, b**. The half-verse occurs  
also in PB. (i. 3. 3 **a, b**) and AśS. (v. 3. 22 **a, b**), both of  
which have *sāumyas;* PB. elides *yo 'dya;* AśS. gives at the end  
*-trati*. *Aghāyūnā́m* would be the proper accent (and this the comm.  
has), unless the word were understood as feminine.
