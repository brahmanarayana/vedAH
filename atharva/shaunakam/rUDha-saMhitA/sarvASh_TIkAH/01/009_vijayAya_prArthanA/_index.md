Found also in Pāipp. i. Reckoned to the varcasya gaṇa (Kāuś. 13. 1, note), and further used in various ceremonies: by itself, in that of the restoration of a king (16. 27); with i. 35 and v. 28, in two ceremonies for fortune and for power (11. 19; 52. 20); with seven others, employed by a teacher at the reception of a Vedic student (55. 17). In Vāit. (3. 1), vs. 3 accompanies an oblation to Agni in the parvan-sacrifices. And the comm. quotes its use in the Nakṣ. Kalpa 17-19, in two mahśānti ceremonies called āirāvatī and bārhaspatī; and in Pariśiṣṭa 5. 3, in the puṣpābhiṣeka rite.
