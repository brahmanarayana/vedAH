### Translation
3. With what highest worship (*bráhman*), O Jātavedas, thou didst bring  
together draughts (*páyas*) for Indra, therewith, O Agni, do thou  
increase this man here; set him in supremacy (*śrāíṣṭhya*) over his  
fellows (*sajātá*).

### Notes
Ppp. reads *uttareṇa* in **b**, and its **d** is *rāyas poṣaṁ śrāiṣṭhyam  
ā dhehy asmāi.* The verse is found also in TS. (iii. 5. 4²), MS. (i. 4.  
3), and K. (v. 6). Both TS. and MS. read *havíṣā* for *bráhmanā* in  
**b**, and *agne tvám utá* (for *tvám agna ihá*) in **c**; and MS. has  
*-bharan* in **a**, *vardhayā mā́m* in **c**, and *mā* for *enam* at the  
end; and it inserts *mádhye* before *śrāíṣṭye* in **d**.
