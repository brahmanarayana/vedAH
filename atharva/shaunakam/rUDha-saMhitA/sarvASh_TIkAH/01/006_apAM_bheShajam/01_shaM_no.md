### Translation
1. Be the divine waters weal for us in order to assistance, to drink;  
weal \[and\] health flow they unto us.

### Notes
The verse occurs further, without variants, in VS. (xxxvi. 12), TB. (i.  
2. 1¹ et al.), TA. (iv. 42. 4), and Āp. (v. 4. 1); in SV. (i. 33) is  
repeated *śáṁ nas* (instead of *ā́pas*) at beginning of **b**. The comm.  
explains abhiṣṭi by abhiyajana!  
  
As to the prefixion of this verse to the whole text in a part of our  
mss., see p. cxvi.
