### Translation
4. Weal for us the waters of the plains, and weal be those of the  
marshes, weal for us the waters won by digging, and weal what are  
brought in a vessel; propitious to us be those of the rain.

### Notes
Pādas **a—d** are nearly repeated in xix. 2. 2.  
  
    
The mss. sum up this *anuvāka* ⌊1.⌋ or chapter as of 6 hymns, 29 verses;  
and their quoted Anukr. says *ādyaprathama ṛco nava syur vidyāt:* i. e.  
the verses exceed by 9 the assumed norm of the chapters, which is 20.  
⌊Regarding *vidyāt*, see end of notes to i. 11.⌋

The Waters bless us, all that rise in desert lands or marshy pools! Bless us the Waters dug from earth, bless us the Waters brought in jars, bless us the Waters of the Rains!
