### Comment
The hymn is not found in Pāipp., but perhaps stood at the beginning of its text, on the lost first leaf: see ⌊Bloomfield's introd. to the Kāuś., p. xxxvii and ref's, esp. Weber, v. 78 and xiii. 431⌋. Verses 1-3 occur in RV., as noted under the preceding hymn, and 1-2 in other texts, as pointed out under the verses. For the use of the hymn, with its predecessor or its two predecessors, in Kāuś. and Vāit., see above, under those hymns. Verse 1 is also (Kāuś. 9. 7) directed to be repeated (with the gāyatrī or sāvitrī-verse) at the beginning and end of śānti rites, and to be recited part by part six times, with rinsing of the mouth, in the indramahotsava ceremony (140. 5).
