### Translation
4. Thou whom all the gods did create, the bold one, ⌊\[the gods\]⌋  
making an arrow for hurling—do thou, besung in the council (*vidátha*),  
be merciful to us; to thee as such be homage, O goddess.

### Notes
*Dhṛṣṇum* in **b** might qualify *íṣum* directly. The comm. supplies *he  
aśane* 'O thunderbolt' as addressed. He reads *mṛla* in **c**. Ppp.  
reads for **a, b** *yaṁ tvā devā ajanayanta viśveṣāṁ kṛnvānā aśanāya  
triṣvāi;* and for **d** *mitrasya varuṇasya prasṛṣṭāu*. The Anukr. seems  
to scan as 10 + 11: 10 + 9 = 40 syllables. ⌊Read in **c** *mṛḍaya* and  
in **d** *utá tásyāi?*—For *vidátha*, see discussions of Bloomfield,  
JAOS. xix.² 17, and Geldner, ZDMG. lii. 757; and the literature cited by  
Foy, KZ. xxxiv. 226.⌋
