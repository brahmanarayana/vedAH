### Translation
3. May ye, issue (*nápāt*) of the height, sun-skinned Maruts, yield us  
breadthful protection.

### Notes
The mss. all read at the end *sapráthās*, and SPP. retains it in his  
text; the comm. has *saprathas,* in accordance with our emendation. ⌊Cf.  
Lanman, *Noun-Inflection,* p. 560.⌋ The comm. further has *yacchāta* in  
**c**.
