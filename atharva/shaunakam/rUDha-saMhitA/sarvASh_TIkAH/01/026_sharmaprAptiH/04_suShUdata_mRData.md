### Translation
4. Do ye advance \[us\], be gracious; be thou gracious to our selves  
(*tanū́*), show kindness (*máyas*) to our offspring (*toká*).

### Notes
Ppp. fills up the deficiency of **a**, reading *su mṛḍatā suṣúdatā mṛḍā  
no aghābhyaḥ stokāya tanve dā* (perhaps defective at the end). The mss.,  
supported by the Anukr., make no division of the verse before *máyas*,  
and SPP. follows them; the meter, however, is plainly *gāyatrī*. The  
name given by the Anukr. is not used by it elsewhere; it doubtless  
signifies, as in the VS. Anukr., 7 + 7 + 7 = 21 syllables, the  
resolution *-bhi-as* being refused in **b** and **c**.
