### Translation
4. With propitious eye behold me, O waters; with propitious body touch  
my skin; they that are ghee-dripping, clean, purifying—let those waters  
be weal, pleasant to us.

### Notes
The first half-verse appears again below as xvi. 1. 12. It alone is  
found in TS. and MS.; but our **c** is RV. vii. 49. 3 **c**, and the two  
other texts have it after our 2 **a, b** ⌊all reading *madhu-* for  
*ghṛta-*⌋. MP. reads *śivéna tvā cákṣuṣā paśyantv ā́paḥ*, and in **b**  
*spṛśantu* and *te*. AB. (viii. 6. 10) quotes the whole verse in its TS.  
and MS. version. Our Bp. K. read *-ścyutas* in **c**; Ppp. has  
*-ścantas.* The Anukr, ignores the redundancy of one syllable (or more)  
in **b**.

Ye Waters, with auspicious eye behold me: touch ye my skin with your auspicious body. May they, the bright and pure, distilling fatness, those Waters, bring felicity and bless us.
