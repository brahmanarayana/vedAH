### Translation
 3. They of whom the gods in heaven make \[their\] draught (*bhakṣá*);  
they that come to be abundantly in the atmosphere; who, of beauteous  
color, etc. etc.

### Notes
Again TS. MS. have a different **c** (*yā́ḥ pṛthivī́m páyaso 'ndáanti  
śukrā́ḥ*). Our O. has at end of **c** *vírupāḥ* (as TS. MS. in 1 **c**).  
MP. substitutes *níviṣṭās* for *bhavantī* in **b**. The comm. renders  
*bhakṣám* by *upabhogyam*.

Whom the Gods make their beverage in heaven, they who wax manifold in air's mid-region, They who took Agni as a germ, fair-coloured,--those Waters bring felicity and bless us!
