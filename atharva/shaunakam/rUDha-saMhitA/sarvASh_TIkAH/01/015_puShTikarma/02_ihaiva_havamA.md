### Translation
2. Come straight hither to my call, hither ye confluents also; increase  
this man, ye songs; let every beast (*paśú*) there is come hither; let  
what wealth (*rayí*) there is stay (*sthā*) with him.

### Notes
The *pada*-mss. all give *yā́ḥ* in **e**. Ppp. has in **a, b** *idaṁ  
havyā ttpetane 'daṁ*, and, for **c**, *asya vardhayato rayim*. The last  
pāda is nearly RV. x. 19. 3 **d**. ⌊Render 'with this man let' etc.⌋ The  
omission of *evá* in **a** would make the verse regular.
