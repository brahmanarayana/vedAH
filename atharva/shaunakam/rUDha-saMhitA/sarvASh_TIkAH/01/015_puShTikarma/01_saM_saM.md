### Translation
1. Together, together let the rivers flow, together the winds, together  
the birds (*patatrín*); this my sacrifice let them enjoy of old; I offer  
with a confluent (*saṁsrāvyà*) oblation.

### Notes
The verse is nearly identical with xix. 1. 1, and in less degree with  
ii. 26. 3. From xix. 1. 3 **c** it may be conjectured that we should  
read *pradíśas* in **c**. ⌊If we do read *pradívas*, why not render it  
by 'continually'?⌋ Ppp. has not the second half-verse, but instead of it  
vs. 3 **c, d**. For **b** Ppp. gives *saṁ vātā divyā uta.* The comm.  
accents *sáṁ-sam* in **a**. There is perhaps some technical meaning in  
*saṁsrāvyà*. 'confluent' or 'for confluence' which we do not appreciate,  
but it is also unknown to the comm., who explains the word only  
etymologically. The verse is an *āstārapan̄kti* (strictly *virāj:* 8 + 8:  
11 + 11 = 38), and its definition as such is perhaps dropped out of the  
Anukr. text (which reads *ādyā dvitīyā bhurik* etc.).
