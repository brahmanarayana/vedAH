### Translation
 3. What fountains of the streams flow together, ever unexhausted, with  
all those confluences we make riches (*dhána*) flow together for me.

### Notes
Ppp. has in **a, b** *ye nadībhyas saṁsravanty ucchāmas saram akṣikā.*  
The comm. gives the verse twice, each time with a separate explanation.

All river founts that blend their streams for ever inexhaustible-- With all these confluent streams of mine we make abundant riches flow.
