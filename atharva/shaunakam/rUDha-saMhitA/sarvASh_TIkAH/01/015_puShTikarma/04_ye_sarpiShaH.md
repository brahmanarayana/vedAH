### Translation
4. What \[fountains\] of butter (*sarpís*) flow together, and of milk,  
and of water, with all those confluences we make riches flow together  
for me.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *saṁsrāvās* for *sarpiṣas* in **a.** The comm. supphes first  
*avayavās* as omitted subject in the verse, but afterwards *utsāsas*  
from vs. 3, which is of course right.
