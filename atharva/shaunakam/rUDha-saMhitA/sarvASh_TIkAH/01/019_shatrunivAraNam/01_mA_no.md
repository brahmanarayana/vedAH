### Translation
1. Let not the piercers find us, nor let the penetraters find \[us\];  
far from us make the volleys (*śaravyā̀*) fly, dispersing, O Indra.

### Notes
Ppp. combines *mo 'bhi-* in **b**. The rendering of *śaravyā* follows  
the comm., here and to vs. 3 (*śarasaṁhati*).

Let not the piercers find us, nor let those who wound discover us. O Indra, make the arrows fall, turned, far from us, to every side.
