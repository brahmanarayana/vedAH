### Translation
3. Whether one of our own or whether a stranger, fellow or outsider,  
whoso assails (*abhi-dās*) us—let Rudra with a volley pierce those my  
enemies.

### Notes
Ppp's version is somewhat different: *yas samāno yo 'samāno 'mitro no  
jighāṅsati: rudraś śavyā tān amitrān vi viddhata*. With **a, b** compare  
RV. vi. 75. 19 **a, b:** *yó naḥ svó draṇo yáś ca níṣṭyo jíghāṅsati* (=  
SV. ii. 1222 **a, b**, which combines *svó 'raṇo*); the latter half of  
this verse is our 4 **c, d**. Two or three of our mss. (P.M.O.p.m.)  
follow RV. in omitting *yó* after *svó*. Āp. iv. 16. 1 has *yo naḥ  
sapatno yo 'raṇo marto 'bhidāsati devāḥ*, with a wholly different second  
half. The comm. absurdly explains *niṣṭyas* as *nirgatavīryo  
nikṛṣṭabalaḥ śatruḥ.*

Whoever treateth us as foes, be he our own or strange to us, a kinsman or a foreigner, May Rudra with his arrows pierce and slay these enemies of mine.
