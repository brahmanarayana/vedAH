### Translation
2. Dispersing from us let the shafts fly, those that are hurled and that  
are to be hurled; ye divine arrows of men (*manuṣyà-*), pierce my  
enemies.

### Notes
The comm. inserts an "and" in **c**: "divine and human arrows"; this is  
possible, but opposed by the accent. Ppp. has for **c, d**: *devā  
manuṣyā ṛṣayo 'mitrān no vi viddhatu;* the comm. also reads *vidhyatu*.

Turned from us let the arrows fall, those shot and those that will be shot. Shafts of the Gods and shafts of men, strike and transfix mine enemies:
