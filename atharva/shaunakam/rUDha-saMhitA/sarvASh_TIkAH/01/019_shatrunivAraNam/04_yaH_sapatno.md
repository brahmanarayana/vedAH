### Translation
4. Whatever rival (*sapátna*), whatever non-rival, and whatever hater  
shall curse us, him let all the gods damage (*dhūrv*); incantation  
(*bráhman*) is my inner defense.

### Notes
Ppp. has as first half-verse *sabandhuś cā 'sabandhuś ca yo na indrā  
'bhidāsati.* The second half-verse is found, without variant, in RV.  
(and SV.: see under vs. 3). The comm. explains *sapatna* well as  
*jñātirūpaḥ śatruḥ*. SPP. follows the very bad example of a part of his  
mss. by reading *dviṣan ch-* (instead of *-añ* or *-aṅ*) in **b** ⌊cf.  
i. 33. 2, ii. 4. 6, and see Prāt. ii. 10, 17, and especially 11.—The  
*pada*-text reads *dviṣán*⌋.

The rival and non-rival, he who in his hatred curses us May all the deities injure him! My nearest, closest mail is prayer.
