### Translation
4. I release thee out of the universal, the great flood (*arṇavá*);  
speak, O formidable one, unto \[thy\] fellows here, and reverence our  
incantation (*bráhman*).

### Notes
'Universal' (*vāiśvānara*), i.e., perhaps, dangerous to all men; and the  
dropsy, Varuṇa's special infliction, is probably spoken of as 'flood'  
⌊cf. RV. vii. 89. 4⌋. The (doubtful) rendering of the second half-verse  
takes it as addressed, like the first, to the patient; the comm. regards  
it as said to Varuṇa, which is not impossible. ⌊See Geldner, ZDMG. lii.  
733.⌋ Ppp. reads *amuñcam* at the beginning, and has a *lacuna* in place  
of **c, d**. ⌊Render *apa-ci* by 'regard'?⌋

I free thee from Vaisvanara, from the great surging flood of sin. Call thou thy brothers, Awful One! and pay attention to our prayer.
