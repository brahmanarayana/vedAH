### Translation
1. This Asura bears rule over the gods; for the wills (*váśa*) of king  
Varuṇa \[come\] true; from him, prevailing by my worship (*bráhman*),  
from the fury of the formidable one (*ugrá*) do I lead up this man.

### Notes
'Come true,' i.e. are realized or carried out: the more etymological  
sense of *satyá*. Ppp. reads *viśāya* for *vaśā hi*. The comm. explains  
*śāśadāna* as "exceedingly sharp; having attained strength by favor of  
Varuṇa, gratified by praise etc." *Tatas pari* in **c**, as the first  
example of its kind of combination, is quoted in Prāt. ii. 66. The  
Anukr. ignores the first pāda as a *jagatī*.

This Lord is the Gods' ruler; for the wishes of Varuna the King must be accomplished. Therefore, triumphant with the prayer I utter, I rescue this man from the Fierce One's anger.
