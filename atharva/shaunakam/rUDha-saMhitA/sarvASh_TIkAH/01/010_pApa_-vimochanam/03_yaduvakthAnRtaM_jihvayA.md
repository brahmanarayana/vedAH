### Translation
3. In that thou hast spoken with the tongue untruth, much wrong—from the  
king of true ordinances (*-dhárman*), from Varuṇa, I release thee.

### Notes
⌊Read *yát tvám uváktha ánṛtam?*⌋ The comm. has in **a** the absurd  
reading *uvakta*, treating it as for *uvaktha*, which all the mss. give.

Whatever falsehood thou hast told, much evil spoken with the tongue, I liberate thee from the noose of Varuna the righteous King.
