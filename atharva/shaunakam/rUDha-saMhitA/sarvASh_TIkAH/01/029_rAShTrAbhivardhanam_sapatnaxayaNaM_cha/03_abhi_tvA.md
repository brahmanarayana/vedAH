### Translation
3. Thee hath god Savitar, hath Soma made to increase, thee have all  
existences (*bhūtá*) \[made to increase\], that thou mayest be  
over-rolling.

### Notes
The connection is again spoiled in our text by the substitution of  
*avīvṛdhat* in **b** for *avīvṛtat* (which is read by RV. x. 174. 3);  
with the former it is impossible to render the prefix *abhi.* This time  
Ppp. gives *abhībhṛśat* instead, doubtless a mere corruption.

Soma and Savitar the God have strengthened and exalted thee: All elements have aided thee, to make thee general conqueror.
