### Translation
5. Up hath gone yon sun, up this spell (*vácas*) of mine, that I may be  
slayer of foes, without rivals, rival-slayer.

### Notes
RV. X. 159. 1 **a, b** is to be compared (**b** reading *úd ayám māmakó  
bhágaḥ*); Ppp. appears to mix the versions of **b**, giving,  
ungrammatically, *ayam* with *vacas.* ⌊Cf. also MP. i. 16. 5.⌋
