### Translation
1. With an over-rolling amulet (*maṇí*), wherewith Indra  
increased—therewith, O Brahmaṇaspati, make us increase unto royalty  
(*rāṣṭrá*).

### Notes
*Abhi*, literally 'on to,' so as to overwhelm. Our version spoils the  
consistency of the verse by reading *-vāvṛdhé* and *vardhaya* in **b**  
and **d** for RV. (x. 174. i) *-vāvṛte* and *vartaya*, which Ppp. also  
gives (Ppp. *vartayaḥ*). Ppp. further has *imam* for *asmān* in **c**.  
RV. reads *havíṣā* for *maṇínā* in **a**. The long *ī* of *abhīvarta*  
(p. *abhi॰v-*) is noted by Prāt. iii. 12.
