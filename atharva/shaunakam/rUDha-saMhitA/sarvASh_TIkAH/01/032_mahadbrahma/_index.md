### Comment
Found in Pāipp. i., next after our hymn 31. Used by Kāuś. in a women's rite (34. 1), against barrenness, and again (59.3) in a ceremony for prosperity, to heaven and earth; and the first verse (so the comm.) further (6. 17), as alternate to x. 5. 23, with conducting water into the joined hands of the sacrificer's wife, in the parvan-sacrifices.


### Translations
Translated: Weber, iv. 426; Ludwig, p. 533; Griffith, i. 36.
