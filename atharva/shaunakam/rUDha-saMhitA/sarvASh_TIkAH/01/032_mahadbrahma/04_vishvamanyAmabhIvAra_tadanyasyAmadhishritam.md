### Translation
4. The one hath covered all; this rests upon the other; both to the  
heaven and to the all-possessing earth have I paid homage.

### Notes
The first pāda is translated according to the Ppp. version: *viśvam anyā  
'bhi vavāra;* which is quite satisfactory; Weber had suggested *abhī̀ 'vā́  
"ra.* The *pada*-reading is *abhi॰vā́ra*, and the word is quoted under  
Prāt. iii. 12 as an example of a compound showing protraction of the  
final vowel of the first member. TB. (iii. 7. 10³) and Āp. (ix. 14. 2)  
have the verse, and both have *anyā́ 'bhivāvṛdhé.* The comm. gives  
*abhīvāras,* and explains it in three ways, as *abhito varaṇaṁ  
chādanam,* as *abhivṛtam,* and as *abhitaḥ sambhajanayuktam.* For **b**,  
Ppp. has *viśvam anyasyām adhi śratam.* For *viśvávedase* in **c** (Ppp.  
*viśvavedhase;* TB. Āp. *viśvákarmaṇe*) the comm. also gives two  
interpretations, from *vid* 'acquire' and from *vid* 'know.'

This All hath compassed round the one, and on the other lies at rest. To Earth and all-possessing Heaven mine adoration have I paid.
