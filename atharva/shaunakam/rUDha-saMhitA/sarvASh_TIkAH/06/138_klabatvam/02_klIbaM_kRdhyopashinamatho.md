### Translation
2. Do thou make him impotent, *opaśá*-wearing, likewise make him  
*kurī́ra*-wearing; then let Indra with the (two) pressing-stones split  
both his testicles.

### Notes
Ppp. gives *kṛtvā* for *kṛdhi* in **a** (combining *kṛtvo ’p-*), and  
reads throughout *klīva* and *opaśu;* in **c, d** it has *ubhābhyām asya  
gr. indro bhinaitv ā*. The comm. explains *kurīra* as = *keśa*, and  
quotes from TS. iv. 1. 5³ the phrase *sinīvālī́ sukapardā́ sukurīrā́  
svāupaśā́;* and also, from an unknown source, *stanakeśavatī strī syāl  
lomaśaḥ puruṣaḥ smṛtaḥ*.

Make him a eunuch with a horn, set thou the crest upon his- head. Let Indra with two pressing-stones deprive him of his manly strength.
