### Translation
3. Impotent one, I have made thee impotent; eunuch (*vádhri*), I have  
made thee eunuch; sapless one, I have made thee sapless; the *kurī́ra*  
and the *kúmba* we set down upon his head.

### Notes
The comm. explains *kurīra* here as 'a net of hair' (*keśajāla*) and  
*kumba* as 'its ornament' (*tadābharaṇam*), and he quotes from ĀpśS. x.  
9. 5 the sentence *atra patnīśirasi kumbakurīram adhy ūhate*. Both words  
plainly signify some distinctively womanish head-dress or ornament. Ppp.  
reads (as also our P.s.m.) *kumbham* in **e**; and, for **c**, *arasaṁ  
tvā ’karam arasā ’raso ’si*.

I have unmanned thee, eunuch! yea, impotent! made thee- impotent, and robbed thee, weakling! of thy strength. Upon his head we set the horn, we set the branching ornament.
