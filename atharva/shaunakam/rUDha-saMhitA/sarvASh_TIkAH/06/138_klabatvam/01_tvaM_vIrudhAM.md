### Translation
1. Thou art listened to, O herb, as the most best of plants; make thou  
now this man for me impotent (*klībá*), *opaśá*-wearing.

### Notes
The *opaśá* is some head-ornament worn distinctively by women (comm.  
*strīvyañjanam*). Geldner holds that *opaśa*, *kurīra* (vs. 2), and  
*kumba* (vs. 3) all mean alike 'horn.' Ppp. reads *pāuruṣam* in **c**.  
The comm. does not attempt to identify the plant addressed.

O Plant, thy fame is spread abroad as best of all the herbs that grow. Unman for me to-day this man that he may wear the horn of hair.
