### Translation
2. Auspicious day ours at noon, auspicious day be ours at evening,  
auspicious day ours in the morning of the days; be night auspicious day  
for us.

### Notes
That is, may each of these times be free from omens and influences of  
ill-luck. The Ppp. version runs thus: *bh. astu nas sāyaṁ bh. prātar  
astu naḥ: bh. asmabhyaṁ tvaṁ śakadhūma sadā kṛṇu* (as in the appendix to  
the Nakṣatra-kalpa just cited).
