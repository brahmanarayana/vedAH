### Translation
4. Thou who hast made auspicious day for us at evening, by night, also  
by day—to thee as such, O *śakadhū́ma*, king of the asterisms, \[be\]  
always homage.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *akarat* at end of **a**, and *prātar* for *naktam* in **b**.  
All the mss. leave *akaras* unaccented, and SPP. accordingly gives  
*akaras*. in his text; ours emends to *ákaras*.  
  
One may conjecture that it is the Milky Way, which is not unlike a thin  
line of smoke drawn across the sky, that is the real king of the  
asterisms, and that its imitation by a column of the heavy smoke of  
burning dung is what was relied on to counteract any evil influences  
from the asterisms; or the behavior of such smoke, as rising upward or  
hanging low, may have been really a weather-sign.
