### Translation
3. Thou art daughter of the Asuras; thou, the same, art sister of the  
gods; arisen from the sky, from the earth, thou hast made the poison  
sapless.

### Notes
Ppp. omits *sā* in **b**, and reads *jajñiṣe* instead of *sambhatā* in  
**c**. The second pāda is found also as v. 5. 1 **d**. The comm. has, in  
**d**, *cakarṣa* instead of *cakartha;* he regards earth from the  
ant-hill (*valmīkamṛttikā*) as addressed in the verse.
