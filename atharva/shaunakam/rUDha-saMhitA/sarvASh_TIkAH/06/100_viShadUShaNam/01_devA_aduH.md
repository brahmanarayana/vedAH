### Translation
1. The gods have given, the sun has given, the sky has given, the earth  
has given, the three Sarasvatīs have given, accordant, the  
poison-spoiler.

### Notes
Ppp. combines *devā ’duḥ* in **a**, and has *sarvās* instead of *tīsras*  
in **c**. The comm. renders the first verb correctly, by *dattavantas*,  
but the others as imperatives.

The Gods and Surya gave the gift, the Earth and Heaven best- owed the boon. The three Sarasvatis in full accord bestowed the antidote.
