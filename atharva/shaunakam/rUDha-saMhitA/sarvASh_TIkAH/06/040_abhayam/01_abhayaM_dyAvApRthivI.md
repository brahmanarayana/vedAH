### Translation
1. Let fearlessness, O heaven-and-earth, be here for us; let Soma,  
Savitar, make us fearlessness; be the wide atmosphere fearlessness for  
us; and by the oblation of the seven seers be there fearlessness for us.

### Notes
In **d**, *saptarṣīṇām* is read by one or two mss. Ppp. has only the  
first pāda of this verse. Neither vs. 1 nor vs. 2 is a good *jagatī;*  
easy emendations would make both good *triṣṭubh*.

Here may we dwell, O Heaven and Earth, in safety. May Savitar and Soma send us safety. Our safety be the wide air: ours be safety through the oblation of the Seven Rishis.
