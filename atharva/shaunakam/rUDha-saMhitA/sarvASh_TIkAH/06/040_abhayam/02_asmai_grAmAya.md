### Translation
2. For this village \[let\] the four directions—let Savitar make for us  
sustenance, well-being, welfare; let Indra make for us freedom from  
foes, fearlessness; let the fury of kings fall on (*abhi-yā*) elsewhere.

### Notes
Ppp. rectifies the redundancy of **b** by reading *subhūtaṁ savitā  
dadhātu;* in **c**, it reads *aśatrum* and omits *nas;* for **d**, it  
has *madhye ca viṣāṁ sukṛte syāma*. The comm. reads *aśatrus* in **c**.

May the Four Quarters give this hamlet power: Savitar favour us and make us happy! May Indra make us free from foes and danger: may wrath of Kings be turned to other places.
