The first two verses are found also in Pāipp. i., much altered. Used, according to Kāuś. (59. 26), by one who desires absence of danger, with vi. 48, with worship or offering to the seven seers in as many directions; and Keśava and the comm. regard it as further intended by 16. 8, in a rite for courage in an army; vss. 1, 2 are reckoned (note to 16. 8) to the abhaya gaṇa, and vs. 3 (note to 25. 36) to the svastyayana gaṇa; the comm. notes its application according to 139. 7 in the rite for one beginning Vedic study.
