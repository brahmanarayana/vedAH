### Translation
3. O lord of borers, lord of *vághā's!* with arid jaws do ye (pl.)  
listen to me: what devourers (*vyadvará*) there are of the forest, and  
whatever devourers ye are, all them do we grind up.

### Notes
In *vyadvarā́s*, some of our mss. blunder the *dv* into *ddh* or *dhv*,  
even *ddhv;* but most of them, with all SPP's authorities save one, have  
*vyadvarā́s*, which is accordingly, doubtless with reason, admitted by  
SPP. into his text as the true reading, and our *vyadhv-* is to be  
corrected accordingly. ⌊For *vy-advará, vy-ádvarī*, see note to iii. 28.  
2. But at HGS. ii. 16. 5 we have *vyadhvara* with *maśaka;* cf. note to  
ii. 31. 4.⌋ Some mss. appear to read *vaṭyāpate* in **a**, but SPP.  
gives *vaghā-* as supported by all his authorities, and the comm. also  
has it, giving it a fictitious etymology from *ava-han;* he explains it  
by *patan̄gādi*. Pāda **b** is redundant, unless we contract *-bhā́  
”śṛṇota*.

Hearken to me, lord of the female borer, lord of the female grub! ye rough-toothed vermin! Whate'er ye be, dwelling in woods, and piercing, we crush and mangle all those piercing insects.
