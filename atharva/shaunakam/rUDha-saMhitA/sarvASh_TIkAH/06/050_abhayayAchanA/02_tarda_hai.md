### Translation
2. Hey, borer! hey, locust! hey, grinder, *upakvasa!* as a priest  
(*brahman*) an unfinished oblation, not eating this barley, go up away,  
doing no harm.

### Notes
Ppp's version is quite corrupt: *tarda heṁ patan̄ga heṁ jabhyā upakvasaḥ  
anadanta idaṁ dhānya hiṅsanto ’podita*. The comm. reads *apakvasas* in  
**b** (explaining it by *adagdhāḥ santaḥ*), and *brahma* (instead of  
*brahmā*) in **c**, and *anudantas* at beginning of **d**. The first two  
pādas are deficient by a syllable each. ⌊I think Roth intended *hi*  
twice, not *heṁ*.⌋

Ho! boring beetle, ho! thou worm, ho! noxious grub and grasshopper! As a priest leaves the unfinished sacrifice, go hence devouring not, injuring not this corn.
