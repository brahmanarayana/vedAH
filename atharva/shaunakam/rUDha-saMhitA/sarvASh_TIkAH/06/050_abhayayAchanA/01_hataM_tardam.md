### Translation
1. Smite, O Aśvins, the borer, the *samān̄ká*, the rat; split their head;  
crush in their ribs; lest they eat the barley, shut up their mouth; then  
make fearlessness for the grain.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
All the mss. accent *áśvinā*, as if the word began the second pāda  
instead of ending the first, and SPP. follows them; our text emends to  
*aśv-*. In **b**, SPP. reads, with most of the mss., *chintám*, which is  
better, being prescribed by Prāt. ii. 20. The comm. reads at the  
beginning of **c** *yuvāṁ ned adāt*. *Tarda* perhaps denotes a special  
kind of *ākhu* or rat. The comm. regards *saman̄ka* as adj. to *ākhum*  
and = *samañcanam bilaṁ sampraviśya gacchantam*.

Destroy the rat, the mole, the boring beetle, cut off their heads and crush their ribs, O Asvins. Bind fast their mouths; let them not eat our barley: so guard, ye twain, our growing corn from danger.
