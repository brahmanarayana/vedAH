### Translation
1. O gods! whatever cause of the wrath of the gods we, O gods, have  
committed—from that do ye, O Ādityas, release us by right of right  
(*ṛtá*).

### Notes
The whole hymn is found in TB. (in ii. 4. 4⁸⁻⁹), with *mā* for *nas* in  
**c** as the only variant in this verse. Then this verse occurs again  
with a somewhat different version of **c, d** in TB. ii. 6. 6¹, with  
which a version in MS. iii. 11. 10 precisely agrees; and yet again, more  
slightly different, in TB. iii. 7. 12¹, with which nearly agree versions  
in TA. ii. 3. 1 and MS. iv. 14. 17. In TB. ii. 6. 6¹ (and MS.), the  
second half-verse reads thus: *agnír mā tásmād énaso víśvān múñcatv  
áṅhasaḥ;* in TB. iii. 7. 12¹, it is *ā́dityās tásmān mā muñcata rtásya  
rténa mā́m utá* (TA. *itá* for *utá* ⌊cf. v. Schroeder, *Tübinger  
Kaṭha-hss.*, p. 68⌋; MS. omits *mā* in **c**, and has, for **d**,  
*rtásya tv ènam ā́ ’mútaḥ*, with variants for the last two words). VS.  
xx. 14 has our **a, b**, without variant ⌊and adds the **c, d** of TB.  
ii. 6. 6⌋. ⌊In **b**, MS. iv. 14. 17 has *yád vācā́ ’nṛtam ódima*  
(accent! Kaṭha *ūdimá*).⌋

Whatever God-provoking wrong we priests have done, O Deities. Therefrom do ye deliver us, Adityas! by the right of Law.
