### Translation
3. Sacrificing with what is rich in fat, making oblations of sacrificial  
butter (*ā́jya*) with the spoon, without desire, to you, O all gods,  
desirous of accomplishing we have not been able to accomplish.

### Notes
Part of the mss. (including our P.M.I.) accent *víśve* in **c**, and the  
decided majority (not our Bp.M.W.R.s.m.T.) accent *śekimá* at the end  
(by a contrary blunder to that in 2 **d**), which SPP., accordingly,  
wrongly admits into his text. TB. has (also Ppp.) *ā́jyena* in **b**;  
also it reads *vo viśve devāḥ* in **c**;, and, of course, *śekima* at  
the end; Ppp. *śeṣima*.

With ladle full of fatness we, worshippers, pouring holy oil, Striving, have failed, O all ye Gods, against our will, to offer it.
