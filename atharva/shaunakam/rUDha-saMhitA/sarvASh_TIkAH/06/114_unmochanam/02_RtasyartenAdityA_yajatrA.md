### Translation
2. By right of right, O Ādityas, worshipful ones, release ye us here, in  
that, O ye carriers of the sacrifice, we, desirous of accomplishing  
(*śak*) the sacrifice, have not accomplished it.

### Notes
Both editions read at the end, as is necessary, *-ekimá*, although only  
two\* of our mss. (I.D.), and a small minority of SPP's authorities,  
accent the *a* (the *pada* mss. absurdly reading *úpa॰śekima*). Ppp. has  
instead, for **d**, *sikṣantu upārima*. TB. has *mā* for *nas* at end of  
**b**, *yajñāír vas* for *yajñáṁ yát* in **c**, and, for **d**,  
*āśikṣanto ná śekima*, which is better. *Yajñavāhasas* would be better  
as nominative. The comm. explains *śikṣantas* by *niṣpādayitum  
icchantas*. ⌊For the *pada* blunder, cf. vi. 74. 2.⌋ \*⌊Whitney's  
collations seem clearly to give Bp.²p.m.I.H.D. as reading *-śekimá.⌋*

Here set us free, O holy ones, Adityas, by the right of Law. When striving, bringing sacrifice, we failed to offer it aright.
