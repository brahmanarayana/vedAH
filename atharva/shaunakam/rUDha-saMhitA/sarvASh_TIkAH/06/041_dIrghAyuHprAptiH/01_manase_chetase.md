### Translation
1. To mind, to thought, to device (*dhī́*), to design, and to intention,  
to opinion (*matí*), to instruction (*śrutá*), to sight, would we pay  
worship with oblation.

### Notes
The meter in **b** would be rectified by reading *ā́kūtyāi*. ⌊In his note  
to i. 1. 1, W. took *śruta* here as 'sense of hearing.'⌋

For mind, for intellect, for thought, for purpose, for intelligence,. For sense, for hearing, and for sight, let us adore with sacrifice.
