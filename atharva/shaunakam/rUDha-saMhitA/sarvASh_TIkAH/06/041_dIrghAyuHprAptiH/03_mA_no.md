### Translation
3. Let not the seers who are of the gods leave us, who are self  
(*tanū́*) protecting, self-born of our self; O immortal ones, attach  
yourselves to us mortals; grant life-time (*ā́yus*) in order to our  
further living.

### Notes
With the first line is to be compared AB. ii. 27. 7: *ṛṣayo dāivyāsas  
tanūpāvānas tanvas tapojāḥ* (Florenz). *Tanū* (lit. 'body') 'self'  
apparently refers throughout to ourselves. This verse is translated by  
Muir, OST. v. 296. ⌊*Mā́ hāsiṣur ṛ́ṣayo dāíviā naḥ* would make good  
meter.⌋  
  
The fourth *anuvāka* ends here, having 10 hymns and 33 verses; and the  
old Anukr. says of it and its predecessor together *tṛtīyacaturthāu  
trayastriṅśakāu* (*tṛtīya-* given above, not here).

Let not the Rishis, the divine, forsake us, our own, our very selves, our lives' protectors. Do ye, immortal, still attend us mortals, and give us vital power to live the longer.
