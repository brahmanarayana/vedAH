### Translation
2. For him, O Agni-and-Soma, maintain ye dominion, for him wealth; in  
the sphere of royalty make ye him superior to his fellow.

### Notes
Two or three of our mss. have in **b** the bad reading *dhārayatām;*  
and, in **c**, even the majority of them give *-vargre* (as Bp. at iii.  
5. 2, and B. Kp. at xi. 2. 4: but SPP. reports nothing of the sort in  
his authorities). Ppp. has *yasya* for the first *asmāi*, and *asya* for  
the second, and *vardhayatas* for *dhārayatam* in **b**; also *aho* for  
*imam* in **c**.

Confirm the princely power in him, Agni and Soma! grant him wealth. In all the circuit of his rule make him yet higher for your friend.
