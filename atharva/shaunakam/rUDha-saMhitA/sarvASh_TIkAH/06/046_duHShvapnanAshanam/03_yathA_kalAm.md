### Translation
3. As a sixteenth, as an eighth, as a \[whole\] debt they bring  
together, so do we bring together all evil-dreaming for him who hates  
us.

### Notes
'Bring together,' i.e. 'pay off, discharge.' This verse is RV. viii. 47.  
17 **a-d**, where, however, is read *saṁ-náyāmasi* also at end of **b**  
(instead of *-yanti*), and *āptyé* for *dviṣaté* in **d**; it is also  
found again below, with slight differences, as xix. 57. 1. 'Eighth' is  
literally 'hoof' (*śaphá*), from the eight hoofs of cattle etc. The  
sixteenth or eighth is possibly the interest. All the authorities, for  
once, agree in reading *yátha rṇám* (instead of *yátha ṛṇám*), and it is  
accordingly received in both published texts.

As men discharge a debt, as they pay up an eighth and half-an- eighth, So the whole evil dream do we pay and assign unto our foe.
