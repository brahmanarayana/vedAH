### Translation
1. Thou who art not alive, not dead, immortal-embryo of the gods art  
thou, O sleep; *Varuṇāni* is thy mother, Yama thy father; Araru by name  
art thou.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *yamaṣ pitā*. The mss. are much at variance as to two points  
in this verse: whether *asi* or *ási* after *-garbhás*, and whether  
*árarus* or *arárus*. As regards the former, they are nearly equally  
divided; both printed texts give *asi*, which is doubtless preferable.  
In the other case, the great majority of authorities have *árarus*,  
which is accordingly adopted in both texts (our Bp.E.T.K. read  
*arárus*); but TB. (iii. 2. 9⁴) and MS. (iv. i. 10), which have a legend  
about an Asura of this name, accent *aráru*, and this was probably to  
have been preferred.

Thou, neither quick nor dead, O Sleep, art fraught with Amrit of the Gods. Thy name is Araru: thy sire is Yama; Varunani bare thee.
