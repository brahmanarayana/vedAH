### Translation
1. He flies through the atmosphere, looking down upon all existences;  
what the greatness is of the heavenly dog, with that oblation would we  
pay worship to thee.

### Notes
The first half-verse is RV. x. 136. 4 **a, b**, which differs only by  
reading *rūpā́* instead of *bhūtā́* in **b**; it is part of the hymn that  
extols the powers of the *muni*. Ppp. has a very different version of  
**b, c, d**: *svar bhūtā vyacācalat: sa no divyasyāi ’daṁ mahas tasmā  
etena haviṣā juhomi*.
