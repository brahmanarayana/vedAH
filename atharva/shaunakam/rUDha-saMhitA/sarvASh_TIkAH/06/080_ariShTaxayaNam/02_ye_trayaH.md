### Translation
2. The three *kālakāñjás* that are set (*śritá*) in the sky like  
gods—all them I called on for aid, for this man's unharmedness.

### Notes
In explaining this verse, the comm. quotes from TB. (i. 1. 2⁴⁻⁶) the  
legend of the Asuras named *kālakāñjá*, whose efforts to reach heaven  
Indra thwarted by a trick, except in the case of two of them, who became  
the heavenly dogs; a corresponding legend is found in MS. i. 6. 9 (p.  
101, l. 1 ff.). The different numbers in our hymn, as regards both dog  
and *kālakāñjas*, are important, and suggest naturally the dog of our  
sky (Canis major or Sirius: so Zimmer, p. 353) and the three stars of  
Orion's belt, pointing directly toward it. The Anukr. does not notice  
the deficiency of a syllable in **a**.
