### Translation
2. Being just here we give it back; living, we pay it in (*ni-hṛ*) for  
the living; what grain I have devoured having borrowed \[it\], now, O  
Agni, I become guiltless as to that.

### Notes
With the first half-verse nearly agrees TB. (as above; also ĀpśS., as  
above), which reads, however, *tád yātayāmas* for *dadma enat*. The  
comm. has *dadhmas* for *dadmas* in **a**; he explains *ni harāmas* by  
*nitarāṁ niyamena vā ’pākurmaḥ*. Ppp. has *etat* at end of **a**; in  
**c**, *apamṛtyu* again, also (**c, d**) *jaghāsā agnir mā tasmād anṛṇaṁ  
kṛṇotu*. *Apamítyam* in this verse also would be a more manageable form,  
as meaning 'what is to be measured (or exchanged) off,' i.e. in  
repayment. *Jaghā́sa* in our text is a misprint for *-ghás-*.

Still dwelling here we give again this present; we send it forth, the living from the living. Throwing away the grain whence I have eaten, thereby shall I be free from debt, O Agni.
