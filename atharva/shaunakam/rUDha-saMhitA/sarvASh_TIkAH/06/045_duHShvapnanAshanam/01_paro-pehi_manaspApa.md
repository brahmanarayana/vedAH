### Translation
1. Go far away, O mind-evil! why utterest (*śaṅs*) thou things  
unuttered? Go away; I desire thee not; do thou frequent (*sam-cara*)  
trees, woods; in houses, in kine \[is\] my mind.

### Notes
The combination *manaspāpa* is expressly prescribed by Prāt. ii. 79, and  
the anomalous conversion of the final of *vṛkṣā́n* to *anusvāra* by Prāt.  
ii. 28. Ppp. has, for **a**, *ape ’hi manasas pate* (which RV. has at  
the beginning of x. 164. 1), and omits **e**. The comm. regards *manas*  
and *pāpa* as two independent words in **a**, and reads *śaṅsati* in  
**b**, and *vṛkṣavanāni* in **d**.

Sin of the Mind, avaunt! begone! Why sayest thou what none should say? Go hence away, I love thee not. Go to the forests and the trees. My heart is in our homes and cows.
