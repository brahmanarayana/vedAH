### Translation
3. If (*yát*), O Indra, O Brahmaṇaspati, we also proceed falsely, let  
the Ān̄girasa, forethoughtful, protect us from difficulty, from distress.

### Notes
The verse is RV. x. 164. 4, which, however, has the better readings  
*abhidrohám* for *ápi mṛ́ṣā* in **b**, and *dviṣatā́m* for *duritā́t* in  
**d**. Ppp. reads, for **d**, *dviṣatas pātu tebhyaḥ*.  
  
It is probably only on account of the occurrence in it of the word  
*svapantas* (2 **b**) that this hymn is in our text put in connection  
with the one that follows.

Indra and Brahmanaspati! whatever foolish deed we plan, May provident Angirasa preserve us from the sin and woe.
