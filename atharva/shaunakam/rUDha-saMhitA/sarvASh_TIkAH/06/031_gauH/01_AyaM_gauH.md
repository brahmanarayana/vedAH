### Translation
1. Hither hath stridden this spotted steer, hath sat upon his mother in  
the east, and going forward to his father, the heaven (*svàr*).

### Notes
All the texts agree in this verse, except that TS. has *ásanat* and  
*púnaḥ* in **b**, while Ppp. has *prayat* in **c**. It seems to be a  
description of the rising of a heavenly body,—the comm. and the  
translators say, the sun; but the epithet "spotted," and the number  
thirty in the third verse point rather to the moon. The "mother" is of  
course the earth, upon which it seems to rest a moment.
