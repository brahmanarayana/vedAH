### Translation
2. If from a tree it hath fallen upon \[me\], that is fruit; if from the  
atmosphere, that is merely Vāyu; on whatever part of my body, and what  
part of my garment, it hath touched, let the waters thrust perdition  
away.

### Notes
This verse also is found with the preceding in HGS.; which in **a**  
reads *vṛkṣāgrād abhyapatat* and omits *tat;* and in **b** reads *yad  
vā* for *yadi* and *tat* for *sa;* for **c**, it has *yatrā vṛkṣas  
tanuvāi yatra vāsaḥ*, and in **d** *bādhantām* instead of *nudantu*. The  
comm. paraphrases the end of **b** thus: *vāyvātmaka eva nā ’smākam  
doṣāya*. The third pāda is really *jagatī*.

If from a tree that fruit hath fallen downward if, aught from air that is vayu. Where it hath touched my body or my garment, thence may the Waters drive Destruction backward.
