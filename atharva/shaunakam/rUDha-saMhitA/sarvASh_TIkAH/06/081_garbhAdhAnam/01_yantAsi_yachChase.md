### Translation
1. Thou art a holder, thou boldest (*yam*) the two hands, thou drivest  
away the demons. Seizing (*grah*) progeny and riches, this hath become a  
hand-clasp (*parihastá*).

### Notes
In Ppp., the *a* of *abhūt* in **d** is elided. The comm. reads  
*kṛṇvānas* in **c**; he understands Agni to be addressed in **a, b**.
