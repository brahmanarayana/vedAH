### Translation
2. O hand-clasp, hold apart the womb, in order to placing of the  
embryo; O thou sign (? *maryā́dā*), put in a son; him do thou make to  
come, thou comer (? *ā́gamā*).

### Notes
The obscure words *maryādā* and *āgamā* are apparently epithets of the  
*parihasta;* the comm. understands the ⌊first⌋ of the woman: *maryādā* =  
*marya* + *ā-dā* 'taken possession of by men'; ⌊and he takes *āgame* as  
= *āgamane sati* 'when sexual approach takes place,' which would be  
acceptable if it did not wholly disregard the accent⌋. One might  
conjecture *maryadās* 'giver of a male.' Ppp. has at end *-gamaḥ*.

Prepare accordantly, O Ring, the mother for the infant's birth. On the right way bring forth the boy. Make him come hither. I am here.
