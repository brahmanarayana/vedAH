### Translation
2. If waking, if sleeping, I sinful have committed sin, let what is and  
what is to be free me from that, as from a post (*drupadá*).

### Notes
The verse nearly corresponds with one in TB. ii. 4. 4⁹, which reads in  
**a** *y. dívā y. náktam, ákarat* at end of **b**, and *muñcatuḥ*  
(*-tu*?) at end of **d**. With **a, b** is to be compared VS. xx. 16  
**a, b**, which has *svápne* for *svapán*, and, for **b**, *énāṅsi  
cakṛmā́ vayám*. Our *svapán* in **a** is an emendation for *svápan*,  
which all the authorities read, and which SPP. accepts in his text. The  
*pada* mss. mostly accent *enasyáḥ* in **c** (our D. has *-àḥ*, the true  
reading), and SPP. wrongly admits it in his *pada* text. The comm.  
explains *drupada*, doubtless correctly, by *pādabandhanārtho drumaḥ*.
