### Translation
3. Being freed as if from a post, as one that has sweated from filth on  
bathing, like sacrificial butter purified by a purifier—let all cleanse  
(*śumbh*) me of sin.

### Notes
This verse is found in several Yajus texts: in VS. (xx. 20), TB. (ii. 4.  
4⁹), K. (xxxviii. 5), and MS. (iii. 11. 10). TB.MS. add *íd* after *iva*  
in **a**; in **b**, for *snatvā́*, VS. gives *snātás*, and MS. *snātvī́;*  
in **d**, TB.MS. read *muñcantu* for *śumbhantu*, while VS. reads  
(better) *śundhantu* and before it *ā́pas* instead of *víśve;* Ppp. reads  
*viśvān muñcantu;* and it further has *sindhu* for *svinnas* in **b**.  
This time the comm. gives *kāṣṭhamayāt pādabandhanāt* as equivalent of  
*drupadāt*. The Anukr. passes without notice the excess of syllables in  
**a**. ⌊The vs. occurs also TB. ii. 6. 6³, with *íd* again, and with  
**d** as in VS. And the Calc. ed. of TB. prints both times *svinná  
snātvó*.⌋ ⌊As to *śumbh*, see BR. vii. 261 top.⌋

As one unfastened from a stake, or cleansed by bathing after toil, As butter which the sieve hath cleansed, so all shall purge me from the sin.
