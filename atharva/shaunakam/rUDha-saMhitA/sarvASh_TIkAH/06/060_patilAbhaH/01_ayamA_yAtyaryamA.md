### Translation
1. Here cometh Aryaman, with locks ⌊-*stupá*⌋ loosened in front, seeking  
a husband for this spinster, and a wife for a wifeless one.

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **b** *viṣatastugaḥ* (i.e. *viṣitastukaḥ*). Our edition  
has *-srupaḥ*, the manuscript distinction of *sru* and *stu* being  
always doubtful, and the majority of the authorities here giving as  
plainly *sru* as it is possible to give it. The comm. explains *viṣita-*  
as *viśeṣeṇa sito baddhaḥ*, and as used of the "rays" (*stupa-*) of the  
sun (*aryaman*) in the east (*purastāt*). *Aryaman* is perhaps properly  
rendered here by 'suitor, match-maker' ('Brautwerber,' Weber, Grill);  
but doubtless at any rate the address implies an identification of such  
a functionary with the god Aryaman. The *pada*-reading in **b**,  
*vísita॰stupaḥ*, is quoted under Prāt. iv. 77. In **c**, *asyā́ ichán* is  
the chosen example in the Prāt. commentary (under ii. 21 et al.) of the  
*saṁdhi* it illustrates, although the meter shows that the irregular  
combination *asye ’chan* requires to be made, and the Anukr. apparently  
winks at it. Ppp. has the corrupt reading *sa vāi chāyad ag-* ⌊intending  
*sa vāi ’ched?*⌋. ⌊Correct the ed. to *-stupaḥ*.⌋
