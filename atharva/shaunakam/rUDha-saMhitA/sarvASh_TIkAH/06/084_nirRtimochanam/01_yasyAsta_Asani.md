### Translation
1. Thou in whose terrible mouth I make oblation, in order to the release  
of these bound ones; people think of thee as "earth"; I know thee  
completely as "perdition" (*nírṛti*).

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The verse is found also in VS. (xii. 64), TS. (iv. 2. 5³), and MS. (ii.  
2. 1). In **a**, for *āsáni ghoré*, VS. MS. have *ghor̥á āsán*, and TS.  
*krūrá āsán;* before it, TS. inserts *asyā́s*, while MS. begins *yád adyá  
te;* in **b**, all (also our comm.) read *bandhā́nām*, which is better;  
MS. has after it *pramócanāya*, and all omit *kám;* for **c, d**, VS.  
MS. *yā́ṁ tyā jáno bhū́mir íti pramándate nírṛtiṁ tvā ’hám pári veda  
viśvátaḥ*, while TS. agrees nearly with our text, though having simply  
*jánā vidúr* for *abhiprámanvate jánāḥ*, and at the end *viśvátaḥ*. The  
chief result for our text is the demonstration of *manvate* as probably  
a corruption of *mandate*. It was noted at the end of the preceding hymn  
that the comm. mixes up the end and beginning of the two hymns. The  
metrical definition of the Anukr. is very poor.

Thou in whose dread mouth I present oblation, that these bound victims may obtain their freedom, The people deem that thou art Earth: I know thee thoroughly, and I say thou art Destruction.
