### Translation
3. So, O perdition, do thou, free from envy, kindly unfasten from us the  
bond-fetters of iron. Yama verily giveth thee back to me; to that Yama,  
to death, be homage.

### Notes
All of this verse except the first *pāda* is a repetition of 63. 2 **b,  
c, d**, above. The comm. explains *anehā* by *anāhantrī*. The fourth is  
the only *jagatī* pāda.

Do thou, Destruction, thus, without a rival, release us from the iron bonds that hind us. To me doth Yama verily restore thee. To him, to Yama, yea, to Death be worship!
