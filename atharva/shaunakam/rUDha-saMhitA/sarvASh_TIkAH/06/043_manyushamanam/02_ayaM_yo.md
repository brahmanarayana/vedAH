### Translation
2. This that is many-rooted, \[that\] reaches down (*ava-sthā*) to the  
sea, the *darbhá*, arisen out of the earth, is called a fury-appeaser.

### Notes
Ppp. reads, in **b**, *pṛthivyām* 'in the earth,' instead of *samudrám*  
'to the sea'; end of **c**, and **d**, *niṣṭhitas sa ce ‘stu  
vimanyakaḥ*. The Anukr. takes no notice of the deficiency of a syllable  
in **a**.
