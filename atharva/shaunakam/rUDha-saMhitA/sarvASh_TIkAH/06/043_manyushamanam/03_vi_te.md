### Translation
3. We conduct away the offense (? *śaráṇi*) of thy jaws, away that of  
thy mouth, that thou mayest not speak uncontrolled, mayest come unto my  
intent.

### Notes
The last half-verse is a repetition of vi. 42. 3 **c, d** ⌊which see⌋;  
it is wanting in Ppp., perhaps as result of a lacuna. Most of the mss.  
have the false reading *múkhyān* in **b**, but SPP. also emends to  
*-ām*, being supported by the comm. The latter explains *śaráṇim* by  
*hiṅsāhetubhūtām krodhābhivyañjikāṁ dhamanim*.

We draw thine obstinacy forth, set in thy mouth and in thy jaw: So dost thou yield thee to my will. to speak no more rebelli- ously.
