### Translation
1. As flesh, as strong-drink, as dice on the gambling-board; as of a  
lustful man the mind is fastened (*ni-han*) on a woman—-so let thy mind,  
O inviolable one (*aghnyā́*), be fastened on thy calf.

### Notes
The verses are six-pāda *jagatī* (6 × 8 = 48). ⌊The stanza is wrongly  
numbered.⌋

As wine associates with flesh, as dice attend the gaming-board, As an enamoured man's desire is firmly set upon a dame, So let thy heart and soul, O Cow, be firmly set upou thy calf.
