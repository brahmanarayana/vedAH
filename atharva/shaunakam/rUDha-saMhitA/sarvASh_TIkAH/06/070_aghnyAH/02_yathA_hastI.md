### Translation
2. As the elephant strains foot with foot of the she-elephant; as of a  
lustful man etc. etc.

### Notes
The obscure first line is with intention rendered obscurely; the  
Petersburg Lexicon conjectures 'hastens after, step with step,' which  
then Grill follows. The comm. takes *udyujé* as = *unnamayati*, "bends  
up, for love (*premṇā*), her foot with his foot."

As the male elephant pursues with eager step his female's track, As an enamoured man's desire is firmly set upon a dame, So let thy heart and soul, O Cow, be firmly set upon the calf.
