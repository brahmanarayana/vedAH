### Translation
2. To be measured with a rein were they, to be after-measured with a  
fathom: let the black hairs grow out of thy head like reeds.

### Notes
The Ppp. version, though corrupt, suggests no different reading. The  
comm., startled at the exaggeration implied in *abhīśu*, declares it to  
mean "finger." In **d**, *asitā́s* is read by all the mss., and  
consequently by both editions; it apparently calls for emendation to  
*ásitās*, and is so translated *kṛṣṇavarṇāḥ*, comm.). The Anukr. seems  
to admit the contraction *naḍe ’va* in 2 **c**, 3 **c**.

They might be measured with a rein, meted with both extended arms. Let the black locks spring thick and strong and grow like reeds upon thy head.
