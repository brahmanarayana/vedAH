### Translation
1. The *varaṇá*, this divine forest-tree, shall ward off (*vāray-*); the  
*yákṣma* that has entered into this man—that have the gods warded off.

### Notes
The verse is repeated as x. 3. 5. An amulet made of *varaṇá* is used, as  
the comm. points out. ⌊Similar word-play at iv. 7. 1—see note.⌋ The  
deficiency of a syllable in **a** is not noticed by the Anukr.
