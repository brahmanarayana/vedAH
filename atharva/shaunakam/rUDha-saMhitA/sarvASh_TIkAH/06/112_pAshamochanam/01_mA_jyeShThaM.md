### Translation
1. Let not this one, O Agni, slay the oldest of them; protect him from  
uprooting; do thou, foreknowing, unfasten the bonds of the seizure  
(*grā́hi*); let all the gods assent to thee.

### Notes
The allusions in this verse to the same trio of asterisms that were  
mentioned in 110. 2 are very evident. According to the comm., "this one"  
in **a** is the *parivitta* ⌊which he takes quite wrongly as the  
overslaugher—see comm. to vs. 3 **a**⌋. Ppp. reads *prajā nas* at end of  
**c**, and has, for **d**, *pitāputrāu mātaraṁ muñca sarvān* (our 2  
**d**).

Let not this one, O Agni, wound the highest of these: preserve thou him from utter ruin. Knowing the way do thou untie the nooses of the she-fiend: let all the Gods approve thee.
