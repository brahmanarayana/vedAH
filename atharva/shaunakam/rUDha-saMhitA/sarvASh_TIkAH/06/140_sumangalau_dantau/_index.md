### Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xix. Used by Kāuś. (46. 43-46) in an expiatory rite when the two upper teeth of a child appear first; it "is made to bite the things mentioned in the text; and both it and its parents are made to eat of the grain so mentioned after it has been boiled in consecrated water."
