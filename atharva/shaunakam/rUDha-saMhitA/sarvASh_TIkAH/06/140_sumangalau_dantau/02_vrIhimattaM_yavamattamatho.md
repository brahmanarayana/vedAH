### Translation
2. Eat ye (two) rice; eat ye barley; then beans, then sesame; this is  
your deposited (*níhita*) portion for treasuring, ye (two) teeth; do not  
injure father and mother.

### Notes
Instead of *atho māṣam* in **b**, Ppp. has *māṣām attam;* it begins  
**c** with *sa* for *eṣa*, and reads *-dheyam* in **d**. The comm.  
paraphrases *ratnadheyāya* by *ramaṇīyaphalāya*. The verse (8 + 8: 8 +  
7 + 11 = 42) is but ill-defined by the Anukr. ⌊It is really an  
*anuṣṭubh* with **d** catalectic, and with a *triṣṭubh* refrain.⌋
