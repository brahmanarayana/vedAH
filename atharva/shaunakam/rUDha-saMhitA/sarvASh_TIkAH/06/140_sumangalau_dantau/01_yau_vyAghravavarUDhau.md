### Translation
1. The (two) tigers that, having grown down, desire to devour father  
and mother—those (two) teeth, O Brahmaṇaspati, make thou propitious, O  
Jātavedas.

### Notes
Our P.M.W. read *kṛṇuhi* in **d**. Ppp., instead of **d**, gives the  
refrain of 2, 3: *mā hiṅs-* etc.

Two tigers have grown up who long to eat the mother and the sire: Soothe, Brahmanaspati, and thou, O Jatavedas, both these teeth.
