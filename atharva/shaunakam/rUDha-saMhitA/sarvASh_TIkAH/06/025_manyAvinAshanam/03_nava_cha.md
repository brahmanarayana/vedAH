### Translation
3. Both the nine and the ninety that gather against those of the  
shoulders—let them all etc. etc.

### Notes
Ppp., in these verses, exchanges the numbers of 1 and 3, omits *yās*  
every time in **a**, and combines *manyā ’bhi, grāivyā ’bhi, skandā  
’bhi*.

Those nine-and-ninety which, combined, attack the shoulder round about, Let them all vanish hence away like plaguing insects' buzz and hum!
