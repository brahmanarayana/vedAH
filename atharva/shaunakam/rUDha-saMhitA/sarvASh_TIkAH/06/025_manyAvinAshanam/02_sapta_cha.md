### Translation
2. Both the seven and the seventy that gather against those of the  
neck—let them all etc. etc.

### Notes
Part of the mss. (including our D.R.) accent *saptá* at the beginning,  
and SPP. with good reason adopts that in his text.

Those seventy-and-seven which meet round the upper vertebrae, Let them all vanish hence away like plaguing insects' buzz and hum!
