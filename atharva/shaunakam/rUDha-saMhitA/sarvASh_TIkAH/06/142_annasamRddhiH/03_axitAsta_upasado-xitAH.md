### Translation
3. Unexhausted be thine attendants (? *upasád*), unexhausted thy heaps;  
thy bestowers be unexhausted; thy eaters be unexhausted.

### Notes
The comm. explains *upasadas* as here rendered (= *upagantāraḥ  
karmakarāḥ*); the translators conjecture 'piles,' a meaning which cannot  
properly be found in the word.  
  
By a strangely unequal division, the thirteenth and last *anuvāka* is  
made to consist of 18 hymns and 64 verses; the quoted Anukr. says *yaḥ  
paraḥ sa catuḥṣaṣṭiḥ*.  
  
The fifteenth *prapāṭhaka* ends with the book.  
  
Some of the mss. sum up the book correctly as containing 142 hymns and  
454 verses.

Exhaustless let thine out-turns be, exhaustless be thy gathered heaps, Exhaustless be thy givers, and exhaustless those who eat of thee.
