### Comment
Pāipp. xix. has vss. 1, 2, 5, thus reducing the hymn to the norm of this book. Found used in Kāuś. (10. 20), with vi. 53 ⌊so the comm.: but Dārila understands xii. 1. 53 as intended⌋, in the medhājanana ceremony; and also (57. 28) in the upanayana, with worship of Agni.


### Translations
Translated: Muir, i2 255; Griffith, i. 304.
