### Translation
1. Do thou, O wisdom (*medhā́*), come first to us, with kine, with  
horses, thou with the sun's rays; thou art worshipful to us.

### Notes
The comm. explains *medhā* as *śrutadhāraṇasāmarthyarūpiṇī devī*, and  
finds in **c** an elliptical comparison (*luptopamā*): "as the rays of  
the sun quickly pervade the whole world, so come to us with own  
capacities able to pervade all subjects."
