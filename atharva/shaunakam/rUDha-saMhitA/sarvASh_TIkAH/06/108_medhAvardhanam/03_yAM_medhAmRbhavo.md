### Translation
3. The wisdom that the Ribhus know, the wisdom that the Asuras know, the  
excellent wisdom that the seers know—that do we cause to enter into me.

### Notes
It is the intrusion of *bhadrām* in **c** that spoils the *anuṣṭubh*,  
but does not make a regular *bṛhatī*.

That excellent Intelligence which Ribhus know, and Asuras, Intelligence which sages know, we cause to enter into me.
