### Translation
1. Be thou, O steed (*vājín*), of wind-swiftness, being harnessed  
(*yuj*) go in Indra's impulse, with mind-quickness; let the  
all-possessing Maruts harness thee; let Tvashṭar put quickness in thy  
feet.

### Notes
The verse is also VS. ix. 8, where, for **b**, is read *índrasye ’va  
dákṣiṇaḥ śriyāt ’dhi*. Ppp. puts *bhava* after *vājin* in **a**, and  
reads *dāivyasya* for *viśvavedasas* in **c**. The comm. gives an  
alternative explanation of *viśvavedas*, as often of its near equivalent  
*jātavedas: viśvadhanaḥ sarvagocarajñāno vā*. The Anukr., as often,  
takes no note of the *triṣṭubh* pāda **d**.

Be fleet as wind, Strong Steed, when thou art harnessed; go forth as swift as thought at lndra's sending. Let the possessors of all wealth, the Maruts, yoke thee, and Tvashtar in thy feet lay swiftness.
