### Translation
3. If from \[our\] mother or if from our father, forth from brother,  
from son, from thought (*cétas*), this sin hath come to \[us\]—as many  
Fathers as have fastened on (*sac*) us, of them all be the fury  
propitious \[to us\].

### Notes
In most of the *pada*-mss. *ā́gan* at end of **b** is wrongly resolved  
into *ā́: agan*, instead of *ā॰ágan* (our Kp. has *ā॰agan*). *Cétasas*  
the comm. understands to mean 'our own mind'; we should be glad to get  
rid of the word; its reduction to *ca*, or the omission of *bhrā́tur* or  
*putrā́t*, would rectify the redundant meter, which the Anukr. passes  
unnoticed. The comm. paraphrases *pari* in **b** apparently by *anyasmād  
api parijanāt!*

Whether this sin into our heart hath entered regarding mother, father, son or brother, Auspicious be to us the zeal and spirit of all the fathers who are here among us.
