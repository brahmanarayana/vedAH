### Translation
1. What that was Yama's the Kārshīvaṇas made, digging down in the  
beginning, food-acquiring, not with knowledge, that I make an oblation  
unto the king, Vivasvant's son; so let our food be sacrificial  
(*yajñíya*), rich in sweet.

### Notes
Perhaps better emend at beginning to *yády āmám* ⌊Bloomfield makes the  
same suggestion, AJP. xvii.428, SBE. xlii. 457⌋; the comm. explains by  
*yamasambandhi krūram*. The *kārṣīvaṇas* are doubtless the plowmen, they  
of the kindred of *kṛṣīvan* (= *kṛṣīvala*) 'the plower': whatever  
offense, leading to death or to Yama's realm, they committed in wounding  
the earth. The comm. calls the *kṛṣīvaṇas* śūdras, and their workmen the  
*kārṣīvaṇas;* in **b**, he reads *na vidas* for *annavidas*. The  
metrical irregularities are ignored by the Anukr.
