### Translation
1. As the creeper (*líbujā*) has completely embraced the tree, so do  
thou embrace me—that thou mayest be one loving me, that thou mayest be  
one not going away from me.

### Notes
The refrain of the hymn is found twice above, at the end of i. 34. 5;  
ii. 30. 1. SPP. here again, in opposition to his mss., gives the  
*pada*-reading *ápa॰gāḥ* in **e**. The Anukr. takes no notice of the  
metrical deficiency of **a** ⌊but see note to 7. 1⌋.

Like as the creeper throws, her arms on every side around the tree, So hold thou me in thine embrace that thou mayst be in love with me, my darling, never to depart.
