### Translation
1. I have taken thee; thou hast become within; stand thou fixed, not  
unsteady; let all the people (*víśas*) want thee; let not the kingdom  
fall away from thee.

### Notes
The RV. version has, in **a**, *edhi* for *abhūs;* and RV.TB. (also VS.  
xii. 11) have *-cācalis* at end of **b**; and so has TS. (iv. 2. 1⁴),  
though it reads ⌊in **d** *asmín* for *mā́ tvát* and *śraya* for  
*bhraśat*⌋; while MS. (ii. 7. 8) agrees with our text in **a, b, c**,  
but gives for **d** *asmé rāṣṭrā́ṇi dhāraya*. The comm. explains *antar  
abhūs* by *asmākam madhye ‘dhipatir abhavaḥ*, which reminds us of  
*madhyameṣṭhā* and *madhyamaśī* ⌊see note to iv. 9. 4⌋. ⌊Our **c** is  
the **c** of iv. 8. 4 (see the note thereon), of which the TB. version  
has our **d** here as its **d**.⌋
