### Translation
1. Let Vāiśvānara, for our aid, come forth hither from the  
distance—Agni, unto our good praises.

### Notes
AśS. has this verse precisely as in our text, and so has VS. at xviii.  
72 ⌊and śśS. has the *pratīka*, **a**⌋, but VS. xxvi. 8 has again the  
first two pādas, with *agnír ukthéna vā́hasā* (see under the next verse)  
for third; and MS. iii. 16. 4 has the latter version, with the further  
variant of *ūtyā́ prá* (i.e., doubtless, *útya ā́ prá*) at the end of  
**a**. Ppp. has the bad reading *ūtāyā pra;* it further exchanges the  
third pādas of 1 and 2, and reads as 2 **c** *upe ’māṁ suṣṭutiṁ mama*.
