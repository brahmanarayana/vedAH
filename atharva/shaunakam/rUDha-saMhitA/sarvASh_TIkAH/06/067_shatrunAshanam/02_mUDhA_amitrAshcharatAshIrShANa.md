### Translation
2. Go about confounded, ye enemies, like headless snakes; of you there,  
confounded by Agni, let Indra slay each best man (*vára*).

### Notes
This verse is SV. ii. 1221, and one of the supplementary verses to a RV.  
hymn (RV. x. 103. 15). SV. has, for **a, b**, *andhā́ amitrā bhavatā  
’śīrṣāṇó ‘haya iva*, and, in **c**, *agnínunnānām*. The RV. version (see  
Aufrecht's 2d edition, ii. 682) accents *amítrā*, reads *-ṣāṇā́ áh-* in  
**b**, and, in **c**, *agnídagdhānām agnímūḻhānām*. The translation  
implies the emendation *amitrās* instead of *amítrās*, which latter is  
given by all the authorities, and hence accepted in SPP's text. The  
comm. understands *amitrās*, voc.; and he explains **b** to mean as  
snakes with their heads cut off can merely move about, but not do  
anything in particular.

Ye foes, come hitherward dismayed like serpents when their heads are gone. Let Indra slay each bravest one of you whom Agni hath con- fused.
