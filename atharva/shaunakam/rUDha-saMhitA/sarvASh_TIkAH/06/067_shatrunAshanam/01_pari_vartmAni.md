### Translation
1. Everywhere about the routes Indra and Pūshan have gone; let yonder  
armies of our enemies today be confounded further away.

### Notes
That is (**a**), to prevent access to our villages. The comm. takes  
*parastarām* as simply = *atiśayena*.

Indra and Pushan have gone forth along the ways on every side. To-day those hosts of enemies must flee bewildered far away.
