### Translation
2. The ocean is master of the streams; Agni is controler of the earth;  
the moon is master of the asterisms; do thou be sole chief.

### Notes
Ppp. has, in **c**, *sūryas* instead of *candramās;* the latter makes a  
redundant pāda, unnoticed by the Anukr.

The Sea is regent of the floods, Agni is ruler of the land, The Moon is regent of the stars: the one and only Lord be thou.
