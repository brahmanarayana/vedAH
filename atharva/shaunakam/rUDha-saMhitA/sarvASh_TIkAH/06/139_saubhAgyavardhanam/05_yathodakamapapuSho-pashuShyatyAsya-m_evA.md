### Translation
5. As a mongoos, having cut apart, puts together again a snake, so, O  
powerful \[herb\], put together the divided of love.

### Notes
This capacity of the mongoos is unknown to naturalists, nor have any  
references to it been noted elsewhere.

Even as the Mungoose bites and rends and then restores the wounded snake, So do thou, Mighty one, restore the fracture of our severed love.
