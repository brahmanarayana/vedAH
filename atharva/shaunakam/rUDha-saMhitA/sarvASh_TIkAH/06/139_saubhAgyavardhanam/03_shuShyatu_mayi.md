### Translation
3. A conciliator, a love-awakener (?), do thou, O brown, beauteous one,  
push together; push together both yon woman and me; make \[our\] heart  
the same.

### Notes
The mss. hardly distinguish *ṣy* and *ṣp*, but ours, in general, seem,  
as distinctly as the case admits, to read *samuṣyalā́* in **a**; yet SPP.  
has *-uṣpa-* (noting one ms. as reading *-uṣya-*), and, as he has living  
scholars among his authorities, the probability is that he is right.  
Save here and at xiv. 1. 60 (*úṣyalāni* or *úṣpa-*), the word appears to  
be unknown. The comm. gives a worthless mechanical etymology, *samyak  
uptaphalā satī*. ⌊is *samubjalā́* (root *ubj*) intended, as a marginal  
note of Mr. Whitney's suggests?⌋ Our P.M.I. read *amúm* at beginning of  
**c**.

Drive us together, tawny! fair! a go-between who wakens love. Drive us together, him and me, and give us both one heart and mind.
