### Translation
1. *Nyastikā́* hast thou grown up, my good-fortune maker; a hundred  
\[are\] thy forth-stretchers, three and thirty thy down-stretchers. With  
this thousand-leafed \[herb\] I make dry thy heart.

### Notes
The great majority of mss. (including of ours all but Bp.D.R.Kp.) read  
*subhāgaṁk-* in **b**, and this appears to be probably the true  
*saṁhitā*-reading, with *-bhag-* for *pada*-reading, although neither  
the Prāt. nor its commentary notes the case; SPP's edition, like ours,  
reads *-bhag-*. The comm. explains *nyastikā* as *nitarām asyantī*  
'casting downward' (namely, any omen of ill-fortune). OB. takes it as a  
fem. of *nyasta-ka* 'stuck in'; perhaps rather diminutive of *nyasta*,  
as if 'something thrown down, cast away, insignificant.' The comm.  
understands the plant intended to be the *śan̄khapuṣpikā* (*Andropogon  
aciculatus:* "creeping; grows on barren moist pasture-ground. Of very  
coarse nature. I never found it touched by cattle." Roxburgh). The comm.  
ends vs. 1 with the fourth pāda, adding the other two to vs. 2.

Thou hast grown up, a source of joy to bless me with pros- perity. A hundred are thy tendrils, three-and-thirty thy descending shoots. With this that bears a thousand leaves I dry thy heart and wither it.
