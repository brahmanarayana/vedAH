### Translation
2. Let thy heart dry up on me, then let \[thy\] mouth dry up; then dry  
thou up by loving me; then go thou about dry-mouthed.

### Notes
Read perhaps rather *māṁ-kāména*. Two pādas count an extra syllable  
each.

Let thy heart wither for my love and let thy month be dry for me. Parch and dry up with longing, go with lips that love of me hath dried.
