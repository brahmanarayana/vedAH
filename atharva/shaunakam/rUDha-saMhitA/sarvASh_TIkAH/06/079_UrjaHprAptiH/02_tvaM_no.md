### Translation
2. Do thou, O lord of the cloud, maintain for us sustenance (*ū́rj*) in  
our houses; let prosperity, let good (*vásu*) come.

### Notes
TS. prefixes *sá* at the beginning, and has, for **b**, *ū́rjaṁ no dhehi  
bhadráyā*, then running off into an entirely different close. The comm.  
regards Vāyu as addressed.
