### Translation
1. \[As\] glory (*yáśas*) let \[my\] oblation increase, quickened by  
Indra, of thousand-fold might, well-brought, made with power; me,  
proceeding mightily onward unto long sight, \[me\] with my oblation, do  
thou increase unto chiefhood.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Ppp. has, for **b**, *sahasratṛṣṭis sukṛtaṁ sahasvat;* in **c**,  
*jīvase* (which is better) for *cakṣase;* in **d**, it omits *mā*, which  
improves the meter. The comm. has *suvṛtaṁ* in **b**. The "*jagatī*" (11  
+ 12: 12 + 13 = 48) is an irregular one. ⌊Cf. RV. v. 44. 3, where we  
have the intensive of *sṛ* with *anu-pra*.⌋

Let sacrifice, like fame, thrive sped by Indra, inspired, well- ordered, with a thousand powers. To highest rank raise me who bring oblation, me who move forth to far-extended vision.
