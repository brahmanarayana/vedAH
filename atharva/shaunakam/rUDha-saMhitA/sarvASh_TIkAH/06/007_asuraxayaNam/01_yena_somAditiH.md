### Translation
1. By what road, O Soma, Aditi or friends go, not hostile, by that do  
thou come to us with aid.

### Notes
The comm. understands *mitrās* 'friends' to mean "Aditi's twelve sons,  
Mitra etc."; i.e. as the equivalent of *ādityā́s*, which is not  
impossible. ⌊The description as *nicṛt* belongs rather to 8. 1.⌋
