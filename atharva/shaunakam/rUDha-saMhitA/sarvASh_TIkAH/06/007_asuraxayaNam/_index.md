### Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xix. The hymn appears in Kāuś. (46. 4) as a help in removing obstacles to sacrifice, or an expiation for sacrificing for an improper person; and it is reckoned (note to 25. 36) to the svastyayana gaṇa; for its use by 50. 13, see under vi. 1.


### Translations
Translated: Florenz, 256 or 8; Griffith, i. 248.
