### Translation
2. The handless shaft, O gods, which ye cast at the handless ones—I hew  
\[off\] the arms of the foes with this oblation.

### Notes
Apparently the oblation itself is the "shaft," called 'handless'  
(*nāirhastá*) because it makes 'handless' (*nírhasta*): so the comm.  
Ppp. has for second half-verse our 3 **c, d**. Our second half-verse is  
identical with iii. 19, 2 **c, d**, above.
