### Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xix. The hymn is variously employed by Kāuś.: in a rite for victory (14. 25), with iii. 26, 27; and again (15. 6), similarly, in favor of a Vāiśya; in the preparation of the house-fire (72. 13), with an offering; four times in the chapter of portents: once (104. 3) when Brahmans quarrel; again (105. 1) when images play pranks; yet again (113. 3) when a cow suckles an ox (these three in company with i. 19); once more (123. 1), when animals touch sacred things; and it is further reckoned (note to 25. 36) to the svastyayana gaṇa.
