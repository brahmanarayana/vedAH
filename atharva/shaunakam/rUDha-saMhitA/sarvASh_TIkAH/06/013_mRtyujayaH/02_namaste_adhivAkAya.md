### Translation
2. Homage to thy benediction; homage to thy malediction; homage to thy  
favor, O death; this homage to thy disfavor.

### Notes
Ppp. omits the first half-verse, doubtless by accident. The comm. takes  
the datives in **a** and **b** as *nomina agentis*.

Let worship be to thy defence and to thine accusation paid. Death! be this worship paid to thy good-will and thy malevo- lence!
