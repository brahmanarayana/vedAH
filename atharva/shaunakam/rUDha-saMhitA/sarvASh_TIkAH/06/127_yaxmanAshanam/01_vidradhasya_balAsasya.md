### Translation
1. Of the *vidradhá*, of the red *balā́sa*, O forest-tree, of the  
*visálpaka*, O herb, do thou not leave even a bit (? *piśitá*).

### Notes
Or *lóhitasya* may be a separate disease (so rendered by Zimmer: the  
comm. takes it as either "red" or "\[a disease of\] the blood"). The  
form *visálpaka* is given here on the strength of SPP's authorities  
(among which living repeaters of the text are included), and of the  
comm., which derives it from root *sṛp* (*vividhaṁ sarpati*), with  
substitution of *l* for *r*; no manuscript is to be trusted to  
distinguish *lpa* and *lya*, and, as the word is unknown save in this  
hymn and in ix. 8 and xix. 44, there was nothing to show which was the  
true reading. The comm. takes *caturan̄gulapalāśavṛkṣa* to be the tree  
addressed, and *vidradha* as *vidaraṇaśīlo vraṇaviśeṣaḥ;* also *piśita*  
as *nidānabhūtaṁ duṣṭam māṅsam;* and *balāsa* as *kāsaśvāsādi*. ⌊Our  
P.M.E.I.O.R.K. combine *visálpakasyoṣadhe* in *saṁhitā* in **c**; and  
this SPP. adopts in his text, and reports nothing to the contrary from  
his authorities.⌋
