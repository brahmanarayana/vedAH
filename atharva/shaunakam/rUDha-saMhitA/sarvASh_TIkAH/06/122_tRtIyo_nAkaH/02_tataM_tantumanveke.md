### Translation
2. Some pass along the extended line, of whom what is the Fathers'  
\[was\] given in course (? *ā́yanena*); some, without relatives, giving,  
bestowing—if they be able to give, that is very heaven.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The TA. (ii. 6. 2⁶) has this verse also, with variants: *ánu sáṁcaranti*  
for *taranti* (besides the preceding *ánu*) in **a**, *ā́yanavat* at end  
of **b**, *-yácchāt* at end of **c** (Ppp. has *-yachān*),  
*śaknuvāṅsas*\* for *śíkṣān* and *eṣām* for *evá* in **d**. Both comm's  
understand *ṛṇám* 'debt' with *pítryam*, and *abandhú* (which appears to  
be used adverbially) as equivalent to *abandhavas:* though without  
descendants, they too reach heaven as reward of their gifts. Ppp. has  
also *te* for *cet* in **d**. \*⌊The Calc. ed. seems to have  
*śaknúvāṅsáḥ sv-*. Does it intend *caknúvān* (or *śaknávān*—see *Gram.*  
§701) *sá sv-*?⌋

This long-drawn thread some follow who have offered in order- ed course oblation to the Fathers: Some, offering and giving to the friendless, if they can give: herein they find their heaven. 3, Stand on my side and range yourselves in order, ye two! The faithful reach this world of Svarga. When your dressed food hath been bestowed on Agni, to guard it, wife and husband, come together!
