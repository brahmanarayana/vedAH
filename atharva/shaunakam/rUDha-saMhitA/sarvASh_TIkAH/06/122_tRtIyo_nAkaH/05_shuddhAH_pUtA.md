### Translation
5. These cleansed, purified, worshipful maidens I seat in separate  
succession in the hands of the priests (*brahmán*); with what desire I  
now pour you on, let Indra here with the Maruts grant me that.

### Notes
The verse occurs again, with a slight variation at the end, as xi. 1.  
27, and, with much more important differences, as x. 9. 27. In the  
latter verse, instead of the figurative appellation "maidens," we have  
"the divine waters (fem.)" themselves addressed.

These women here, cleansed, purified, and holy, I place at rest singly, in hands of Brahmans. May Indra, Marut-girt, grant me the blessing I long for as I pour you this libation.
