### Translation
4. The great sacrifice, as it goes, with mind, I ascend after, with  
fervor (? *tápas*), of like origin; being called upon, O Agni, may we,  
beyond old age, revel in joint reveling in the third firmament.

### Notes
The connection of *mánasā*, in **a**, is probably with *anvā́rohāmi;*  
that of *tápasā* is possibly with *sáyonis;* but the comm. understands  
"connected with the sacrifice in virtue of penance"; he guesses two  
different interpretations of the half-verse. Some of our mss.  
(P.M.H.p.m.O.) make in **c** the combination *úpahūtā ’gne* which the  
meter demands. Neither this verse nor the next ⌊save its **a**⌋ has  
anything of a *jagatī* character.

Dwelling with zeal I mount in spirit after the lofty sacrifice as it departeth. Agni, may we, beyond decay, invited, in the third heaven, feast and enjoy the banquet.
