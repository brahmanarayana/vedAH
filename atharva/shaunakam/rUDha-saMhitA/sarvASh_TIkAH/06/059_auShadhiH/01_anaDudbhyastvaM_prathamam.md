### Translation
1. To the draft-oxen ⌊do thou⌋ first, to the milch kine ⌊do thou⌋, O  
*arundhatī́*, to the non-milch cow, in order to vigor (*váyas*), to  
four-footed creatures do thou yield protection.

### Notes
For the *arundhatī́* cf. iv. 12 and v. 5; the comm. identifies it with  
the *sahadevī*. Instead of *tvam* in **a**, Ppp. reads *nas*, which is  
better. The sense of **c** is very doubtful; Grill conjectures  
*avayase*, to fill out the meter as well as ease the translation; the  
comm. explains *vayase* as a cow or horse or the like under five years  
old; perhaps the corruption of the reading is a deeper one. *Ádhenu* may  
signify young kine, not yet yielding milk. Both this verse and vs. 3 are  
defective by a syllable.

First, O Arundhati, protect our oxen and milky kine: Protect each one that is infirm, each quadruped that yields no milk.
