### Translation
2. Let the herb, the *arundhatī́*, allied with the gods (?), yield  
protection; may it make the cow-stall rich in milk, and the men  
(*púruṣa*) free from disease (*yákṣma*).

### Notes
The translation implies the emendation of *sahá devī́s* in **b** to  
*sahádevī;* this the comm. gives (it is conjectured also by Grill); it  
may be here simply the name of the plant, but yet probably with pregnant  
implication of its etymological sense. Ppp., in **d**, reads *-mām* and  
*pāuruṣām*.
