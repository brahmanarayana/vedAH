### Translation
1. The bone-dissolving, joint-dissolving, settled (*ā́sthita*) heart  
disease, all the *balā́sa*, cause thou to disappear, that is seated in  
the limbs and in the joints.

### Notes
SPP. adopts in **a** the *saṁhitā*-reading *parusraṅsám* (p.  
*paruḥ॰sraṅsám*), with nearly all his mss., and with the comm. The  
majority also of our mss. ⌊not E.O.⌋ omit the *ḥ* but the Prāt.  
authorizes no such abbreviation, and the point is one in regard to which  
the usage of the mss., however seemingly accordant, is not to be  
trusted. Ppp. reads,  
  
  
  
in **c**, *niṣ kṛdhi* for *nāśaya*. The comm. takes the two words in  
**a** as names of disorders, which is perhaps preferable, and regards  
them as occasioned by phlegm (*śleṣman*); *balāsa* he defines as  
*kāsaśvāsātmaka śleṣmaroga*. ⌊For *ā́sthita*, see note to iv. 17. 8.⌋  
⌊Delete the accent-sign over *-saṁ* in **c**.⌋
