### Translation
2. The *balā́sa* of him that has *balā́sa* I destroy like a *muṣkará;* I  
cut its bond like the root of a gourd.

### Notes
The accent *urvārvā́s* is noted in the commentary to Prāt. iii. 60; Ppp.  
reads *ulvālvo yathā*. The comm. defines *urvārū* as 'the fruit of the  
*karkaṭī*' (*Cucumis utilissimus*) and explains the comparison to be  
with the stem of this fruit, which becomes loosened of itself when ripe:  
cf. xiv. 1. 17. Ppp. and the comm. read *puṣkaram* in **b**. Ppp. also  
has *kṛṇomi* instead of *kṣiṇomi*, a preferable reading (BR. pronounce  
*kṣiṇomi* "false"; but *nu*-forms of this root occur in Brāhmaṇa and  
Sūtra; *akṣṇomi*, however, would be better in place). ⌊See BR. v. 1348  
and 838.⌋

From the consumptive man I pluck Decline as 'twere a severed part. I cut the bond that fetters him, even as a root of cucumber.
