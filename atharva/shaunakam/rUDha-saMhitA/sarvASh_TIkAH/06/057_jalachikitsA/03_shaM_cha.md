### Translation
3. \[Be there\] both weal for us and kindness (*máyas*) for us, and let  
nothing whatever ail (*am*) us; down with \[our\] complaint (*rápas*)!  
be every remedy ours; be all remedy ours.

### Notes
Pāda **b** and the first two words of our **c** occur at RV. x. 59. 8  
**e, d**, 9 **f, e**, 10 **f, e**, where, however, we have *mó ṣú te*  
instead of *mā́ ca nas*, and *dyāúḥ pṛthivi* before *kṣamā́ rápas*, making  
a complete pāda. ⌊Cf. also RV. viii. 20. 26.⌋ The comm. explains *kṣamā*  
by *kṣāntir upaśamo bhavatu*. Our **b** occurs also elsewhere (as AV. x.  
5. 23 **c**, and RV. ix. 114. 4 **d** ⌊this time with *mó ca nas*⌋). The  
first pāda lacks a syllable ⌊unheeded by the Anukr.: read *śáṁ cā́stu  
no?*⌋ . ⌊The Anukr. scans as 7 + 8: 12 + 8: but perhaps the  
"12-syllabled pāda" contains, as the RV. hints, the damaged remnants of  
two (8 + 8).⌋ ⌊Ppp. omits our last pāda, *sárvam* etc.⌋

Let it be health and joy to us. Let nothing vex or injure us. Down with the wound! Let all to us be balm, the whole be medicine.
