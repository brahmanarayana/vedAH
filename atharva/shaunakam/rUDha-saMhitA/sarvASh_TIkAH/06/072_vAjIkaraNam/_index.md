### Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xx. Used by Kāuś. (40. 16, 17) in a rite for sexual vigor, with an amulet. The arka-thread spoken of in 16 may find its explanation in the peculiarity reported by Roxburgh (Flora Indica, ii. 31): "A fine sort of silky flax is in some parts prepared from the bark of the young shoots."
