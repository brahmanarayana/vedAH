### Translation
3. The waters verily are remedial; the waters are disease-expelling; the  
waters are remedial of everything; let them make remedy for thee.

### Notes
The first three-pādas are the same with those of iii. 7. 5, above; and  
the whole verse corresponds with RV. x. 137. 6, which differs only by  
reading *sárvasya* for *víśvasya* in **c**. Ppp. has a wholly original  
second half-verse: *āpaḥ samudrārthāyatīṣ parā vahantu te rapaḥ*.
