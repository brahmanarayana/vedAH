### Translation
3. Save ye us from them of evil poison, from the deadly weapon, O all ye  
gods, ye all-possessing Maruts; Agni-and-Soma, Varuṇa of purified skill;  
may we be in the favor of Vāta-and-Parjanya.

### Notes
The third pāda in our text is made up of nominatives, coordinated  
neither with the vocatives of **b** nor with the genitive of **d**. Ppp.  
has, for **b, c**, *agniṣomā marutaḥ pūtadakṣāḥ: viśve devā maruto  
vāiśvadevās*, which may all be vocatives. The Anukr. takes no notice of  
the metrical irregularities of the verse.

Save us, All-Gods and all-possessing Maruts, from murderous stroke and things that slay with poison. Pure is the might of Varuna, Agni, Soma. May Vata's and Parjanya's favour bless us.
