### Translation
2. With mind, with libations, with flame (? *háras*), with ghee, unto  
the archer śarva and unto king Bhava—to them (pl.), who are deserving of  
homage, I pay homage; let them conduct those of evil poison away from  
us.

### Notes
The *pada*-text, in **d**, reads *aghá-viṣāḥ*, doubtless accus. pl.  
fem., and belonging to has 'arrows' understood; but the comm. supplies  
instead *kṛtyās*. ⌊For **c**, 'to the homage-deserving ones,—homage to  
th'm I pay.'⌋
