### Translation
1. Blast thou unto heaven and earth; in many places let them win for  
thee the scattered living creatures (*jágat*); do thou, O drum, allied  
with Indra \[and\] the gods, drive away our foes further than far.

### Notes
The second pāda is translated according to the reading of our text,  
whose *vanvatām*, however, can hardly be otherwise than a corruption of  
the *manutām* of the other texts; Ppp. has instead *sunutām*, which is  
yet worse; the comm. has *vanutām*. MS. has, in **d**, *ārā́t for*  
dūrā́t*.*

Send forth thy voice aloud through earth and heaven, and let the world in all its breadth regard thee. O Drum, accordant with the Gods and Indra, drive thou afar, yea, very far, our foemen.
