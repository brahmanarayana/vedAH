### Translation
3. Conquer thou those yonder; let these here conquer; let the drum  
speak loud ⌊vāvad-⌋ \[and\] clear; let our horse-winged heroes fly  
together; let our chariot-men, O Indra, conquer.

### Notes
All the other texts have, for **a**, *ā́ ’mū́r aja pratyā́vartaye ’mā́ḥ*,  
and *vāvaditi* at end of **b**; in **c**, for *patantu, cáranti* (but  
MS. *cárantu*); while Ppp. reads *patayanti*. *Amū́ṁ* before *jaya*  
doubtless means *amū́n*, and is so translated above; but the *pada*-text  
understands it as *amū́m*, and the comm. supplies *śatrusenām*. The  
Anukr. contracts the first pāda into 9 syllables.

Conquer those yonder and let these be victors. Let the Drum speak aloud as battle's signal. Let our men, winged with horses, fly together. Let our car- warriors, Indra! be triumphant.
