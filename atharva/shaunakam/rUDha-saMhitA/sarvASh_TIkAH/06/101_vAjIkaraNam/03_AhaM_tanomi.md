### Translation
3. I make thy member taut, like a bowstring on a bow; mount, as it were  
a stag a doe, unrelaxingly always.

### Notes
This verse is a repetition of iv. 4. 7. The Anukr. passes unnoticed the  
abbreviated *iva* both here and in vs. 2.

Velut nervum in arcu ego tuum fascinum extendo. Aggredere (mulierem) semper indefessus velut cervus damam.
