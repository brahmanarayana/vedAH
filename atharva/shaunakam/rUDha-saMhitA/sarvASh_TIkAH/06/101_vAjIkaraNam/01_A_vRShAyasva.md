### Translation
1. Play thou the bull, blow, increase and spread; let thy member  
increase limb by limb; with it smite the woman.

### Notes
The comm. takes *yathā* and *an̄gam* in **c** as two separate words, and  
many of SPP's *saṁhitā* mss. accent *yáthā ’n̄gám* According to the  
comm., the amulet of *arka*-wood is the remedy here used. ⌊Cf. also the  
Bower Manuscript, ed. Hoernle, Part I., p. 5, śloka 60, and p. 17, where  
pomegranate rind and mustard oil take the place of *arka*.⌋
