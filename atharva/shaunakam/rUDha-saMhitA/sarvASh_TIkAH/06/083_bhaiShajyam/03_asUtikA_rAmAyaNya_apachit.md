### Translation
3. Barren shall the *apacít*, daughter of the black one, fly forth; the  
boil (*glāú*) shall fly forth from here; it shall disappear from the  
neck (? *galuntás*).

### Notes
The translation here given of '*galuntás* is the purest conjecture, as  
if the word were a corruption of some form of *gala* (our W.O.D. read  
*galantás*), with ablative-suffix *tas*. It might contain *gaḍu*  
'excrescence on the throat'; indeed, the comm. etymologizes it as gaḍūn  
+ √*tas!* He uderstands *na śiṣyati* as two independent words. Ppp. has  
*sakalaṁ tena śudhyati* (or *śuṣyati*), perhaps 'thereby it dries wholly  
up.' For *rāmāyaṇī*, compare vii. 74. 1.

Hence, childless, shall the Pustule flee, grand-daughter of the dusky one. The Boil shall fly away from us, the morbid growth shall vanish hence. Taste, happy in thy mind, thine own oblation, as I with Svaha with my heart present it.
