### Translation
4. Partake (*vī*) of \[thine\] own oblation, enjoying with the mind;  
hail! as now I make oblation with the mind.

### Notes
This verse, which breaks the uniformity of the book, is evidently an  
intrusion, and has no apparent connection with the rest of the hymn,  
although it is acknowledged by both Anukr. and comm. The latter  
curiously mixes it up with vs. 1 of the next hymn, reckoning it with 84.  
1 **a, b** as one verse, and reckoning 84. 1 **c, d** and 2 as the  
following verse, thus ⌊making 83 a *tṛca* and 84 a *caturṛca*.⌋ ⌊An  
*āṛcy amiṣṭubh* would seem to be 24 syllables.⌋
