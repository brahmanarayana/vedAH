### Translation
4. Go thou apart; make room; mayest thou free the bound one from the  
bond; like a young fallen out of the womb, do thou dwell along all  
roads.

### Notes
A corresponding verse is found in TA. (ii. 6. 1⁴), which has, for **a**,  
*ví jihīrṣva lokā́n kṛdhi*,\* and, at the end, *ánu ṣva* (also *pathás*  
after *sárvān*). Ppp. reads at the end *anu gacha*, and this is what the  
comm. gives as paraphrase of *ánu kṣiya*. The Anukr. seems to authorize  
the contraction *yonye ’va* in **c**. \*⌊In **c**, *yónes* for  
*yónyās*.⌋

Open thyself, make room: from bonds thou shalt release the prisoner. Freed, like an infant newly born, dwell in all pathways where thou wilt.
