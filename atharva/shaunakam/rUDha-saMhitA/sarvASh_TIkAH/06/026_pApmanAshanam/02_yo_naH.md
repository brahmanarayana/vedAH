### Translation
2. Thou who, O evil, dost not leave us, thee here do we leave; along at  
the turning apart of the ways, let evil go after another.

### Notes
The comm. understands *anuvyāvartane* as one word in **c**. Ppp-  
exchanges the place of 2 **c, d** and 3 **a, b**, reading, for the  
former, *patho vya vyāvartane niṣ pāpmā tvaṁ suvāmasi;* ⌊and it has *mā*  
for *naḥ* in **a**⌋.
