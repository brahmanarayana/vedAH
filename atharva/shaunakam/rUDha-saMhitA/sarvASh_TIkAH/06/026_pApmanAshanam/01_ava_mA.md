### Translation
1. Let me go, O evil (*pāpmán*) being in control, mayest thou be  
gracious to us; set me uninjured in the world of the excellent, O evil.

### Notes
All the mss. leave *pāpman* unaccented at beginning of **d**, and SPP.  
follows them. The second pāda occurred above as v. 22. 9 **b**. Ppp.  
rectifies the defective meter of **c**, by reading *ā mā bhadreṣu  
dhāmasv atve dh-*. The comm. gives *sam* instead of *san* in **b**. The  
Anukr. overlooks the deficiency of two syllables.
