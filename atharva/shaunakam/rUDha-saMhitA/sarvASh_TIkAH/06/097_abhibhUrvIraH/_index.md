### Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xix. The three hymns 97-99 are used together in a battle rite, for victory, with vi. 65-67 and others, by Kāuś. (14. 7); and they are reckoned to the aparājita gaṇa (note to 14. 7), and noted by the comm. as therefore intended at 139. 7; they are again specifically prescribed in the indramahotsava (140. 10): a full homa is offered, with the king joining in the act.
