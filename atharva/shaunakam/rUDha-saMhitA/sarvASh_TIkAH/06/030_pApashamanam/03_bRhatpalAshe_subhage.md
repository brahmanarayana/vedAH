### Translation
3. O thou of great leaves, blessed one, rain-increased, righteous! as a  
mother to her sons, be thou gracious to the hair, O *śamī́*.

### Notes
It is possible to read sixteen syllables out of the second half-verse  
(accenting then *mṛḍá*), but the description of the Anukr. implies 8 +  
8: 8 + 6 = 30 syllables ⌊as does also the position of the  
*avasāna*-mark, which is put after *mṛḍa*⌋. Ppp. eases the situation by  
inserting *nas* before *śami* in **d**; it also reads *ūrdhvasvapne*  
(for *varṣavṛddhe*) in **b**.
