### Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xix. Verse 1 is wholly unconnected in meaning with the others, nor do these clearly belong together. Used by Kāuś. (66. 15) in the savayajñas, at a sava called pāunaḥśila (pāunasira, comm.); and vs. 2 (2 and 3, comm.) in a remedial rite (31. 1).


### Translations
Translated: Ludwig, p. 512; Florenz, 288 or 40; Griffith, i. 261.—See also Bergaigne-Henry, Manuel, p. 151.
