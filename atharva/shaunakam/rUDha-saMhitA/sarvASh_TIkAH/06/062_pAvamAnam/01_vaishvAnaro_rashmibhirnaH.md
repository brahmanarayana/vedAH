### Translation
1. Let Vāiśvānara (Agni) by his rays purify us, the wind, lively with  
mists (? *nábhas*), by his breath; let heaven-and-earth, rich in milk,  
righteous, worshipful, purify us by milk.

### Notes
The verse is found also in TB. (i. 4. 8³) and MS. (iii. 11. 10). They  
read *mā* for *nas* in **a** and **d**, *mayobhū́s* (which is decidedly  
better) for *nábhobhis* at end of **b**, and *páyobhis* for *páyasvatī*  
in **c**. Pāda **c** is *jagatī*.

Cleanse us Vaisvanara with rays of splendour! With breath and clouds let quickening Vayu cleanse us. And, rich in milky rain, let Earth and Heaven, worshipful, holy, cleanse us with their water.
