### Translation
3. Take ye hold upon that (f.) of Vāiśvānara in order to splendor,  
becoming cleansed, clear, purifying; here, reveling in joint reveling  
with Iḍā, may we long see the sun going up.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The first half-verse is nearly identical with xii. 2. 28 **a, b**. Durga  
to Nir. vi. 12 (Calcutta ed'n, iii. 187) quotes *vāiśvadevīṁ sūnṛtām ā  
rabhadhvam*, showing that *sūnṛta* is meant here also, as in vs. 2. Ppp.  
reads in **a** *vaiśvānaryaṁ*, combines *varcasā ”rabh-*; ⌊has for **b**  
our 2 **b**, combining *yasyā ”śās;*⌋ and begins **c** with *īḍe ’ha  
sadh-*.

For splendour, seize on her whom all men worship, becoming pure yourselves, and bright, and brilliant. Here, through our prayer rejoicing in the banquet, long may we look upon the Sun ascending.
