### Translation
2. Take ye hold upon the pleasantness of Vāiśvānara, of which the  
regions are the smooth-backed bodies; with that, singing in joint  
revelings, may we be lords of wealth (pl.).

### Notes
The sense, especially of **b**, is obscure, and the version mechanical;  
**b** is perhaps a reminiscence of RV. i. 162. 7 **b**. Found,  
considerably altered in **a, b**, in VS. (xix. 44), and TB.MS. (as  
above). They read for **a, b** *vāiśvadevī́ punatī́ devy ā́ ’gād yásyām*  
(TB. *yásyāi*, MS. *yásyās*) *imā́* (TB.MS. omit) *bahvyàs* (TB.  
*bahvī́s*) *tanvò* (TB. *tanúvo*) *vītápṛṣṭhāḥ;* all have *mádantas* for  
*gṛṇántas* in **c**, and TB.MS. *-mā́dyeṣu*—this last an alteration  
plainly called for by the meter; and the Anukr. does not describe the  
verse as *nicṛt*. Ppp. has at the beginning *vāiśvadevyaṁ*, for **b** a  
wholly different text, *śuddhā bhavanta śucayaṣ pāvakāḥ* (our 3 **b**),  
and in **c**, corruptly, *-nta sasada ādayema*. The variants indicate,  
as often elsewhere, the hopelessness of a rendering.

Lay hold on Sunrita whose forms and regions have fair smooth backs, her who is all men's treasure. Through her may we, in sacrificial banquets singing her glory, be the lords of riches.
