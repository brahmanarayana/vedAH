### Translation
3. He who first attained (*ā-sad*) the slope \[of heaven\], spying out  
the road for many, who is master of these bipeds, who of the  
quadrupeds—to that Yama, to death, be homage.

### Notes
With the former half-verse is to be compared RV. x. 14. 1 **a, b**:  
*pareyivā́ṅsam praváto mahī́r ánu b. p. anupaspaśānám* (which is AV.  
xviii. 1. 49 **a, b**); **d** is the last pāda also of RV. x. 165. 4 (of  
which **a, b** are found here in 29. 1); **c** is nearly equal to RV. x.  
121. 3 **c** (our iv. 2. 1 **c**; xiii. 3. 24 **c**). Ppp. follows RV.  
in **c** in putting *īśe* before *asya* (reading *īśay asya*). Our  
*pada*-text accents *asyá: ī́śe;* in RV. also *asyá* is accented. The  
verse lacks two syllables of being a full *jagatī*. ⌊Pischel discusses  
the verse, *Ved. Stud.* ii. 73: cf. 66.⌋ ⌊Ppp. has *pravatāsasāda*.⌋

Be reverence paid to him who, while exploring the path for many, first approached the river, Lord of this world of quadrupeds and bipeds; to him be rever- ence paid, to Death, to Yama!
