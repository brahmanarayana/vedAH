### Translation
1. With the praise-verse (*ṛ́ś*) drive ye the dove forth (*praṇódam*);  
reveling in food (*íṣ*) we lead a cow about, breaking up tracks hard to  
go in; leaving us (our?) sustenance shall it fly forth, swift-flying.

### Notes
*Praṇódam*, lit. 'with forth-driving,' a quasi gerundial cognate  
accusative. RV. (x. 165. 5) has *nayadhvam* at end of **b**, a better  
reading. In Ppp., **b, c** are omitted. For **c**, RV. has *saṁyopáyanto  
duritā́ni víśvā*. In **d**, both RV. and Ppp. (also the comm.) end with  
*prá patāt pátiṣṭhaḥ*, of which our reading can only be a corruption;  
*páthiṣṭhaḥ* (p. *páthiṣṭhaḥ*) indicates a confusion with *pathi॰ṣṭhá*  
⌊the non-division and accent also point to *pátiṣṭhaḥ* as true reading⌋.  
⌊Ppp. has *hitvām* for *hitvā́ na*.⌋

Drive forth the Dove, chase it with holy verses: rejoicing bring we hither food and cattle, Obliterating traces of misfortune. Most fleet may it fly forth and leave us vigour.
