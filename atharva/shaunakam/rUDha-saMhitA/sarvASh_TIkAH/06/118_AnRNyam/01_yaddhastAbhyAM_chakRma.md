### Translation
1. If (*yát*) with our hands we have done offenses, desiring to take up  
the course (?) of the dice, let the two Apsarases,  
fierce-(*ugrá-*)seeing, fierce-conquering, forgive today that guilt  
(*ṛṇá*) of ours.

### Notes
Our mss., like SPP's, waver in **b** between *gatnúm* and *gattúm* or  
*gantúm*, but it is a mere indistinctness of writing, and *gatnúm*  
(which not even Böhtlingk's last supplement gives) is doubtless the  
genuine reading, as given by SPP.; our *gaṇám* is an unsuccessful  
conjecture. The comm. paraphrases the word with *gantavyaṁ  
śabdasparśādiviṣayam*, and *upalips-* with *anubhavitum icchantaḥ:*  
'desiring to sense the sound, feeling, etc.';  our knowledge of the  
ancient Hindu game of dice is not sufficient to enable us to translate  
the pāda intelligently. The verse is found also in several Yajus texts,  
TB. (iii. 7. 12³), TA. (ii. 4. 1), and MS. (iv. 14. 17); all read  
*cakára* in **a**, and *vagnúm* (MS. *vagmúm*) for *gatnúm* in **b**,  
and TB.TA. end **b** with *upajíghnamānaḥ* (while MS. has the corrupt  
reading *ávajighram ā́paḥ*); in **c, d**, TB.TA. have the version  
*dūrepaśyā́* (TA. *ugrampaśyā́*) *ca rāṣṭrabhṛ́c ca tā́ny apsarásāv ánu  
dattām ṛṇā́ni*, and MS., very corruptly, *ugrám paśyā́c ca rāṣṭrabhṛ́c ca  
tā ny apsarásām ánu dattā́ ’nṛṇāni*. The comm., heedless of the accent,  
takes the first two words in **c** as vocatives. Ppp. reads, in **a,  
b**, *kilviṣam akṣam aktam avilipsamānāḥ*.

If we have sinned with both our hands, desiring to take the host of dice for our possession, May both Apsarases to-day forgive us that debt, the fiercely- conquering, fiercely-looking.
