### Translation
2. O fierce-seeing one! realm-bearing one! \[our\] offenses, what  
happened at the dice—forgive ye that to us; may there not come in Yama's  
world one having a rope on, desiring to win from us debt (*ṛṇá*) from  
debt.

### Notes
Two of the other texts (TA.MS., as above) have this verse also, and with  
unimportant variations in the first half: TA. simply omits *nas* in  
**b**, thus rectifying the meter; MS. does the same, but it is also  
corrupt at the beginning, reading *ugrám paśyéd rāṣṭrabhṛ́t k-*. Ppp.  
reads *u. rāṣṭrabhṛtas kilviṣaṁ y. a. a. dattan vas tat*. But in the  
difficult and doubtful second half, the readings are so diverse as to  
show themselves mere corrupt guesses: thus, TA. *nén na ṛṇān ṛṇáva ít  
samāno y. l. a. ā́ya;* MS. *némna* (p. *nét: naḥ*) *ṛṇā́n ṛṇávān ī́psamāno  
y. l. nidhír ájarāya;* Ppp. (**c**) *nṛṇvāno nṛṇvā yad ayacchamāno*. The  
comm. explains *ṛṇā́n (*naḥ*) as either for ṛṇā́n* or for *ṛṇā́t;* the  
*pada*-text gives the latter, of course. The *pada*-text does not divide  
*érts-*, as it doubtless should, into *ā॰ī́rts-*, in **c**; the comm.  
reads instead *ecchamānas* (= *ṛṇaṁ grahītum abhita icchan*) and  
explains *adhirajjus* by *asmadgrahaṇāya pāśahastaḥ*. The other texts,  
it will have been noticed, mentioned *rāṣṭrabhṛt* instead of *ugrajit*  
as second Apsaras in the first verse. The irregularities of meter are  
passed unnoticed by the Anukr. ⌊Böhtlingk, ZDMG. lii. 250, discusses the  
vs. at length. He suggests for **c**, *ṛṇāvnó no ná ṛṇám értsamāno*, or  
perhaps *níd ṛṇám*.⌋

Stern viewers of their sins who rule the people, forgive us what hash happened as we gambled. Not urging us to pay the debt we owed him, he with a cord hath gone to Yama's kingdom.
