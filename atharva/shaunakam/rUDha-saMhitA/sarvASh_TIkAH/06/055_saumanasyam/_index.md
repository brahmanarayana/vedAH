### Comment
Not found in Pāipp., but in TS. (v. 7. 23-4) etc. as noted below. Used by Kāuś. (52. 1) in a rite for welfare, on going away; and vs. 2 is reckoned (note to 50. 13) to the rāudra gaṇa. With vs. 2, according to Vāit. 2. 16, are offered the prayājas in the parvan sacrifice; and with vs. 3 (8. 5), the initial and final homas in the āgrayaṇa.
