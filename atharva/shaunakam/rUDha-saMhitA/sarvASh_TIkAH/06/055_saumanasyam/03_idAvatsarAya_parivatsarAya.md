### Translation
3. Unto the *idā*-year, the *pari*-year, the *sam*-year, pay ye great  
homage; may we be in the favor of these worshipful ones, likewise in  
their auspicious well-willing.

### Notes
TS. begins with the *idvatsara* or *id*-year (in the form *iduvat-*),  
and has, for **d**, *jyóg ájītā áhatāḥ syāma;* MB. (ii. 1. 12) differs  
from it only in the form *idvat-;* PGS. (iii. 2. 2) also agrees except  
in giving in **a** the whole series of five year-names of the cycle:  
*saṁv-, pariv-, idāv-, id-vatsarāya*, and *vatsarāya*. Our latter  
half-verse occurs repeatedly in RV. (e.g. iii. 1. 21 **c, d**\*), and  
once more in AV. (xviii. 1. 58 **c, d**). Ppp. xvii. 6. 15 enumerates in  
succession *ṛtavas, ārtavās*, and *idā-, anu-, pari-*, and  
*samvatsarās*. The comm. quotes from an unknown source the following  
verse: *cāndrāṇām prabhavādīnām pañcake-pañcake yuge:  
sam-parī-’dā-’nv-id-ityetacchabdapūrvās tu vatsarās*. \*⌊With slight  
changes; and verbatim at x. 14. 6.⌋
