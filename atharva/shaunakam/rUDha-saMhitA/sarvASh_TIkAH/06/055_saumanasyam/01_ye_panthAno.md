### Translation
1. The many paths, traveled by the gods, that go between  
heaven-and-earth—whichever of them shall carry \[one\] to unscathedness,  
to that one, O gods, do ye all here give me over.

### Notes
The first half-verse is also iii. 15. 2 **a, b**. TS. begins *yé  
catvā́raḥ patháyo*, and ends **b** with *viyánti* (metrically better);  
its **c** is *téṣāṁ yó ájyānim ájītim āváhāt;* and in **d** it has *nas*  
for *mā*, and *datta* for *dhatta*. PGS. (iii. 1. 2) agrees with TS.  
except in this last point, and in combining *yo ‘jyānim* in **c**; MB.  
(ii. 1. 10) ⌊also agrees with TS. save that it⌋ has *ajījim* for  
*ajītim*. The comm. has *datta*, like TS., and it is the better reading.  
Both this verse and vs. 3 are incomplete as *jagatī*.

Of all the many God-frequented pathways that traverse realms between the earth and heaven, Consign me, all ye Gods to that which leadeth to perfect and inviolable safety.
