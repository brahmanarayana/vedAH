### Translation
1. Surely no mortal, O Agni, hath attained the cruelty of thy self  
(*tanū́*). The ape gnaws (*bhas*) the shaft (*téjana*), as a cow her own  
after-birth.

### Notes
That is, perhaps (**a**) hath succeeded in inflicting a wound on thee.  
Ppp. differs only in reading *martyam* at end of **a**. For *tanvas* in  
**a**, TA.Āp. have the equivalent *tanúvāi;* for *ānáṅśa* in **b**, TA.  
*cakā́ra*, Āp. *ānāśa;* for *svám* in **c**, TA. *púnar*. The comm. has  
*bibhasti* in **c** (also 2 **d** ⌊which see⌋).

O Agni, in thy body man hath never found a wounded part. The Ape devours the arrow's shaft as a cow eats her after- birth.
