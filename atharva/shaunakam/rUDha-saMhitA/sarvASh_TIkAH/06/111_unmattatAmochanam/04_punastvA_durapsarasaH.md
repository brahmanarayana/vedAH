### Translation
4. May the Apsarases give thee again, may Indra again, may Bhaga again;  
may all the gods give thee again, that thou mayest be uncrazed.

### Notes
The *saṁhitā* reading in **a** and **c** would, of course, equally admit  
of *tvā: aduḥ* 'have given thee,' and this would be an equally  
acceptable meaning; the comm. so understands and interprets. In our  
text, read *púnas* at beginning of **c** (the sign for *u* dropped out).  
  
The difference of meter tends to point out vs. 1 as an alien addition by  
which this hymn has been increased beyond the norm of the book.

May the Apsarases release, Indra and Bhaga let thee go. May all the Gods deliver thee that thou no longer mayst be mad.
