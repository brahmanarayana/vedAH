### Translation
3. Fixed, unmoved, do thou slaughter the foes; make them that play the  
foe fall below \[thee\]; \[be\] all the quarters (*díś*) like-minded,  
concordant (*sadhryàñc*); let the gathering (*sámiti*) here suit (*kḷp*)  
thee \[who art\] fixed.

### Notes
With **d** compare v. 19. 15 **c**. The comm. reads *pātayasva* at end  
of **b**. The last pāda is *jagatī*. The comm. renders *kalpatām* by  
*samarthā bhavatu*.

Firm, never to be shaken, crush thy foemen, under thy feet lay those who strive against thee. One-minded, true to thee be all the regions: faithful to thee, the firm, be this assembly!
