### Translation
1. Fixed \[is\] the sky, fixed the earth, fixed all this world of living  
beings (*jágat*), fixed these mountains; fixed \[is\] this king of the  
people (*viśā́m*).

### Notes
RV. varies from this only in the order of pādas, which is **a, c, b,  
d**. TB. (ii. 4. 2⁸) and ĀpśS. (xiv. 27. 7) follow our order, but have  
*dhruvā́ ha* for *dhruvā́sas* in **c**; MB. (i. 3. 7) has our **a, b, c**.
