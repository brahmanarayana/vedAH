### Translation
3. Handless be the foes; their limbs we make to relax (*mlā*); then will  
we, O Indra, share among us their possessions hundred-fold.

### Notes
All our mss. but one (D.), and nearly all SPP's, read *śatravas*,  
vocative, in **a**; both texts emend to *śát-*.

Handless be these our enemies! We enervate their languid limbs. So let us part among ourselves, in hundreds, Indra! all their wealth.
