### Translation
1. Handless be the assailing foe—they who come with armies to fight us;  
make them, O Indra, collide with the great weapon; let their evildoer (?  
*aghahārá*) run (*drā*), pierced through.

### Notes
The comm. to SV. explains *aghahāra* by *atipratyavara;* ours, by  
*maraṇalakṣaṇasya duḥkhasya prāpayitā*.

Handless be every foeman who assaileth, they who with missiles come to fight against us! Dash them together with great slaughter, Indra! and let their robber chief run pierced with arrows.
