### Translation
3. A bull art thou, with *triṣṭúbh* for meter; I take hold etc. etc.

### Notes
At the beginning of this verse the authorities vary greatly: śB.TS.KśS.  
have *suparṇò ‘si;* śśS. the same, with *patvā* added (as in the other  
verses); PB. *vṛṣako ‘si;* GB. *samrāḍ asi*. The comm. identifies the  
"bull" with Indra.
