### Translation
1. A falcon art thou, with *gāyatrá* for meter; I take hold after thee;  
carry me along to welfare at the close (*udṛ́c*) of this offering: hail!

### Notes
All the other texts read *sám pāraya* for *sáṁ vaha*, and  
śB.TS.PB.GB.KśS. end there; śśS. adds our further refrain, but with  
*udṛcam* (for *-ci*), and omitting *svāhā;* śśS. also adds *patvā* after  
*asi* at the beginning, in all the three verses. The comm. regards the  
sacrifice itself as addressed in each verse. He says of *udṛci:* *uttamā  
’vasānavartiny ṛg udṛk*. The metrical definitions of the Anukr. are so  
far correct that the verses can be read as 28 syllables.

Thou art the Hawk, Gayatri's lord: I hold thee fast. Happily bear me to the goal of this my sacrifice. All hail!
