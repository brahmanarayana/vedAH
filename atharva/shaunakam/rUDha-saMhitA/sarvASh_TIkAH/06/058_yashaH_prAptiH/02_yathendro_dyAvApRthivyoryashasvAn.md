### Translation
2. As Indra is possessed of glory in heaven-and-earth, as the waters are  
possessed of glory in the herbs, so among all the gods may we, among  
all, be glorious.

### Notes
Ppp. omits *yaśasvatīs* in **b**, and has, for **c, d**, *yathā viśveṣu  
deveṣv evā deveṣu yaśasaḥ syāma*. The verse (11 + 12: 8 + 11) is very  
ill defined by the Anukr.
