### Translation
1. Glorious let the bounteous Indra make me; glorious both  
heaven-and-earth here; glorious let god Savitar make me; may I be dear  
here to the giver of the sacrificial gift.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *me indro maghavā* in **a**; for **b**, *yaśasaṁ soma varuṇo  
vāyur agniḥ;* and ends with *-ṇāyā syām aham*. The comm. has *dhātur*  
instead of *dā-* in **d**. As *jagatī*, the verse is both irregular and  
deficient.

May Indra Maghavan give me name and glory. May Heaven and Earth, this couple, make me famous. May Savitar the deity make me honoured. Here may the man who gives the guerdon love me.
