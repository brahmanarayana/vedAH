### Translation
1. To me let the waters send what has sweetness; to me the sun brought  
\[it\] in order to light; to me the gods, and all those born of  
penance—to me let god Savitar assign expansion ⌊*vyácas*⌋.

### Notes
Ppp. has, for **b**, *mahyaṁ sūryo bharaj jyotiṣā gam*, and, in **c**,  
*samotā* for *tapojā*. K. has, in **c**, *mām* for *mahyam*, and *anu*  
for *uta*, and ends with *bhāt* (?). *Abharat* in **b** cannot well be  
correct; we might conjecture instead *bhavatu*. The Anukr. disregards  
the deficiency of a syllable in **d**.

The Waters send me what is sweet and pleasant, Sura bring all I need for light and vision! The deities, and all of pious nature, and Savitar the God afford me freedom!
