### Translation
2. I expanded (?) earth and heaven, I generated the seasons, seven  
together; I speak true what is untrue; I encompass (*pári*) divine  
speech and people (*víśas*).

### Notes
For the doubtful *viveca* in **a**, Ppp. has *dadhāra*, and K.  
*astabhnām*. Some of the mss. read *ajanayan* in **b** (also in 3  
**b**); K. has *ajanam* (if the reading is correct); Ppp. substitutes  
*sindhūn sasṛje* (for *ṛtūṅr aj-*). The second half-verse in K. is quite  
different: *ahaṁ vācam pari sarvām babhūva ya indrāgni asanaṁ sakhāyāu*  
(the last pāda is parallel with our 3 **d**). The sense of **c** is  
obscure, and the rendering given only tentative; it implies *vadāmi*  
instead of *vádāmi:* perhaps, 'I declare what \[is\] true \[and what\]  
untrue.' The comm. reads *viśam* for *viśas* at the end. He understands  
*viveca* in **a** as 'winnow, separate' (*parasparavivikte asaṁkīrṇarūpe  
kṛtavān asmi*).

I set the heaven and the earth asunder, I brought all seven sea- sons into being. My word is truth, what I deny is falsehood, above celestial Vak, above the nations.
