### Translation
1. O all-conqueror (*viśvajít*), commit me to rescuer; O rescuer,  
protect both all our bipeds, and whatever quadrupeds are ours.

### Notes
Ppp. begins *trāyamāṇe sarvavide mām;* it omits *nas* before *rakṣa* in  
the refrain. All the beings addressed are doubtless female; the comm.  
has nothing to say in explanation of them otherwise than that they are  
divinities so named.

Entrust me, Visvajit, to Trayamana. Guard, Trayamana, all our men, guard all our wealth of quadrupeds.
