### Translation
1. Of whom the welkin (*rájas*) here \[is\] the allies, \[who\] thrusts  
(?) people, the wood, the heaven—great \[is\] Indra's gladness.

### Notes
This is a mechanical version, not pretending to sense; the verse appears  
to be too corrupt for anything else. The other texts bring plenty of  
variants, but no real improvements of reading. All agree in **c**; also  
in *yásye ’dám* at the beginning of **a**; between, SV. has *ārájo yújas  
tujé jáne vánaṁ svàḥ;* AA. has *ārájas tújo yújo vánaṁ sáhaḥ;* śśS. has  
*oja ārujas tujo yujo balaṁ sahaḥ*. Ppp. reads *tute janaṁ svaḥ*, and,  
for the rest of l and 2, *indrasya nāgnikeśavaḥ vṛṣāṇaṁ dhṛṣadaś śavaṣ  
purā yathā dhistinaḥ indraś ca rantyaṁ mahat*. The comm. explains *tujé*  
by *tojanāya śatrūṇāṁ hiṅsanāya*, takes *ā́ yújas* as a verb =  
*saṁnaddhaṁ karoti*, *vánam* as *vananīyam*, *svàr* as *suṣṭhu  
prāptavyam*, etc.: all the purest nonsense.

He who controls this air and men who aid his strength, and wood, and heaven, the lofty seat which Indra loves.
