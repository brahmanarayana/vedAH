### Translation
2. \[He is\] not to be dared against; \[his\] might, dared, dares daring  
against \[others\]; as, of old, his fame \[was\] unwavering, Indra's  
might \[is\] not to be dared against.

### Notes
The (provisional) translation given implies emendation of text, in **a,  
d**, to *ādhṛ́ṣe*, in **b**, to *dhṛṣāṇáṁ dhṛṣitám*, and, in **c**, to  
*’vyathí*. AA's version of the whole is *nā́ ”dhṛṣa ā́ dadharṣa dādhṛṣāṇáṁ  
dhṛṣitáṁ śávaḥ: purā́ yád īm átivyáthir índrasya dhṛṣitaṁ śavaḥ*. ⌊Cf.  
iv. 21. 3 and note, and Geldner, *Ved. Stud.* ii. 29.⌋ śśS. has nothing  
corresponding to the second half-line; for the first, it reads  
*anādhṛṣṭaṁ vipanyayā nā ”dhṛṣa ādadharṣayā: dhṛṣāṇam dhṛṣitaṁ śavaḥ*.  
The reading of Ppp. was given under vs. 1. The comm. has *vyathi* in  
**c**.

The bold whose overpowering might the boldest never hath defied,-- As erst still, unassailable is Indra's wrath, and fame, and force.
