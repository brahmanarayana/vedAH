### Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xix., and in AA. (v. 2. i) and śśS. (xviii. 3. 2); and the first verse, in the Nāigeya supplement to SV. i. (i. 3; or SV. i. 588). Kāuś. quotes, in the section relating to house-building, marking cattle, etc., with the simple direction ity āyojanānām apyayaḥ (23. 17); the schol. and the comm. declare it to relate to the rite for success in plowing (kṛṣikarman); the details of the process described by them have nothing to do with the expressions of the Atharvan text. Again, it appears in a kāmya ceremony (59. 18), with vii. 2, 6, etc. (by a sarvaphalakāma, comm.); and the comm. holds it to be intended (106. 1, 8) in the portent-rite for the collision of plows. It is further reckoned (note to 19. 1) to the puṣṭika mantras.
