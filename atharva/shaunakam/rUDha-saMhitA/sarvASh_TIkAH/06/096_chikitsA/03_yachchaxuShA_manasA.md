### Translation
3. If (*yát*) with eye, with mind, and if with speech we have offended  
(*upa-ṛ*) waking, if sleeping, let Soma purify those things for us with  
*svadhā́*.

### Notes
Compare vi. 45. 2, of which the second pāda agrees with ours. Ppp.  
inserts another *yat* before *manasā* in **a**, and has, for **c, d**,  
*somo mā tasmād enasaḥ svadhayā punāti vidvān*.

From every fault in look, in word, in spirit that we, awake or sleeping, have committed, May Soma, with his godlike nature, cleanse us.
