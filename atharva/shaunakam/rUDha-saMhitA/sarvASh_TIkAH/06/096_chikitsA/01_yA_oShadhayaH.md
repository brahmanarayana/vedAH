### Translation
1. The herbs whose king is Soma, numerous, of hundred-fold aspect (?  
*vicakṣaṇa*), impelled by Brihaspati—let them free us from distress.

### Notes
The first half-verse is RV. x. 97. 18 **a, b** (with *óṣadhīs* ⌊which  
makes better meter⌋ for *-dhayas*) and VS. xii. 92 **a, b** (like RV.);  
TS. iv. 2. 6⁴ agrees only in **a** (with *-dhayas*). The second  
half-verse is RV. x. 97. 15 **c, d** and VS. xii. 89 **c, d**, and TS.  
in iv. 2. 6⁴ **c, d**, and MS. in ii. 7. 13 (p. 94. 12) **c, d**—all  
without variation. The comm. explains *śatavicakṣaṇās* by  
*śatavidhadarśanāḥ*, *nānāvidhajñanopetāḥ*. ⌊MB. ii. 8. 3 **a, b**  
follows the RV. version of our **a, b**.⌋
