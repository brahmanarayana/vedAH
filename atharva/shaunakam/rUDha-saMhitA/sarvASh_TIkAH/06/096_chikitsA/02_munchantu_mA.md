### Translation
2. Let them free me from that which comes from a curse, then also from  
that which is of Varuṇa, then from Yama's fetter, from all offense  
against the gods.

### Notes
The verse is repeated below, as vii. 112. 2. It is RV. x. 97. 16, VS.  
xii. 90, which have *sárvasmāt* in **d**; and Ppp. reads the same; and  
LśS. ii. 2. 11, ĀpśS. vii. 21. 6 are to be compared. Whether *paḍbīśāt*  
or *paḍvīśāt* should be read is here, as elsewhere, a matter of  
question; our edited text gives *-b-*, but most of our mss. read *-v-*,  
as also the great majority of SPP's authorities, and he prints (rightly  
enough) *-v-*; VS. has *-v-*, RV. *-b-*; the comm. has *-b-*.
