### Translation
3. May it fly hither in order to non-destruction of heroes; may it  
settle (*ā-sad*) here in order to abundance of heroes; turned away, do  
thou speak away, toward a distant stretch (? *saṁvát*); so that in  
Yama's house they may look upon thee \[as\] sapless, may look upon  
\[thee as\] empty (*ābhū́ka*).

### Notes
The sense would favor the accent *ávāirahatya* in **a**; and  
*avīrahatyāyāi*, which the comm. reads, would be a further improvement.  
The comm. also has *papadyāt* at end of **a**, and, for **c**, *parām  
eva parāvatam*. He explains *ābhū́kam* by *āgatavantam*. At the end of  
**e**, *gṛhé* ought, of course, to be *gṛhè;* but most of the mss. (all  
of ours that are noted) have *gṛhé*, and SPP. also has admitted it into  
his text. ⌊As to Yama's house, cf. Hillebrandt, *Ved. Mythol.*, i. 512.  
For *cā́kaśān*, see *Gram.* §1008 b.⌋

Oft may it fly to us to save our heroes from slaughter, oft perch here to bring fair offspring, Turn thee and send thy voice afar: cry to the region far away; That I may see thee in the home of Yama reft of all thy power, that I may see thee impotent.
