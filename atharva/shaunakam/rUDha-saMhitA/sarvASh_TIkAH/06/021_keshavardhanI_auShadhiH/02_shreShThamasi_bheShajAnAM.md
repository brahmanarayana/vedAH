### Translation
2. O ye wealthy (*revánt*) ones, doing no violence, desirous to bestow  
ye desire to bestow; both are ye hair-fasteners, and also  
hair-increasers.

### Notes
Ppp. exchanges the place of *-dṛṅhaṇīs* and *-vardhanīs*, and reads the  
equivalent *siṣāsantīs* for *siṣāsavas*. *Anādhṛṣyā́s* in a would seem a  
better reading. The Anukr. overlooks the deficiency in **a**; insertion  
of *sthā* after *revatīs* would rectify it.

Thou art the best of medicines, most excellent of Plants art thou, As Soma 'mid the wandering stars, as Varuna among the Gods.
