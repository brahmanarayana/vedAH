### Translation
1. These three earths (*pṛthivī́*) that there are—of them earth (*bhū́mi*)  
is the highest; from off their skin have I seized a remedy.

### Notes
Ppp. elides the initial *a* of *aham* in **c**, and its **d** is *sam u  
jagrabha bheṣajam*. ⌊See Griffith's note.⌋

Of all the three terrestrial realms the ground is verily the best. I from the skin that covers these gather a healing medicine.
