### Translation
2. Propitious to us be the sent dove, harmless, O gods, the hawk  
(*śakuná*) \[sent\] to our house; for let the inspired (*vípra*) Agni  
enjoy our oblation, let the winged missile avoid us.

### Notes
Ppp. agrees with RV. in the better reading *gṛhéṣu* (for *gṛháṁ naḥ*) at  
end of **b**. ⌊One suspects that "hawk" may be too specific.⌋

Auspicious be the Dove that hath been sent us, a harmless bird, O Gods, that seeks our dwelling! May Agni, Sage, be pleased with our oblation, and may the missile borne on wings avoid us.
