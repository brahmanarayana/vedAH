### Translation
3. May the winged missile not harm us; it maketh its track on the  
hearth, in the fire-holder; propitious be it unto our kine and men; let  
not the dove, O gods, injure us here.

### Notes
The form *āṣṭrī́* (p. *āṣṭrī́ íti*) is quoted under Prāt. i. 74 as an  
example of a locative in *ī* (*pragṛhya*); RV. has the less primitive  
form *āṣṭryā́m;* the comm. explains it by *vyāptāyām araṇyānyām*. For  
**c, d**, RV. has a slightly different text: *śáṁ no góbhyaś ca  
púruṣebhyaś ca ’stu mā́ no hiṅsīd ihá devāḥ kapótah*. The AV. version  
spoils the meter of **c**, but the Anukr. does not heed this.

Let not the arrow that hath wings distract us. Beside the fire- place, on the hearth it settles. May it bring welfare to our men and cattle: here let the Dove, ye Gods, forbear to harm us.
