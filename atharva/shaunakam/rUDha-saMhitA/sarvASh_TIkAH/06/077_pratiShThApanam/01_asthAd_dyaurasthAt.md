### Translation
1. The heaven hath stood; the earth hath stood; all this living world  
hath stood; on their base (*āsthána*) the mountains have stood; I have  
made the horses stand in their station.

### Notes
The first half-verse is 44. 1 **a, b**, above; the second is nearly vii.  
96. 1 **c, d**, below. But Ppp. is different in **c, d**, and partly  
illegible; *tiṣṭha...ime sthāmann aśvā ’raṅsata* can be read. The comm.  
inserts 'thee, O woman' in **d**, and regards *aśvān* as an incomplete  
comparison: 'as they bind vicious horses with ropes'! Prāt. iv. 96  
prescribes the unchanged *pada*-reading *atiṣṭhipam*. ⌊Most of SPP's  
authorities have *asthuḥ* in *saṁhitā*.⌋

Firm stands the heaven, firm stands the earth, firm stands this universal world, Firm stand the rooted mountains. I have put the horses in the stall.
