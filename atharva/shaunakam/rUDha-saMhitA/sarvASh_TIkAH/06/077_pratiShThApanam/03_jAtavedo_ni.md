### Translation
3. O Jātavedas, cause to turn in; be thy turners hither a hundred, thy  
turners this way a thousand; with them get for us again.

### Notes
Ppp. has, for **d**, *tābhir enaṁ ni vartaya*, thus defining the object  
of all this recovering action to be some male person or thing. The comm.  
interprets it all through as a woman who has escaped or wants to escape.  
RV. x. 19 is aimed at kine. Pādas **b** and **c** are found in VS. xii.  
8, which also ends with *púnar no naṣṭám ā́ kṛdhi púnar no rayím ā́  
kṛdhi*. *Santi* would be a better reading in **b**.

O Jatavedas turn them back: a hundred homeward ways be thine! Thou hast a thousand avenues: by these restore our kine to us.
