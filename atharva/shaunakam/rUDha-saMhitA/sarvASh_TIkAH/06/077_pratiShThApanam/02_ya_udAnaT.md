### Translation
2. He who hath attained the going away, he who hath attained the coming  
in, the turning hither, the turning in—he who is herdsman, on him I  
call.

### Notes
The first half-verse is nearly RV. x. 19. 5 **a, b**, and the second  
exactly ib. 4 **c, d**. RV. reads *vyáyanam* for *parā́yaṇam* in **a**,  
and *parā́yaṇam* for *nyā́yanam* in **b**. The comm. appears to read  
*nyayanam*.

I call the Herdsman, him who knows the way to drive the cattle forth, Who knows the way to drive them home, to drive them back and drive them in.
