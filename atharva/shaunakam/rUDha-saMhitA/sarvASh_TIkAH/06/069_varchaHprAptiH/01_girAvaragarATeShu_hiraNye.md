### Translation
1. What glory \[is\] in the mountain, in the *aragárāṭas*, in gold, in  
kine, in strong-drink when poured out, \[what\] honey in sweet-drink,  
\[be\] that in me.

### Notes
The verse corresponds nearly to ix. 1. 18, below; but the latter has a  
quite different first half, and with it Ppp. precisely agrees. What our  
*aragarāṭa*'s are is wholly obscure, and the word is most probably a  
corruption. The comm. explains it in two alternative ways: as kings that  
'go' (*aṭa*) in 'spoke(*ara*)-swallowers(*gara*),' i.e. chariots; or, as  
'shouts' (*rāṭa*) of soldiers that 'go' (*ga*) at the 'enemy' (*ara* =  
*ari*)!

Mine be the glory in the hill, in vales, in cattle, and in gold, Mine be the sweetness that is found in nectar and in flowing wine!
