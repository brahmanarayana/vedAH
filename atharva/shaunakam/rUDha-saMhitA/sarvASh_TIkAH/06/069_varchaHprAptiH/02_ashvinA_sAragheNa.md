### Translation
2. O ye Aśvins, lords of beauty! anoint me with the honey of bees, that  
I may speak brilliant words among the people.

### Notes
The verse is found below as ix. 1. 19, with the difference of a single  
word (*várcasvatīm* for *bhárgasv-*). The comm. reads *āvadāmi* in  
**d**. ⌊SPP. gives the fuller spelling *an̄ktam:* cf. *Gram.* § 231 a.⌋

With your delicious honey balm me, Asvins, Lords of splendid light! That clear and resonant may be the voice I utter to mankind.
