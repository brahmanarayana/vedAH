### Translation
3. In me \[be\] splendor, also glory, also the fatness (*páyas*) that  
belongs to the offering; let Prajāpati fix (*dṛṅh*) that in me, as the  
heaven in the sky.

### Notes
The verse corresponds to iii. 1 in the Nāigeya supplement to the  
Sāma-Veda (or SV. i. 603), which, however, rectifies the meter of **c**  
by reading *parameṣṭhī́* for *tán máyi*. "Heaven" and "sky" in **d** are  
the same word; the comm. renders the latter by "atmosphere." The Anukr.  
does not note the deficiency in **c**.

In me be strength, in me be fame, in me the power of sacrifice: Prajapati establish this in me as firm as light in heaven!
