### Translation
1. Thou art born divine on the divine one, \[namely\] the earth, O herb;  
thee here, O down-stretcher, we dig in order to fix the hair.

### Notes
The comm. explains the plant addressed to be the *kācamācī* etc.;  
*nitatnī* apparently not the name, but an epithet, "sending its roots  
far down" (*nyakprasaraṇaśīlā*, comm.).
