### Translation
3. What hair of thine falls down, and what one is hewn off with its  
root, upon it I now pour with the all-healing plant.

### Notes
The comm., as well as all the mss. (and both editions), has the false  
form *vṛścáte* (for *vṛścyáte*).

Thy hair where it is falling off, and with the roots is torn away, I wet and sprinkle with the Plant, the remedy for all disease.
