### Translation
3. Whoever shall curse us not cursing, and whoever shall curse us  
cursing, him, withered (?), I cast forth for death, as a bone (?) for a  
dog.

### Notes
The first half-verse is repeated below, as vii. 59. 1 **a, b**, with a  
different second half; it is also found, with still another ending, in  
TB. (iii. 7. 6²³), TA. (ii. 5. 2¹¹), and Āp. (iv. 15. 1): these three  
put *śápatas* in **b** next before *śápāt*. The meaning of both  
*péṣṭram* (for which cf. iv. 12. 2) and *ávakṣāmam* in **c** is  
extremely doubtful, and the translation of the line must be regarded as  
only tentative. ⌊Bloomfield takes *áva-kṣāmam* as 'down upon the  
ground': on the score of form and accent (Gram. §1313 b, 1310), this is  
admissible; but I can hardly cite an example of *áva* thus used, except  
Pāṇini's *ava-lomam*.⌋ The comm. reads *peṣṭam*, explaining it by  
*piṣṭamayaṁ khādyam;* *avakṣāmam* is glossed with *avadagdham*. Ppp.  
gives the verse the same second half as our vii. 59. 1. The Anukr.  
appears to ratify the contraction *-ṭram ’va* in **c**. ⌊Pada **d** = v.  
8. 5 **d**. Compare also iv. 36. 2 **a, b**.⌋

Who curses us, himself uncursed, or, cursed, who curses us again, Him cast I as a sop to Death, as to a dog one throws a bone.
