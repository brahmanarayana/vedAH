### Translation
2. Avoid us, O curse, as a burning fire a pond; smite our curser here,  
as the bolt from heaven a tree.

### Notes
The distinction of *hṛ* and *hra* in manuscripts is so slight that some  
of our mss. might be viewed as reading *hṛdám* in **b**, and SPP.  
estimates most of his authorities as giving it (and the comm. *idam*),  
though he also accepts *hradám* in his text. Ppp. reads *iva* in **b**,  
and *tvam* for *nas* in **c**, and *divyā* for *divás* in **d**.

Avoid us, Imprecation! as consuming fire avoids the lake. Smite thou the man who curses us, as the sky's lightning strikes the tree.
