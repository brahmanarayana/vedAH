### Translation
3. They whose navel is a licking, in \[whose\] heart is made  
conciliation—let the kine, mothers of ghee, conciliate her yonder to me.

### Notes
The comm. reads *amū́s* in **d**, and so is able to understand *yā́sām* at  
the beginning as relating to "women" understood, and not a *gā́vas;* and  
he explains *āréhaṇam* by *āsvādanīyam* 'something to be enjoyed by  
tasting.' The obscure and difficult first pāda is perhaps corrupt.

May they whose kisses are a bond, a love-charm laid within the heart, Mothers of butter, may the cows incline that maid to love of me.
