### Translation
2. Unto whom enter the drops of soma-plant (*ándhas*) as birds a tree;  
thou exuberant one, drive away the demon-possessed scorners.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *tvā* for *yam* in **a**. The comm. takes *andhasas* as nom.  
pl., explaining it by *annabhūtās*.

Thou into whom the drops find way as sap pours life into a tree, Drive off in thine abundant might our demon foes.
