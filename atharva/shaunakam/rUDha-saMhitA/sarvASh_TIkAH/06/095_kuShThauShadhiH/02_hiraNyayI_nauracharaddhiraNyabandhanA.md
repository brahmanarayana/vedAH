### Translation
2. A golden ship, of golden tackle, moved about in the sky; there the  
gods won the *kúṣṭha*, the flower of immortality.

### Notes
SPP. reads in **c** *púṣpam*, with, as he claims, all his authorities  
save one; as the verse is repeated from a book to which the comm. has  
not been found, we do not know how he read. ⌊See W's note to v. 4. 4.  
But a note in his copy of the printed text here seems to prefer  
*púṣpam*.⌋
