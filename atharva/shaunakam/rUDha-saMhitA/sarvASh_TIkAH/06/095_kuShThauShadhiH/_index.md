### Comment
The hymn is not found in Pāipp. As in the case of the preceding hymn, the first two verses have already occurred in the AV. text: namely, as v. 4. 3, 4. The comm. regards this hymn as included in the kuṣṭhalin̄gās of Kāuś. 28. 13; and vs. 3 (instead of v. 25. 7) as intended in Vāit. 28. 20, in the agnicayana.
