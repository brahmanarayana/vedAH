### Translation
1. Of him as of burning fire goeth the vehemence (?); likewise, as it  
were, shall he crying out go away from me; some other one than us let  
the ill-behaved one seek; homage be to the heat-weaponed fever.

### Notes
The translation given implies the easy emendation of *śuṣmíṇas* to  
*śúṣmas*, which eases the meter,\* and helps the sense out of a notable  
difficulty. The comm. and the translators understand (perhaps  
preferably) *mattás* in **b** as pple of *mad*, instead of  
quasi-ablative of the pronoun *ma*, as here rendered ("he flees, crying  
like a madman," R.). The comm. takes *avratas* as intended for an  
accusative, *-tam*. The verse is really a *jagatī* with one redundant  
syllable in **a**. \*⌊The metrical difficulty is in the prior part of  
**a**; the cadence of **a** is equally good with *śuṣmíṇas* or with  
*śúṣmas*.⌋

He goes away as 'twere from this fierce burning fire, inebriated and lamenting he departs. Let him, the lawless, seek another and not us. Worship be paid to Fever armed with fiery heat.
