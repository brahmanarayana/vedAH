### Translation
3. Thou here who, scorching greatly, dost make all forms yellow—to thee  
here, the ruddy, the brown, the woody *takmán*, do I pay homage.

### Notes
Ppp. reads, in **a**, *rūras* for *yas;* its **c, d** are *aruṇāya  
babhrave tapurmaghavāya namo ‘stu takmane*. The comm. understands  
*ványāya* in **d** as gerundive of root *van* = *saṁsevyāya:* perhaps  
'of the forest,' i.e., having no business in the village. The verse (9 +  
11: 9 + 12) is too irregular for the metrical definition given ⌊cf.  
viii. 2. 21⌋.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
The second *anuvāka* ends here, having 10 hymns and 32 verses, and the  
quotation from the old Anukr. is simply *dvitīyāu*, which ought to  
combine with the *prathama* of the first *anuvāka*—only one does not see  
how, as the two are not equal in number of verses.

Thou who, aglow with heat, makest all bodies green, to thee, red, brown, I bow, the Fever of the wood.
