### Comment
This prose hymn is not found in Pāipp. In Kāuś. (9. 3, 5), it is quoted after each śānti gaṇa, to accompany a pouring out of water three times (iti triḥ pratyāsiñcati; the comm. does not notice this use); and again (12. 3), it is prescribed in all rites for success; being further (note to 8. 23) reclconed to the vāstu gaṇa.


### Translations
