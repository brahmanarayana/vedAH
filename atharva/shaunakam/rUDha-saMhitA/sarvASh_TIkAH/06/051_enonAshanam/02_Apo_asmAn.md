### Translation
2. Let the mother waters further (*sūd*) us; let the ghee-purifying ones  
purify us with ghee; since the heavenly ones carry forth all evil  
(*riprá*), forth from them, indeed, I come clean, purified.

### Notes
The verse is found also as RV. x. 17. 10, with the single variant  
*śundhayantu* at end of **a**; the comm. gives to *sūd-* the same  
meaning (*kṣālayantu pāparahitān śuddhān kurvantu*). VS. (iv. 2) also  
has it, precisely in the RV. version; and MS. (i. 2. 1), with *mā* for  
*asmā́n* and *nas* in **a** and **b**, and with *-váhantu* in **c**. Ppp.  
has *-vahantu* likewise, and at the end it reads *pūtay emi*, which,  
curiously enough, Schröder notes as read by two of his mss. and by the  
Kapiṣṭhala text. Ppp. has further the phonetic ⌊? graphic⌋ variant  
*ghṛtapuvas* in **b**.

May the maternal Waters make us ready: cleanse us with fat- ness they who cleanse with fatness! The Goddesses bear off each blot and tarnish: I come forth from the waters cleansed and stainless.
