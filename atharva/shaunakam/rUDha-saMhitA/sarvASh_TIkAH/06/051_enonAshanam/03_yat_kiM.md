### Translation
3. Whatever, O Varuṇa, that is hateful to the people of the gods human  
beings practise here, if without intention we have obstructed thine  
ordinances (*dhármān*), do not, O god, harm us for that sin.

### Notes
The verse is RV. vii. 89. 5, which, however, reads at end of **b**  
*cárāmasi*, and at beginning of **c** *ácittī yát táva* etc. TS. (iii.  
4. 11⁶) and MS. (iv. 12. 6) agree precisely with RV.  
  
The fifth *anuvāka*, 10 hymns with 30 verses, ends here; the Anukr.  
quotation, *pan̄cama*, has to be combined with that to the next  
*anuvāka*.  
  
Here ends also the thirteenth *prapāṭhaka*.

O Varuna, whatever the offence may be, the sin which men commit against the heavenly folk-- When, through our want of thought we violate thy laws, punish us not, O God, for that iniquity.
