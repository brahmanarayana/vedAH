### Translation
1. Purified with Vāyu's purifier, Soma \[hath\] run over opposite  
(*pratyán̄*), Indra's suitable companion.

### Notes
The translation implies, at the end of **b**, *áti drutás* (or  
*atidrutas*, as the comm. appears to read), which SPP. has rightly in  
his text. In most mss. *dru* and *hru* are hardly distinguishable (and  
not easily distinguishable from *du* and *hu*), and *hru* was  
unfortunately adopted in our text, because the first mss. consulted  
favored that reading. Ppp. has instead *adhiśrutaḥ*. The verse is found  
twice\* in VS. (x. 31 **d**; xix. 3 **a**), twice in TB. (ii. 6. 1²⁻³;  
two immediately successive versions), and thrice in MS. (ii. 3. 8; and  
iii. 11. 7 two immediately successive versions), and, what is unusual,  
with differences of reading in the different versions. VS. differs from  
our text ⌊see note\*⌋ in **b**, having in x. *átisrutas*, and in xix.  
*átidrutas*. TB. has both times *vāyús* at the beginning, but in **b**  
the first time prank and the second *prā́n̄k*, both times *átidrutas*. MS.  
has in ii. *vā́yos* (doubtless a misprint for *vāyós*) and *átisrutas;*  
in iii., the first time *vāyús*, *prā́k*, and *átidrutas*, the second  
time *vāyós*, *pratyák*, and *átisrutas*. The Atharvan reading,  
according to the Prāt, phonetic rule ii. 9, ought to be *pratyán̄k*  
before a following *s*; but (as explained in the note to that rule) the  
mss. read simple *n̄*, and both printed texts adopt it. ⌊Cf. Weber,  
*Rājasūya*, p. 101, n. 7.⌋ \*⌊Should be "thrice": W. overlooked that at  
xix. 3 also there are two immediately successive versions, the first  
with *pratyán̄k...átidrutaḥ*, the second with *prā́n̄k...átidrutaḥ*.  
Moreover, VS. has in x. (like TB.) *vāyúḥ*.⌋
