### Translation
1. I have gone about the race of snakes, as the sun about the sky, as  
night about living creatures other than the swan (*haṅsá*); thereby do I  
ward off thy poison.

### Notes
It would appear from this that the *haṅsa* is regarded as exempt from  
the dominion of night, doubtless as remaining awake; cf. Pliny, *Nat.  
Hist.* x. 23. But Ppp. reads, in **c, d**, *rātrāu jagad ivāṁ ni  
dhvaṅsād avādīr imaṁ viṣam*. The comm. reads and explains *janim āgamam*  
in **b**; and in **c** derives *haṅsa* from root *han*, and makes it  
mean the soul (*ātman*), to which alone poison does not penetrate! The  
Anukr. does not heed the redundant syllable in **c**. ⌊Ppp. combines  
*ahīnām*, without elision.⌋

I, As the Sun goes round the heaven, have travelled round the Serpents' race. I ward thy poison off, as Night parts all else living from the Sun.
