Found also in Pāipp. xix. Used by Kāuś. (23. 9) in a rite for prosperity in connection with the division of inherited property; and twice (124. 6; 135. 10) in the chapter of portents, when two crowns appear on some one's head and when the house-beam breaks; and it is reckoned to the puṣṭika mantras (note to 19. 1) and to the svastyayana gaṇa ⌊note to 25. 36⌋. For its employment with vi. 1, 3 etc., see under vi. 1; and in Vāit. with vi. 3 etc., see under vi. 3.
