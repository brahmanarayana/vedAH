### Translation
 3. Unto knowledge (? *dhī́*), O Aśvins, do ye aid us; make wide for us,  
O wide-goer, unremitting; O heaven, father, repel whatever misfortune.

### Notes
The beginning of the verse is probably corrupt, but Ppp. gives no  
various reading, merely prefixing *deva tvaṣṭar* (apparently out of  
3.3): compare RV. i. 117. 23 **b**, *víśvā dhíyo aśvinā prā́vatam me*. In  
**c**, the great majority of mss., which SPP. follows, have the true  
accent *dyāùṣ* (i.e. *dí-āus*, the word requiring to be pronounced as  
two syllables: see my *Skt. Gram.* 314 b); exceptions among our mss. are  
only Bp. and I. Several of our *saṁhitā*-mss. have *ḥ* before *pítar*  
(viz. P.M.E.H.). The meter lacks a syllable in **a**. ⌊Correct the ed.  
to *dyāùṣ*.⌋

May both the Asvins further our devotion. With ceaseless care deliver us, Wide-Ranger! O Father Heaven, keep from us all misfortunes.
