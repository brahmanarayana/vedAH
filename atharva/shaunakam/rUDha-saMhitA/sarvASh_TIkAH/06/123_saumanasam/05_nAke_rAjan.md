### Translation
5. In the firmament, O king, stand firm; there let this stand firm; know  
of what we have bestowed, O king; do thou, O god, be well-willing.

### Notes
The comm. understands the addresses of this verse as made to Soma, which  
is very questionable; and the "this" of **b** to be the *iṣṭāpūrtám*,  
which (or *dattám*, vs. 4) is right. It must be by a corruption of the  
text that the Anukr. does not define the verse as an *anuṣṭubh*.

O King, take thou thy stand in heaven, there also let that gift be placed. Recognize, King, the gift which we have given, and be gracious, God!
