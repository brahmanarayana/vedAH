### Translation
2. Recognize ye him in the highest firmament; ye divine associates, ye  
know \[his\] world there; the sacrificer follows after well-being; make  
ye what he has offered and bestowed plain for him.

### Notes
This verse is found with the preceding in VS. (xviii. 60) and K. (xl.  
13), and also in TB. (iii. 7. 13³⁻⁴), but with considerable variants: at  
the beginning, *etám jānātha* (TB. *jānītāt*) *par-*; in **b**, TB.  
*vṛ́kās* for *dévās*, both VS. and TB. *sadh-* unaccented, which is  
better, but VS. *vida*, which is bad, and both *rūpám asya* (for *lokám  
átra*), which gives a better sense; for **c**, both *yád āgáchāt  
pathíbhir devayā́nāis;* in **d**, both *iṣṭāpūrté*, and VS. *kṛṇavātha*,  
but TB. *kṛṇutāt*, both without *sma*.

Do ye acknowledge him in highest heaven: ye know the world here present in assembly. In peace will he who sacrifices follow: show him the joy which comes from pious actions.
