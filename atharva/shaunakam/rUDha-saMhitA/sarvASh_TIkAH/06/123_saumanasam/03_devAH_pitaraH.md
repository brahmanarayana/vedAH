### Translation
3. O gods! O Fathers! O Fathers! O gods! who I am, he am I.

### Notes
The comm., with his usual carelessness of accent, takes the vocatives  
here for nominatives. Some of SPP's authorities (also our O.s.m.) omit  
the accent of the first *asmi*.

Gods are the Fathers, and the Fathers Gods. I am the very man I am.
