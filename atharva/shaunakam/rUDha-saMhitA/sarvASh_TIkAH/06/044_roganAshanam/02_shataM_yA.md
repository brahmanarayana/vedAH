### Translation
2. What hundred remedies are thine, and \[what\] thousand,  
assembled—\[with them thou art\] the most excellent remedy for flux, the  
best effacer of disease.

### Notes
Ppp. has *yat* for *yā* in **a**, and *sambhṛtāni* (for *-gatāni*) in  
**b**; instead of **c**, it reads *teṣām asi tvam uttamam anāsrāva  
sarogaṇaṁ*\* (= ii. 3. 2 **c, d**); in **d**, *-ṣṭha*. The Ppp. reading,  
and ii. 3. 2, suggest supplying rather 'of them' than 'with them'  
between the half-verses. The comm. understands **a, b** as addressed to  
the patient (*vyādhita*). \*⌊Intending, presumably, *anāsrāvam  
arogaṇaṁ.*⌋
