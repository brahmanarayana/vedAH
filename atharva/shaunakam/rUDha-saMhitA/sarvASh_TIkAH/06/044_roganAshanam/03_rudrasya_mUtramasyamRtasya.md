### Translation
3. Rudra's urine art thou, the navel of the immortal (*amṛ́ta*);  
*viṣāṇakā́* ('horny') by name art thou, arisen from the root of the  
Fathers, an effacer of the *vātī́kṛta*.

### Notes
This prose-stanza is reckoned by the Anukr. as if metrical. *Vātī́kṛta*,  
like *vātīkārā*, is too doubtful to render; its derivation from *vāta*  
'wind' is extremely unsatisfactory, and Zimmer's connection of *vāta*  
with our "wound" etc. is also questionable; the comm. understands *vātī  
kṛtanāśanī* (*vātī* = *āsrāvasya rogasya śoṣayitrī*). The name  
*viṣāṇakā* points to some use of a horn, such as is indicated in the  
Kāuśika (*svayaṁsrasta gośṛn̄ga* 'a self-shed cow-horn '). ⌊Note that the  
epithet "deciduous" (*svayaṁsrasta*) corroborates the etymology of  
*viṣā́ṇā* as set forth by W. at iii. 7. 1, note.⌋ The verse (7 + 6: 8 + 8  
+ 7) does not at all agree with the description of the Anukr.

Thou art the stream that Rudra pours, the closest kin of Amrita. Thy name is called Vishanaka: thou sprangest from the Fathers' root, removing illness caused by wind.
