### Translation
3. Whoever, O Soma, shall assail us, of the same kindred and also a  
stranger—draw (*tṛ*) away his strength, like the great sky, even now  
(?).

### Notes
Ppp. reads, in **a**, *ye na somā ’bhidāsataḥ*. The verse is RV. x. 133.  
5, which reads *indra* for *soma* in **a**, *áva* for *ápa* in **c**,  
and *ádha tmánā* at the end. For this last, the *vadhatmánā* (not  
divided in the *pada*-text) of all the AV. mss. seems merely an  
unintelligent corruption (altered in our text to *vadha tmánā*). The  
comm., however, naturally makes no difficulty of understanding it as =  
*vadhātmanā* (explaining it by *aśanirūpeṇa*) and as qualifying  
*āyudhena* understood. The emendation *mahī́m ’va* would give a better  
sense: 'as the sky \[subjects\] the earth.' ⌊To my thinking, it is  
licit, without emendation, to interpret *mahī́va* as a correct graphic  
representation of *mahī́m iva* with "elision and crasis" (see references  
under this head in my *Noun-Inflection*, JAOS. x. 599, and p. 331 top),  
as in RV. iv. i. 3, *ráthyeva* = *ráthiam iva.*⌋

Soma, whoever troubleth us, be he a stranger or akin, Deprive him of the strength he hath: slay him thy-self like mighty Dyaus!
