### Translation
3. Twelvefold is deposited what was wiped off by Trita—sins of human  
beings; if from that the seizure hath reached thee, let the gods make it  
disappear for thee by the incantation.

### Notes
'Twelvefold': i.e., apparently, in twelve different places, or classes,  
or individuals. TB. (l.c.) specifies eight offenders to whom the  
transference was successively made; and the "twelve" is made up,  
according to the commentator, of the gods, Trita and his two brothers,  
and these eight. ⌊The vs. is no *pan̄kti*.⌋  
  
This hymn is the last of the 11, with 37 verses, that constitute the  
eleventh *anuvāka;* the Anukr. says: *prāk tasmāt saptatriṅśaḥ*.

Stored in twelve separate places lies what Trita hath wiped away, the sins of human beings. Thence if the female fiend hath made thee captive, the Gods by prayer shall banish her and free thee.
