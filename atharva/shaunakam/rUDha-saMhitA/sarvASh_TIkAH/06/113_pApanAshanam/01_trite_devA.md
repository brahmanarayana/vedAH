### Translation
1. On Trita the gods wiped off that sin; Trita wiped it off on human  
beings; if from that the seizure hath reached thee, let the gods make it  
disappear for thee by the incantation *bráhman*).

### Notes
SPP. properly emends the name, here and in vs. 3, to *tritá*, though all  
his authorities, like ours, read *tṛtá;* he also, with equal reason,  
emends *enam* to *enat* (*enan*) in **b**. TB. has (in iii. 7. 12⁵) what  
corresponds to the first three pādas, reading both *tritá* and *enan\*;*  
for **c** it has *táto mā yádi kíṁ cid ānaśé*. The comm. reads *trita*  
and *etat*. He also quotes from TB. iii. 2. 8⁹⁻¹², some passages from  
the story, as there told, of Ekata, Dvita, and Trita, and of the  
transference of guilt by the gods to them and by them to other beings. A  
similar story is found in MS. iv. 1. 9 (where read *krūráṁ mārkṣ-*,  
twice). The TB. verse relating to this is in our text adapted to another  
purpose. The comm. holds the "sin" to be still that of overslaughing, as  
in the preceding hymn. The Anukr. disregards the irregularities of  
meter. \*⌊And *māmṛje*.⌋

This sin the Gods wiped off and laid on Trita, and Trita wiped it off on human beings. Thence if the female fiend hath made thee captive, the Gods by prayer shall banish her and free thee.
