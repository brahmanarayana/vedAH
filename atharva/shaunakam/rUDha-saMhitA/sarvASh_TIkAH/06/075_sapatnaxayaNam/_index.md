### Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xix. (with the verse-order 1, 3, 2); and in TB. (iii. 3. 113-4) and Āp. (iii. 14. 2). ⌊TB. and Āp. agree with Pāipp. in the verse-order and several other points.⌋ Used by Kāuś. (47. 10) in a rite of sorcery; and again similarly (48. 29-31), with strewing of darbha grass.
