### Translation
3. Let him go \[beyond\] three distances; let him go beyond the five  
peoples; let him go beyond the three shining spaces, whence he shall not  
come back, through constant years, so long as the sun shall be in the  
sky.

### Notes
Instead of *étu*, TB.Āp. have three times *ihí*, and they omit pādas  
**d, e**; RV. (viii. 32. 22 **a, b**) agrees with them in pādas **a,  
b**. Ppp. reads *anu* for *ati* at end of **b**, and has, for **c**, the  
corrupt *iha ca tvā tu rocanā;* it omits **d, e**, like the other texts.  
The *pada*-text reads *rocanā́* (not -*nāḥ*), maintaining the usual and  
proper gender of the word, although, being qualified by *tisrā́s*, it is  
apparently taken here as feminine, and should be *rocanāḥ*. The mark of  
punctuation added after **d** in our edition is not in the mss.; it was  
heedlessly introduced in going through the press; and the accent of  
*śaśvatī́bhyas* is misprinted.

To the three distances, beyond mankind's Five Races, let him go, Beyond the three skies let him go, whence he shall never come- again In all the years that are to be, long as the Sun is in the heaven.
