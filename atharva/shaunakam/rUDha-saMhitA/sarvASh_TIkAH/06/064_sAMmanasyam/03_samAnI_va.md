### Translation
3. Be your design the same, your hearts the same, your mind the same,  
that it may be well for you together.

### Notes
MS. has, for **a**, *samānā́ vā* (i.e. *vas*) *ā́kūtāni*. The comm.  
appears to understand *su saha* as two independent words in **d**. ⌊See  
MGS. i. 8. 10 and p. 156, s.v. *samānā*.⌋ ⌊Pāda **a** lacks a syllable,  
easily supplied.⌋
