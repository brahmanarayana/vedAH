### Translation
2. With the red knife (*svádhiti*), make thou a pair (*mithuná*) on  
\[their\] two ears; the Aśvins have made the mark; be that numerous by  
progeny.

### Notes
The comm. explains *mithunam* as *strīpuṅsātmakaṁ cihnam*, and regards  
it as applied to the calf's ears. ⌊If the comm. is correct on this  
point, as is altogether likely, this marking the cattle's ears with  
marks resembling the genitals is a bit of symbolism most interesting to  
the student of folk-lore.⌋ The 'red' knife is doubtless of copper ⌊so  
also the comm.⌋. Ppp. reads *lakṣmi* in **c** (but *lakṣma* in vs. 3).  
MB. (i. 8. 7) has the first half-verse, with *kṛtam* for *kṛdhi*.

Take thou the iron axe and make a pair by marks upon their ears. This sign the Asvins have impressed: let these increase and multiply.
