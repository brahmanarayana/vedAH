### Translation
3. With both, O divine impeller (*savitár*), with purifier and with  
impulse, do thou purify us in order to seeing.

### Notes
This verse is found in all the texts that have vs. i. RV. (ix. 67. 25)  
VS. (xix. 43) have, for **c**, *mā́m punīhi viśvátaḥ*, and MS. (as above)  
the same save *punāhi;* TB. (i. 4. 8²) gives instead *idám bráhma  
punīmahe*.
