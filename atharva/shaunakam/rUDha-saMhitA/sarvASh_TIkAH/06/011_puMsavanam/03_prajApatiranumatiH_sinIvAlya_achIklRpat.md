### Translation
3. Prajāpati, Anumati, Sinīvālī hath shaped; may he put elsewhere  
woman-birth; but may he put here a male.

### Notes
Ppp. has in **c** *triṣūyam* 'triple birth' (or for *strīṣūyam?*). Two  
of the Prāt. rules (ii. 88, iv. 83) mention *strāísūyam* (p.  
*strāísūyam*). śGS. has for this verse also a correspondent (i. 19):  
*prajāpatir vy adadhāt savitā vy akalpayat: strīṣūyam anyānt sv*  
(*anyāsv?*) *ā dadhat pumāṅsam ā dadhād iha*.
