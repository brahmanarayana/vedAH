### Translation
1. The *aśvatthá* \[has\] mounted upon the *śamī́;* there is made the  
generation of a male; that verily is the obtainment of a son; that we  
bring into women.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Some of SPP's mss. read, with the comm., *puṁsávanam* in **b**. Ppp.  
combines *aśvatthā ”rū-* in **a**, and for **c, d** has *tad eva tasya  
bheṣajaṁ yat strīṣv āharanti tam*, 'that is the remedy of this—-namely,  
that they put this into women.'
