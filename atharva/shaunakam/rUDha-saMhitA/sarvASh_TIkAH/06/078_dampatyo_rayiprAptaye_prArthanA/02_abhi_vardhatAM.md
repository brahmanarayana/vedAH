### Translation
2. Let him grow superior to \[her\] by fatness (*páyas*), let him grow  
superior to \[her\] by royalty; by wealth of thousand-fold splendor let  
these two be unexhausted.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Ppp. has, in **a**, *prajayā* instead of *payasā*. The accent *stā́m* is  
read by all but one (O.) of our mss. and by all but one ⌊or two⌋ of  
SPP's.
