### Translation
2. Rudra hath crushed (*śṛ*) your necks, O *piśācás;* let him crush in  
(*api-śṛ*) your ribs, O sorcerers; the plant of universal power hath  
made you go to Yama.

### Notes
A few of SPP's authorities (also the Anukr., in citing the verse) read  
*aśarīt* in **a**. Some of our mss. accent *piśācā́ḥ* at end of **a**  
(P.M.I.p.m.), and *yātudhānā́ḥ* (P.M.I.); all the *pada*-mss. absurdly  
have *viśvátaḥ॰vīryāḥ* at end of **c**. Ppp. has, for **a, b**, *śarvo  
vo grīvāy aśarīṣ piśācā vo ’pa śṛṇāty agniḥ* and in **d** it gives  
*mṛtyunā* for *yamena*. ⌊The "verbal forms with suspicious *āi*" in the  
AV. (*śarāis* etc., *asaparyāit:* cf . *Gram.* §§555 c, 904 b, 1068 a)  
have been treated by Bloomfield, ZDMG. xlviii. 574 ff., and Böhtlingk,  
ibidem, liv. 510 ff. Cf. also note to xviii. 3. 40.⌋

Let Rudra break your necks, O ye Pisachas, and split your ribs asunder, Yatudhanas! Your herb of universal power with Yama hath allied itself.
