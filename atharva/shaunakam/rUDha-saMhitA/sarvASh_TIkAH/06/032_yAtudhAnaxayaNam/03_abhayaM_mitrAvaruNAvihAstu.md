### Translation
3. Fearlessness, O Mitra-and-Varuṇa, be ours here; drive ye backward the  
devourers with your gleam; let them not find a knower, nor a foundation  
(*pratiṣṭhā́*); mutually destroying one another let them go unto death.

### Notes
The verse occurs also in AGS. (iii. 10. 11), which has, in **a, b**,  
*-ṇā mahyam astv arciṣā śatrūn dahatam pratītya;* in **c**, *vindantu;*  
in **d**, *bhindānās*. The latter half-verse is found again as viii. 8.  
21 **c, d**. Pāda **a** has a redundant syllable unheeded by the Anukr.

Here, Mitra-Varuna! may we dwell safely: with splendour drive the greedy demons backward, Let them not find a surety or a refuge, but torn away go down to Death together.
