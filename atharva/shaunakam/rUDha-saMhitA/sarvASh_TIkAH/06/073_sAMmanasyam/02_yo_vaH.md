### Translation
2. The vehemence (*śúṣma*) that is within your hearts, the design that  
has entered into your mind—that I frustrate with the oblation, the ghee;  
in me, O \[my\] fellows, be your satisfaction (*ramáti*).

### Notes
Intended to restrain intending emigrants, apparently; as also vs. 3. All  
the mss., and both editions with them, read *tā́n* at the beginning of  
**c**, although it is unquestionably an error for *tā́m*, referring to  
*ā́kūtim*, as the comm. correctly reads and understands. Only one ms.  
(our Bp.²) has *srīvayāmi*, all the rest *śrīv-*, or its phonetic  
product, *chrīv-*; but SPP. quite unaccountably (against the sense, and  
against the use of √*sīv*, which has no causative conjugation quotable  
before the Lalita-Vistara) adopts *sīvayāmi* from the comm. (=  
*parasparasambaddhān karomi*): Ppp. has *śrevayāmi;* and in **d** (as in  
1 **d**) *sujātās*. The Anukr. should have noted the verse as *nicṛt*.  
⌊Read *yó vó ‘sti* in **a**?⌋

The inclination which your hearts have harboured, the purpose which hath occupied your spirits, This I annul with sacrifice and butter. In me be your sweet resting-place, O kinsmen.
