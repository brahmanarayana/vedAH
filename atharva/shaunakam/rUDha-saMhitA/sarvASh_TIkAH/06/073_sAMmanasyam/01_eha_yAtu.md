### Translation
1. Let Varuṇa come here, Soma, Agni; let Brihaspati with the Vasus come  
here; come ye together, \[his\] fellows, all of you, like-minded, unto  
the fortune of this stern corrector (*ugrá cettṛ́*).

### Notes
Ppp. reads *abhi-* instead of *upa-* in **c**, and has at the end  
*sujātās*. The comm. explains *cettṛ* as "one who properly understands  
the distinction of what is to be done and what is not to be done"; in  
this word *cit* seems to take the value of *ci* or *cāy:* 'one who notes  
and visits or requites.'
