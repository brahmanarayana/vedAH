### Translation
3. Let Vāiśvānara the purifier purify me, if (*yát*) I run against a  
promise, an expectation (*ācā́*), not acknowledging, begging with my  
mind; what sin is therein, that I impel away.

### Notes
The whole verse, this time, has its correspondent in TA. (ii. 6. 1²),  
which, however, reads for **a** *v. pávayān naḥ pavítrāir* (Ppp. means  
the same, but substitutes *pāvayā naṣ*); and has, in **d**, *átra* for  
*tátra* and *áva* for *ápa*. Ppp. has *saṁgalam* near beginning of  
**b**. The comm. reads *-dhāvāni* in **b**, and explains by  
*ābhimukhyena prāpnavāni;* the minor Pet. Lex. suggests emendation to  
*ati-dhāv-* 'transgress.' Ludwig emends *āśā́m* to *āsām* (referring to  
*devatāsu* in 2 **b**); the reading and *pada* division *ā॰śā́m* are  
vouched for by Prāt. iv. 72, to which rule the word is the  
counter-example; the comm. explains it by *devādīnām abhilāṣam*.  
⌊Bergaigne comments on root *sū*, *Rel. Véd.* iii. 44.⌋

Vaisvanara the Purifier purge me when I oppose their hope and break my promise, Unknowing in my heart. With supplication, whatever guilt there is in that, I banish.
