### Translation
2. I make it known to Vāiśvānara, if \[there is on my part\] promise of  
debt to the deities; he knows how to unfasten all these bonds; so may we  
be united with what is cooked (*pakvá*).

### Notes
The first three pādas have correspondents in TA. (ii. 6. 1¹), which  
reads, in **a, b**, *vedayāmo yádī nṛṇám*, and, in **c**, *pā́śān  
pramúcan* (i.e. *-cam*) *prá veda;* Ppp. also has *pra veda* instead of  
*veda sárvān*. Our **d**, which seems quite out of place here, occurs  
again at the end of xii. 3. 55-60, which see (TA. has instead *sá no  
muñcātu duritā́d avadyā́t*). The comm. explains *pakvena* here as  
*paripakvena svargādiphalena*, or the ripened fruit of our good works.  
The Anukr. seems to allow the contraction *sāi ‘tān* in **c**.

I cause Vaisvanara to know, confessing the debt whose payment to the Gods is promised. He knows to tear asunder all these nooses: so may we dwell with him the gentle-minded.
