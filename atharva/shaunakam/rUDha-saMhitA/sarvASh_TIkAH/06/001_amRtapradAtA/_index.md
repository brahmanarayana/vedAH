### Comment
All the mss.—and SPP., following them—put the avasāna-mark after dhehi, thus falsely dividing the irregular gāyatrī into two pādas ⌊12: 12⌋; hence, of course, they accent ā́tharvaṇa; and most of the pada-mss. (all save our Bp.) read -ṇaḥ (as if the combination -ṇa st- were made by the common and allowable loss of the final ḥ before st: but many of our saṁhitā-mss. also have -ṇaḥ st-; SPP. makes no such report as to his). Both the other texts make the proper division, after ātharvaṇa; and so does Ppp., reading also gāya for the obscure dhehi. Both SV. and AśS. have ā́  ’gād (which is better) for the first gāya; and SV. gives dyúmadgāman for dyumád dhehi. The comm. explains doṣo ⌊i.e. doṣā́ (instr.) u⌋ by rātrāv api, understands bṛhat as the sāman of that name, and supplies dhanam to dyumat in b. In our edition, the accent-mark over the sa of savitāram in c is lost.
