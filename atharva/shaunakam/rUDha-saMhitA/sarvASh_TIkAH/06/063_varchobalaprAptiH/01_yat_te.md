### Translation
1. The tie that the divine Nirṛti (perdition) bound upon thy neck,  
\[and\] that was unreleasable, that do I untie for thee, in order to  
long life (*ā́yus*), splendor, strength; do thou, quickened (*pra-su*),  
eat uninjurious (?) food.

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **b** *avicṛtyam*, omits *várcase*, which is metrically  
redundant and probably intruded, in **c**, and has, for **d**, *anamīvaṁ  
pitum addhi prasūtaḥ*, thus getting rid of the extremely obscure  
*adomadám* (made more obscure by the occurrence of *adomadhá* in viii.  
2. 18). The comm. takes *adomadam* as two independent words, and renders  
it 'producing pleasure for a prolonged time.' The translation given is  
that of the Petersburg Lexicons. A corresponding verse is found in VS.  
(xii. 65), TS. (iv. 2. 5³), and MS. ii. 7. 12. VS. and MS. have, in **a,  
b**, *yám...pā́śam;* VS. ends **b** with *avicṛtyám*, TS.MS. with  
*avicartyám* (all omitting *yát*). In **c**, for *tát te*, VS. MS. have  
*táṁ te*, and TS. *idáṁ te tát;* VS.TS. end it with *ā́yuṣo ná mádhyāt*,  
MS. with *-ṣo nú mádhye*. For **d**, TS.MS. have *áthā jīváḥ pitúm addhi  
prámuktaḥ*, VS. *áthāi ’tám pitúm addhi prásūtaḥ*. The verse has no  
*jagatī* character.

That collar round thy neck, not to be loosened, which Nirriti the Goddess bound and fastened, I loose for thy long life and strength and vigour. Eat, liberated, food that brings no sorrow.
