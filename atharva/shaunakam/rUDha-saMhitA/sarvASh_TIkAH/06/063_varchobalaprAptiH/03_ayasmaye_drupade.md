### Translation
3. Thou wast bound here to an iron post (*drupadá*), bridled with deaths  
that are a thousand. Do thou, in concord with Yama, with the Fathers,  
make this man ascend to the highest firmament.

### Notes
We have the same change of address here as in the preceding verse, and  
it proves that the make-up of the material as given by the Yajus texts  
is more original and correct. They read, in **c, d**, *yaména tváṁ  
yamyā́* (TS.MS. *-yā́*) *saṁvidānó ’ttamé* (TS. *-mám*) *nā́ke* (TS.  
*-kam*) *ádhi rohayāi ’nam* (TS. *-ye ’mám*). Ppp., as noticed above,  
has **c, d** of this verse as 2 **c, d**, reading *-dāno ’ttame nāke*  
(like V.S.MS.). The last pāda is found also as that of i. 9. 2, 4; xi.  
1. 4. With the contraction *bedhiṣe ’ha*, the verse would be a good  
*triṣṭubh*. ⌊The vs. recurs at vi. 84. 4.⌋

Compassed by death which comes in thousand manners, here art thou fastened to the iron pillar. Unanimous with Yama and the Fathers, make this man rise and reach the loftiest heaven.
