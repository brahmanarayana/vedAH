### Translation
4. Thou collectest together for thyself, O Agni, bull, all things from  
the foe (?); thou art kindled in the track of sacrifice (*íḍ*); do thou  
bring to us good things.

### Notes
This is a RV. verse, found at x. 191. 1 (vss. 2-4 are our next hymn),  
and is also to be met with at VS. xv. 30, TS. ii. 6. 11⁴, and MS. ii.  
13. 7—in all its occurrences offering precisely the same text. It was  
noticed above that it occurs in Ppp., but not in connection with the  
three preceding verses of this hymn—with which, indeed, it has nothing  
to do as regards sense. It was pointed out in the note to Prāt. ii. 72  
that the prescription in that rule of *s* as the final of only *iḍāyās*  
before *pada* seems a strong indication that this verse was not a part  
of the AV. text as recognized by the Prāt. The comm. explains *iḍas* by  
*iḍāyā bhūmyāḥ*. ⌊For consistency, *sáṁ sam* ought to be printed  
*sáṁ-sam*.⌋

Thou, mighty Agni, good and true, gatherest up all precious things. Bring us all treasures as thou art enkindled at libation's place.
