### Translation
3. Agni, in distant domains, the desire of what is and is to be, bears  
rule as the one universal ruler.

### Notes
Or, it may be (so Florenz), 'Agni, as Kāma, rules over what has been and  
is to be,' etc.; the comm. explains *kāmas* as *kāmayitā kāmaprado vā*.  
SV. (also VS. xii. 117) reads *priyéṣu* for *páreṣu* in **a**; AśS.  
(viii. 10.3) has instead *pratneṣu*. śśS. (iii. 5. 8) has our text  
without variant; also TB. (see above), in **b, c**. ⌊Cf. iii. 21. 4 and  
Muir, v. 403.⌋
