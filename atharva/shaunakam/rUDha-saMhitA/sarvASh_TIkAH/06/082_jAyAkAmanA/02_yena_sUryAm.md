### Translation
2. By what road the Aśvins carried Sūryā, daughter of Savitar, by that,  
Bhaga said to me, do thou bring a wife.

### Notes
In **b**, *aśvíno ”hátus* is perhaps better to be taken apart to  
*aśvínā: ā-ūhátus*, but the *pada*-text has no **ā**. ⌊Cf. Bergaigne,  
*Rel. Véd.*, ii. 486-7.⌋

Thus Bhaga spake to me: Let him bring thee a consort by the path. Whereon the Asvins brought the bride Surya the child of Savitar.
