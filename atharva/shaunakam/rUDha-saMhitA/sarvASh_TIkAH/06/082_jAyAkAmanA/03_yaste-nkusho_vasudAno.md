### Translation
3. The good-giving, great, golden hook that is thine, O Indra—with that,  
O lord of might (*śácī-*), assign thou a wife to me who seek a wife.

### Notes
Ppp. retains the *a* of *an̄kuśas*, and has, for **d**, *tvaṁ dhehi  
śatakrato*. The comm. reads, in **a**, *vasudhānas*.  
  
The eighth *anuvāka*, containing 10 hymns and 31 verses, ends with this  
hymn; the old Anukr. says: *ekatriṅśakam aṣṭamaṁ vadanti*.
