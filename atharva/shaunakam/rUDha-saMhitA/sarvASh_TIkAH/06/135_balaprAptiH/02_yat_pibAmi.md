### Translation
2. When I drink, I drink up, an up-drinker like the ocean; drinking up  
the breath of him yonder, we drink him up.

### Notes
Ppp. combines *samudrāi ’va* in **b**, and reads, in **c, d**, *saṁpivāṁ  
saṁpivāmy ahaṁ pivā*.

I drink together what I drink, even as the sea that swallows all. Drinking the life-breath of that man, we drink that man and swallow him.
