### Translation
1. When (*yát*) I eat, I make strength; thus do I take the thunderbolt,  
cutting to pieces (*śat*) the shoulders of him yonder, as Cachīpati of  
Vritra.

### Notes
*Skandhá* 'shoulder' is always plural ⌊in AV.⌋, and so is not precisely  
equivalent to the word used to render it. Ppp. has for **b**, *vajram  
anupātayati*. Pāda **b** is deficient unless we read *va-jṛ-am*.

Whate'er I eat I turn to strength, and thus I grasp the Thunder- bolt, Rending the shoulders of that man as Indra shattered Vritra's neck.
