### Translation
3. We have become united with splendor, with fatness (*páyas*), with  
bodies (*tanū́*), with propitious mind; let Tvashṭar make for us here  
wider room; let him smooth down what of our body is torn apart.

### Notes
This verse is found also in many other texts, its first half generally  
without variation; only PB. (i. 3. 9: this half-verse alone) has  
*tapobhis* for *tanūbhis* at end of **a**. VS. (ii. 24 et al.) has for  
**c, d**: *tváṣṭā sudátro vi dadhātu rā́yó ‘nu mārṣṭu tanvò yád  
víliṣṭam*, and the rest follow this rather than our text; only TA. (ii.  
4. 1) has *no átra* in **c**, and TS. (i. 4. 44) *no átra várivaḥ  
kṛṇotu;* MS. (i. 3. 38 et al.) and śśS. (iv. 11. 6) add *nas* (like AV.)  
after *ánu* in **d**, and MS. ends with *víriṣṭam* (TS., of course, has  
*tanúvas*). Ppp. has, in **c**, *sudatro varivaṣ kṛ-*, differing from  
all. The comm. renders *anu mārṣṭu* by *hastena śodhayatu*. ⌊Cf. von  
Schroeder's *Tübinger Kaṭha-hss.*, p. 72.⌋

We are again united with our bodies, with happy mind, with spirit, strength, and splendour. May Tvashtar here make room for us, and freedom and smooth whate'er is injured in our bodies.
