### Translation
1. Let both the sky now and the earth, forethoughtful—let the bright  
(*śukrá*) great one, by the sacrificial gift, rescue (*pṛ*) me; let the  
*svadhā́* favor (*anu-ci*) \[me, let\] Soma, Agni; let Vāyu protect us,  
\[let\] Savitar and Bhaga.

### Notes
For the embarrassing *ma idám* in **a**, Ppp. reads simply *mā*, which  
is better. TB., in its version of the verse (namely of **a, b, c**, ii.  
7. 8², 16²: each has a different **d**) has *tvā* instead, and inserts  
it again before *pipartu;* it also reads *prácetasā* at end of **a**,  
and *bṛhád dákṣiṇā* in **b**. "The bright one" is doubtless *soma;* the  
comm. explains it as *sūrya*, and to *dakṣiṇayā* supplies *diśā*. ⌊Cf.  
Bloomfield's remark on **b** at AJP. xvii. 409.⌋ The combination  
*anu-ci*, elsewhere unknown, must be the equivalent of *anu-jñā* or  
*anu-man* (the comm., *anujānātu*). Three of the pādas are *triṣṭubh*,  
but **a** has 13 syllables unless we contract *me ’dam*.

May Heaven and Earth, wise pair, may lofty Sukra grant me this thing by reason of the guerdon. May Agni, Soma mark through this libation: may Vayu, Savitar, and Bhaga guard us.
