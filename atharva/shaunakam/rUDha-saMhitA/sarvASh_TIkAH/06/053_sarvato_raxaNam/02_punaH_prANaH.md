### Translation
2. Again let breath, again let soul (*ātmán*) come unto us; again let  
sight, again let spirit (*ásu*) come unto us; let Vāiśvānara, our  
unharmed body-protector, stand between \[us and\] all difficulties.

### Notes
Compare TA. ii. 5¹⁷, MS. i. 2. 3, Āp. x. 18. 3, all of which have a  
different (and TA. a much longer) enumeration in **a, b**, with the verb  
*ā́ ’gāt* 'hath come.' In **c**, MS. and Āp. omit *nas*, TA. reads  
instead *me;* in **d**, for *antás tiṣṭhāti*, TA. and Āp. have *áva  
bādhatām*, MS. *ápa b-*. Ppp. agrees nearly with MS. by reading in **a**  
*punar manaḩ punar āyur na mā ”gaṅ;* in **c** it has *adbhutas* for  
*adabáhas;* its **d** is *antas tiṣṭhāsi duritād avadyāt;* and it  
combines *tanūpāntas*.⌋ ⌊Cf. also MGS. 1. 3. 2 and p. 152, s.v. *punar  
me;* and MB. i. 6. 34.⌋

Again return to us our breath and spirit, again come back to us our life and vision! Vaisvanara, unscathed, our bodies' guardian, stand between us and every woe and danger!
