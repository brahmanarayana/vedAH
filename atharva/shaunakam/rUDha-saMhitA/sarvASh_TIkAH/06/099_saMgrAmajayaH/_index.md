### Comment
[Partly prose, "vs." 3.⌋ Found also in Pāipp. xix. No use of the hymn is made by Kāuś. except in connection with its two predecessors, as explained under hymn 97. But Vāit. has it in the agniṣṭoma, as whispered stotra (18. 16).


### Translations
Translated: Grill, 18, 168; Griffith, i. 299; Bloomfield, 123, 510.
