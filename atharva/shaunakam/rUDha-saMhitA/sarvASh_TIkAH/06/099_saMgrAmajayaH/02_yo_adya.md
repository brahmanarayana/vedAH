### Translation
2. The hostile (? *sénya*) weapon that goes up today, desiring to slay  
us—in that case we put completely about us Indra's two arms.

### Notes
Ppp. reads at the beginning *yo ‘dya*, and at the end *pari dadmahe*,  
which rectifies the meter of **d**. The *pada* mss. strangely read  
*jighāṅsam* in **b**; both editions make the necessary emendation to  
*-san*, which the comm. also has. The comm. further has the better  
reading *dadhmas*, as have three of our mss. (Bp.M.T.); and this ⌊which,  
in connection with the Ppp. reading, suggests the emendation *dadhmahe*⌋  
is adopted in our text, though not in SPP's. The metrical irregularity  
of the verse should not have been overlooked by the Anukr. ⌊Cf. i. 20. 2  
**a, b**.⌋

Whatever deadly missile launched to-day flies forth to slaughter us. We take both arms of Indra to encompass us on every side.
