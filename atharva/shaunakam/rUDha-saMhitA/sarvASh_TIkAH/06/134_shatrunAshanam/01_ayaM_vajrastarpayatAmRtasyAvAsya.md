### Translation
1. Let this thunderbolt gratify itself with right (? *ṛtásya*), let it  
smite down his kingdom, away his life; let it crush \[his\] neck, crush  
up his nape, as Cachīpati of Vritra.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *vratena* instead of *ṛtasya* in **a**, meaning perhaps  
*mṛtena*, which would be a welcome improvement, suggesting emendation of  
our text to *-tām mṛtásya* 'on the dead man,' anticipating the result of  
the action imprecated in the next pāda. Ludwig translates as if it were  
*amṛtasya*, which is to be rejected. The comm. renders it simply  
'truth, or sacrifice,' and regards a staff (*dhāryamāṇo daṇḍaḥ*) as  
intended by *vajra;* in **b** he apparently overlooks and omits *ava*.  
The *pada*-reading at end of **c** is *uṣṇíhā*, as if for *-hāu*, dual;  
the comm. reads *-hāḥ*, which is doubtless the right form. Ppp. leaves  
off the last pāda, but whether it ends **c** with *uṣṇihāḥ* I am not  
informed. Ppp. also has *jīvam* for *jīvitam* in **b**, and *skandhā*  
for *grivās* in **c**. ⌊The Anukr. ignores the *jagatī* rhythm of **a**  
and **c**.⌋

This Thunderbolt shall take its fill of Order, scare life away and overthrow the kingdom. Tear necks in pieces. rend napes asunder, even as the Lord of Might the neck of Vritra.
