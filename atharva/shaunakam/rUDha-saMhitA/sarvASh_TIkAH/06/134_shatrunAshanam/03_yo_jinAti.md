### Translation
3. Whoever scathes, him seek thou after; whoever scathes, him smite; the  
crown of the scather, O thunderbolt, do thou cause to fall following  
after.

### Notes
The last pāda is very obscure; it is rendered as if it meant an  
involving of the offender's crown (*sīmanta:=śiraso madhyadeśa*, comm.)  
in the fall of the thunderbolt (but the comm. explains *anvañcam* by  
*anulomam!*). Ppp. reads *sāyakas* for *tvam* in **c**. The Prāt, gives  
an *obiter dictum* (iii. 43) on the derivation of *sīmánta* (or  
*sīmánt*). The metrical definition ⌊bhurig anuṣṭup⌋ seems to be omitted  
in the Anukr.

Seek out the fierce oppressor, yea, strike only the oppressor dead. Down on the fierce oppressor's head strike at full length, O Thunderbolt!
