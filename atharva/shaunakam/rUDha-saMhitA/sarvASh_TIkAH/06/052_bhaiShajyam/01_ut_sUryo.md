### Translation
1. The sun goes up from the sky, burning down in front the demons; he,  
the Āditya, from the mountains, seen of all, slayer of the unseen.

### Notes
All the mss. read *-jū́rvat* at end of **b**, but both editions make the  
nearly unavoidable emendation to *-van*, which the comm. also reads. The  
first half-verse in RV. is very different: *úd apaptad asāú sū́ryaḥ purú  
víśvāni jū́rvan* (should be *víśvā nijū́rvan?* ⌊rather, *víśvāni  
nijū́rvan?*⌋). Ppp. has *vivāni jūrvan*, and, for **c**, *ādityaṣ  
parvatāṅ abhi*. The "unseen" in **d** are, according to the comm., the  
demons and *piśācas* and the like. ⌊Whitney's M. reads *-jū́rvan.*⌋
