### Translation
1. As this draft-horse (*vāhá*), O Aśvins, comes together and moves  
together \[with his mate\], so unto me let thy mind come together and  
move together.

### Notes
The comm. paraphrases *vāhas* with *suśikṣito ’śvaḥ*, 'a well-trained  
horse,' but regards the driver (*vāhaka*) as the unexpressed object ⌊?  
or adjunct⌋ of the verbs—which is also possible.

Even as this ox, O Asvins, steps and turns together with his mate, So let thy fancy turn itself, come nearer, and unite with me.
