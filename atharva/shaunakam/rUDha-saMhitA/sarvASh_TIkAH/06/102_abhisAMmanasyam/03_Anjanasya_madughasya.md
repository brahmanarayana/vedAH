### Translation
3. Of ointment, of *madúgha*, of *kúṣṭha*, and of nard, by the hands of  
Bhaga, I bring up quick a means of subjection.

### Notes
The construction of the genitives in the first half-verse is obscure.  
The comm. makes them depend on *anurodhanam*, and so also Grill. They  
are perhaps rather the means by which the *anurodhana* (= *anulepana*,  
comm.) or gaining to one's purposes of the desired person is to be  
brought about, and so are coördinate with *Bhagasya*, the latter's  
'hands' taking the place of the 'means' or 'aid' which would have better  
suited them. *Turás* in **c** is possibly genitive, 'of quick' (or  
powerful) Bhaga (so the comm.: = *tvaramāṇasya*). Ppp. reads (as in  
other places) *madhugasya* in **a**; the comm. *madhughasya*. Ppp. has  
also *ā* for *ud* in **d**. Several of our mss. (P.M.I.O.T.) accent *ánu  
ródh-*, ⌊and so do six of⌋ SPP's authorities.  
  
The tenth *anuvāka*, of 10 hymns and 30 verses, ends here; the quoted  
Anukr. says simply *daśama*.  
  
Here ends also the fourteenth *prapāṭhaka*.

Swiftly from Bhaga's hands I bear away a love-compelling charm Of ointment and of sugar-cane, of Spikenard and the Kushtha plant.
