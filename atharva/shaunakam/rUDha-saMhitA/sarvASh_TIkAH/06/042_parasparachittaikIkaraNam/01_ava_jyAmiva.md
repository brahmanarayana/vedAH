### Translation
1. As the string from the bow, do I relax (*ava-tan*) fury from thy  
heart, that, becoming like-minded, we (two) may hold together (*sac*)  
like friends.

### Notes
The Ppp. version is in many points different: *ava jyām iva dkanvinaś  
śuṣmaṁ tanomi te hṛdaḥ: adhā sammanasu bhūtvā sakhike ’va sacāvahe*. The  
first half-verse occurs \[at MP. ii. 22. 3, with *hṛdas* transferred to  
the beginning of **b**;⌋ also in HGS. (i. 15. 3), with *dhanvinas* (like  
Ppp.), and with *hṛdas* transferred ⌊as in MP.⌋, and with *dyām* for  
*jyām*. In this verse and the next, the Anukr. does not allow the  
abbreviation *’va* after *sákhāyāu*.

I loose the anger from thy heart as 'twere the bowstring from a bow, That we, one-minded now, may walk together as familiar friends.
