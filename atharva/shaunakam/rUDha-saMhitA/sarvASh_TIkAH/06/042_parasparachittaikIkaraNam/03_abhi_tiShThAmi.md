### Translation
3. I trample upon (*abhi-sthā*) thy fury, with heel and with front foot,  
that thou mayest speak not uncontrolled, mayest come unto my intent.

### Notes
⌊I do not see why *prápada* may not here be rendered by 'toe.'⌋ Ppp.  
reads, for **b**, *pārṣṇibhyām prapadābhyām;* and, for **c, d**, *parā  
te dastyāṁ vadhaṁ parā manyuṁ suvāmi te*. ⌊The second half-verse recurs  
at the end of the next hymn. Pāda **d** is a stock-phrase: see i. 34. 2;  
iii. 25. 5; vi. 9. 2; 43. 3.⌋

I trample on thine anger thus, I tread it down with heel and toe: So dost thou yield thee to my will, to speak no more rebelliously.
