### Translation
2. We (two) will hold together like friends; I relax thy fury; we cast  
in thy fury under a stone that is heavy.

### Notes
Perhaps better 'thy fury that is heavy'; but the version of Ppp. ⌊with  
the comm.⌋ decidedly supports the translation as given: *aśmanā manyuṁ  
guruṇā ’pi ni dadhmasi*. Ppp's version of **a, b** is this: *vi te  
manyuṁ nayāmasi* ⌊cf. MP. ii. 22. 2⌋ *sakhike ’va sacāvahāi*.

Together let us walk as friends: thy wrathful feeling I remove. Beneath a heavy stone we cast thy wrath away and bury it.
