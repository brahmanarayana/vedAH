### Comment
The first verse (= iii. 8. 5; the four preceding verses of iii. 8 occurred elsewhere) is found in Pāipp. xix. The comm. regards it as intended by Kāuś. 12. 5, in a rite for harmony, as, in almost identical terms, he had above (under iii. 8) declared iii. 8. 5, 6 to be intended.


### Translations
Translated: Ludwig, p. 514; Griffith, i. 296; Bloomfield, 138, 508.
