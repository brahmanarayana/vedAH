### Translation
3. Worked in for me \[are\] heaven-and-earth; worked in \[is\] divine  
Sarasvatī; worked in for me \[are\] both Indra and Agni; may we be  
successful here, O Sarasvatī.

Save the last pāda, this verse is a repetition of v. 23. 1. The comm.  
paraphrases *ota* by *ābhimukhyena saṁtata* or *parasparaṁ saṁbaddha*.
