### Translation
1. Let not the snake, O gods, slay us with our offspring, with our men  
(*púruṣa*); what is shut together may it not unclose; what is open may  
it not shut together: homage to the god-people.

### Notes
Pādas **c** and **d** are found again below as x. 4. 8 **a, b**. ⌊Read  
*sáṁyataṁ yán ná ví ṣparad, viā́ttam yán ná* etc.?⌋ Ppp. reads in **b**  
*sahapāuruṣān*, and omits the concluding pāda. The comm. has *vi  
sphurat* in **c**; he understands the 'open' and 'shut' of the snake's  
mouth, doubtless correctly. MB. (ii. 1. 5) has a parallel phrase:  
*saṁhatam mā vivadhir vihatam mā ’bhisaṁvadhīḥ*.

Let not the serpent slay us, O Gods, with our children and our folk. Let it not close the opened mouth nor open that which now is closed.
