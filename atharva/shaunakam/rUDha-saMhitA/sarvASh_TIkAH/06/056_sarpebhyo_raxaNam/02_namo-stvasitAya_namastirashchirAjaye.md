### Translation
2. Homage be to the black \[snake\], homage to the cross-lined, homage  
to the brown constrictor; homage to the god-people.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *haye* for *astu* in **a**. The comm. explains *svaja*  
'constrictor' as "self-born" ⌊and Aufrecht as the "natural" color, that  
is, "green "⌋.

Be worship paid unto the black, worship to that with stripes across! To the brown viper reverence, reverence to the demon brood!
