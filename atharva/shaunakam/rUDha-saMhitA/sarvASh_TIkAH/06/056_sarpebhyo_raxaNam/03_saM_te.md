### Translation
3. I smite thy teeth together with tooth, thy (two) jaws together with  
jaw, thy tongue together with tongue, thy mouth, O snake, together with  
mouth.

### Notes
Ppp. reads at the beginning *saṁ te dadāmi dadbhir datas*, omits *u* in  
**b**, and ends with *āsnāhasyam*. The comm. understands "thy lower  
teeth with thine upper tooth," and so in the other cases: but this is  
very unacceptable; and more probably the tooth, jaw, etc. are said of  
some object or instrument used in the incantation.

I close together fangs with fang, I close together jaws with jaw. I close together tongue with tongue, I close together mouth with mouth.
