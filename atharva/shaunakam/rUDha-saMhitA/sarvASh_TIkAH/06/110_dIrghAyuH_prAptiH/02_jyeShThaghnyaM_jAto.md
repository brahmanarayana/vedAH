### Translation
2. Born in *jyeṣṭhaghnī́*, in Yama's two Unfasteners (*vicṛ́t*)—do thou  
protect him from the Uprooter (*mūlabárhaṇa*); may he conduct him across  
all difficulties unto long life, of a hundred autumns.

### Notes
The consecutiveness of the verse is very defective, inasmuch as 'born'  
(*jātás*, nom.) in **a** can hardly be understood otherwise than of the  
child, while Agni is addressed in **b**, and spoken of in third person  
in **c, d**. Three asterisms are here ⌊and in 112⌋ referred to, all in  
our constellation Scorpio: Antares or *Cor Scorpionis* (either alone or  
with σ, τ) is usually called *jyeṣṭhā* 'oldest,' but also (more  
anciently?), as an asterism of ill omen, *jyeṣṭhaghnī* 'she that slays  
the oldest'\*; *mūla* 'root,' also in the same manner *mūlabarhaṇī* ⌊or  
*-ṇa*⌋, lit. 'root-wrencher,'\* is the tail, or in the tail, of which  
the terminal star-pair, or the sting (λ, υ), has the specific name  
*vicṛtāu*. ⌊See note to ii. 8. i.⌋ The comm. takes *yamasya* as  
belonging to *mūlabarhaṇāt*. By a misprint, our text begins with *jyāi-*  
(read *jye-*). \*⌊See TB. i. 5. 2⁸.⌋
