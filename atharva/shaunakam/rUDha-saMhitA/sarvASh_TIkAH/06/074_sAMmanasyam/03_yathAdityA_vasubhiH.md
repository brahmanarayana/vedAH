### Translation
3. As the Ādityas, severe (*ugrá*), not bearing enmity, united with the  
Vasus, with the Maruts, so, O three-named one, not bearing enmity, do  
thou make these people here like-minded.

### Notes
Ppp. reads, in **a**, *vasavas* instead of *vasubhis*, and, in **c, d**,  
*-yamānam imaṁ janā saṁmanasaṁ kṛṇu tvam*, which is better in so far as  
it makes *ahṛṇ-* adjunct of the object rather than of the subject in the  
sentence; our text desiderates *ahṛṇīyamānān*. The verse is found also  
in TS. (ii. 1. 11³), which has, in **b**, *marúdbhī rudrā́ḥ* (our reading  
seems a corruption of this) *samájānatā ’bhí;* and, in **c, d**,  
*-yamānā víśve devā́ḥ sámanaso bhavantu*. A god *triṇāman* appears to be  
met with only in this verse; the one meant is probably Agni, as  
conjectured by BR., and also explained by the comm.

As, free from jealousy, the strong Adityas have been the Vasus' and the Rudras' fellows. So free from jealousy, Lord of Three Titles! cause thou these people here to be one-minded.
