### Translation
2. Concurrence of the mind for you, also concurrence of the heart, also  
what of Bhaga is wearied (*śrāntá*)—therewith I make you concur.

### Notes
Ppp. has, in **d**, *saṁ jñapayāti mām*. It is one of the most peculiar  
and unaccountable of the occasional peculiarities of the *pada*-text  
that in **d** it reads *sám॰jñapayāmi*, combining the preposition with  
the verb, though the former has the accent. Of all the mss. noted, only  
one of SPP's has the usual reading.\* *śrāntám* in **c** seems an  
impossible reading, but even Ppp. gives nothing else. The comm. explains  
it as 'toil-born penance' (*śramajanitaṁ tapaḥ*). Emendation to  
*śāntam* 'tranquillized,' i.e. tranquillity, would be very easy, and  
tolerably satisfactory. \*⌊Whitney's collation certainly notes also  
D.Kp. as reading *sám:jñapayāmi;* probably his eye rested on the  
*sam॰jñápanam* of **b** (which in his collation-book stands just above  
the *sám॰jñapayāmi* of **d**), when he wrote the above statement. I  
suspect that the *avagraha* of *sám॰jñapayāmi* has blundered in from the  
*sam॰jñápanam* of **a** and **b** by a similar mistake of the scribes.⌋  
⌊Cf. the *pada* reading *úpa॰śekima* at vi. 114. 2.⌋
