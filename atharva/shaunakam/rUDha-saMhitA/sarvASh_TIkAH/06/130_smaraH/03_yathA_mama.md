### Translation
3. That yon \[man\] may love me, not I him at any time, ye gods, send  
etc. etc.

### Notes
SPP's *pada*-ttxt, probably by an oversight, leaves *amuṣya* unaccented;  
the comm. undauntedly explains it by *amūṁ striyam*.

That he may think of me, that I may never, never think of him,. Send forth the spell, ye Deities! Let him consume with love of me.
