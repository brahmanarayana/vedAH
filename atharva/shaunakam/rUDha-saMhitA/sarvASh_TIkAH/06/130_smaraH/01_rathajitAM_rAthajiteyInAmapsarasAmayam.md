### Translation
1. Of the Apsarases, chariot-conquering, belonging to the  
chariot-conquering, \[is\] this the love (*smará*): ye gods, send forth  
love; let yon \[man\] burn for (*anu-śuc*) me.

### Notes
Our *pada*-mss. (and three of SPP's) make in a the absurd division  
*rātha॰jite: yī́nām*, for which the comm. reads *rathājite dhīnām* (=  
*rathena jetavye māṣākhye oṣadhi;* and *dhyānajananīmām*). The two terms  
(of which one is an evident derivative of the other) have so little  
applicability to the Apsarases that Grill resorts to the violent and  
unacceptable measure of substituting *arthajítām ārthajitī́nām*. Perhaps  
nothing more is meant than to mark strongly the all-conquering power  
postulated for the Apsarases in this spell. Ludwig renders *smara* by  
"love-charm." The comm., in spite of *priyas* in 2 **b** and *amuṣya* in  
3 **b**, thinks it a woman whose love is sought.

This is the Apsarases' love-spell, the conquering, resistless ones'. Send the spell forth, ye Deities! Let him consume with love of me.
