### Translation
2. Let yon \[man\] love (*smṛ*) me; being dear, let him love me: ye  
gods, send etc. etc.

### Notes
At the end of pādas **a** and **b** is added *íti*, not translated; it  
appears to indicate an expression of the purpose for which the gods are  
to despatch love. The comm. combines vss. 2 and 3 into one verse, thus  
restoring the norm of the book; but the Anukr. calls the hymn one of  
four verses, and that is plainly its value in the present state of the  
text. ⌊Here the comm., alternatively, allows that it may be a man whose  
love is sought.⌋

I pray, may he remember me, think of me, loving and beloved. Send forth the spell, ye Deities! Let him consume with love of me.
