### Translation
1. The arrow that Rudra hurled at thee, at thy limbs and heart, that do  
we now thus eject asunder from thee.

### Notes
Ppp. has, for **c**, *imāṁ tvām adya te vayam*. The comm. understands  
the infliction to be the *śūlaroga* (colic?). ⌊In **c**, *idám*, 'thus'  
or 'herewith' i.e. 'with this spell'?⌋
