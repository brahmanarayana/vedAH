### Translation
1. Savitar here hath come with razor; come, O Vāyu, with hot water; let  
the Ādityas, the Rudras, the Vasus, wet \[him\] in accordance; do ye,  
forethoughtful, shave \[the head\] of king Soma.

### Notes
'Wet,' corresponding to our 'lather.' Dignity is sought to be given to  
the operation by identifying the participants in it with various  
divinities. The second pāda is given, without variation, in AGS. i. 17.  
6 and PGS. ii. 1. 6; the first and second are found in GGS. ii. 9. 10,  
11, MB. i. 6. 1, 2, with *agāt* in **a**, and *-kenāi ’dhi* in **b**.  
Ppp. has, in **b**, *vāyav udakena ehi*, and omits *undantu* in **c**.  
The combination *vāya ud-* is quoted under Prāt. ii. 21, 24; iii. 35;  
*-kené” ’ hi*, under iii. 38, 66. ⌊Hillebrandt, *Ved. Mythol.*, i. 472,  
may be consulted.⌋
