### Translation
3. With what razor the knowing Savitar shaved \[the head\] of king Soma,  
of Varuṇa, therewith, ye priests (*brahmán*), shave \[it\] now of this  
man; be he rich in kine, in horses, in progeny.

### Notes
Ppp. reads, for **d**, *aśyāmodīyur ayam astu vīraḥ*. AGS. (i. 17. 10)  
and PGS. (ii. 1. 11) have our **a, b, c** without variant, but add as  
**d**, *āyuṣmāñ jaradaṣṭir yathā ’ sat*. TB. (ii. 7. 17²) also has the  
verse, differing only in **d**: *ūrjé ’ máṁ rayyā́ várcasā sáṁ sṛjātha;*  
and with this HGS. (ii. 6. 10) agrees throughout. The śGS. version ⌊i.  
28⌋ differs throughout: *yenā ’ vapat savitā śmaśrv agre kṣureṇa rājño  
varuṇasya vidvān: yena dhātā bṛhaspatir indrasya cā ’ vapac chiraḥ: tena  
brahmāṇo vapate ’ dam adyā ”yuṣmān dīrghāyur ayam astu vīraḥ* (agreeing  
at the end with Ppp.). MB. (i. 6. 7) has a still other text: *yena pūṣā  
bṛhaspater vāyor indrasya cā ’vapat: tena te vapāmi brahmaṇā jīvātave  
jīvanāya dīrghāyuṣṭvāya varcase*. The verse (10 + 11: 11 + 12 = 44)  
contains no *atijagatī* element. ⌊Ppp. combines *asyā ’śyāmodīyur;* and  
R. notes that **c, d** appears in Ppp. ii.⌋
