### Translation
3. Indra's force, the Maruts' front (*ánīka*), Mitra's embryo, Varuṇa's  
navel—do thou, enjoying this oblation-giving of ours, O divine chariot,  
accept the oblations.

### Notes
All the other versions have *vájras* for *ójas* in '**a**, and Ppp.  
agrees with them. All, too (not Ppp.), combine *sé ’mā́m* at beginning of  
**c**, against the requirement of the meter. The GB. quotes (i. 2. 21)  
the *pratīka* of this verse in its form as given by our text. ⌊Ppp. has  
*dharuṇasya* for *vár-* in **b**.⌋
