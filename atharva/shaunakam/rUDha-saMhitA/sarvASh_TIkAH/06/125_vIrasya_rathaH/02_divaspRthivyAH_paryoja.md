### Translation
2. Forth from heaven, from earth \[is its\] force brought up; forth  
from forest-trees \[is its\] power brought hither; to the force of the  
waters, brought forth hither by the kine, to Indra's thunderbolt, the  
chariot, do thou sacrifice with oblation.

### Notes
Or all the nouns ("force" and "power" in **a, b** as well) are to be  
taken as accusatives with *yaja* 'sacrifice to.' Ppp. reads *ābhṛtaṁ* at  
end of **a**, and *parisambhṛtaṁ* in **b**. All the other versions have  
the better reading *ā́vṛtam* at end of **c**; and so has the comm.,  
followed by three of SPP's mss.; and it is accordingly adopted in SPP's  
text. MS. reads *ā́vṛtam* also in **b**, and *antárikṣāt* instead of *ója  
údbhṛtam* in **a**. TS.VS. have *diváḥ p-* at the beginning. The comm.  
refers to TS. vi. i. 3⁴ as authority for identifying the chariot with  
Indra's thunderbolt.

Its mighty strength was borrowed from the heaven and earth: its conquering force was brought from sovrans of the wood. Honour with sacrifice the Car like Indra's bolt, the Car girt round with straps, the vigour of the floods.
