### Translation
3. Let the divine Aśvins, lords of beauty, protect us; let  
dawn-and-night also make broad for us; O child of the waters, in case of  
any detriment to \[our\] household; O divine Tvashṭar, increase \[us\]  
in order to our completeness.

### Notes
Ppp. has, in **a**, *sudaṅsasā* for *śubhas patī;* and in **c, d** it  
reads *vihvṛtī kayasya cid devo ‘sūvandadhite śarma yacha naḥ*. The  
comm. partly agrees with it in reading *abhihvṛtī* and *kayasya*  
(explaining it as for *kasya*); it also has at the beginning *pātam*,  
and takes the nouns that follow as vocatives. It understands *ábhihvṛtī*  
(p. *-tī íti*) as a locative (= *-hvṛtāu* or *-hvaraṇe*), as is done in  
our translation ⌊cf. JAOS. x. 389⌋. The accent requires amendment, to  
*abhíhrutī*. Florenz suggests the substitution of *abhihrútas*, which  
would be an easier reading.

Preserve us both the Asvins, Gods and Lords of Light, and let the Dawns and Night bring us deliverance. The Waters' Child protect our house from every harm. Do thou, God Tvashtar, make us strong for health and wealth.
