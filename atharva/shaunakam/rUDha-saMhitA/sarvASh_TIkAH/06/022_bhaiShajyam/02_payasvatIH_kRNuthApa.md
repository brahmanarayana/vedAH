### Translation
2. Ye make the waters rich in milk, the herbs propitious, when ye bestir  
yourselves, O golden-backed Maruts; do ye lavish (*pinv*) both  
sustenance and good-will there, where, O manly Maruts, ye pour honey.

### Notes
The first, third, and fourth pādas are found as **b, c, d** of a verse  
in TS. iii. 1. 11⁸; TS. reads *kṛṇuta* (as does also Ppp.), and it omits  
*śivā́s;* it also has, with the comm., *pinvatha* in **c** (which is  
better). Ppp. further reads *yamās* for *śivās*, and *ejati* for *-thā*;  
⌊and *siñcatā* for *-thā*⌋.

Ye make floods rich in milk, make plants propitious, what time ye stir, O golden-breasted Maruts! Pour down your showers of vigorous strength and favour there where ye sprinkle mead, O Maruts, heroes!
