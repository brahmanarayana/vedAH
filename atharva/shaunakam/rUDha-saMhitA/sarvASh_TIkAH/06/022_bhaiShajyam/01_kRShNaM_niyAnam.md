### Translation
1. Black the down-track, the yellow eagles, clothing themselves in  
waters, fly up to the sky; they have come hither from the seat of  
righteousness (*ṛtá*); then, forsooth, with ghee they deluged the earth.

### Notes
The verse comes from the mystic and obscure hymn RV. i. 164 (vs. 47),  
and is found again twice below (ix. 10. 22, which see; xiii. 3. 9). It  
is also found in several of the Black Yajus texts: TS. (iii. 1. 11⁴),  
MS. (iv. 12. 5), K. (xi. 9, 13). RV.MS. end with *pṛthivī́ vy ùdyate;*  
TS. has *ásitavarṇās* (for *kṛṣṇā́ṁ niyā́nam*) in **a**, *míhas* (for  
*apás*) in **b**, *sádanāni kṛtvā́* in **c**, and, for **d**, *ā́d ít  
pṛthivī́ ghṛtāír vy ùdyate*. Ppp. agrees with RV.MS. at the end of the  
verse, and it combines, in its frequent way, *suparṇā ’po*.

Dark the descent; the strong-winged birds are golden: they fly aloft to heaven, enrobed in waters. They have come hither from the seat of Order, and inundated earth with streams of fatness.
