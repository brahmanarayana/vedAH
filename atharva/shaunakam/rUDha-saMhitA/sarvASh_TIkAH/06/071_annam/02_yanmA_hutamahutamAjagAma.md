### Translation
2. Whatever, offered \[or\] unoffered, hath come to me, given by the  
Fathers, assented to by human beings (*manuṣyà*), what my mind is as it  
were excited at—let Agni the offerer make that well-offered.

### Notes
The comm. reads *rārajītu* in **c**, but explains it as an indicative.  
The mss. are divided between *manuṣyāìḥ* (which both editions give) and  
-*yāíḥ* at the end of **b** (our Bp.P.M.H.T.K. have the latter). Ppp.  
inserts *yat* after *hutam* in **a**. ⌊W. has here overlooked a part of  
R's note, which (if I understand him) means that our vs. 2 continues in  
Ppp. thus: (**b**) *yasmād anna manaso ’drārajīmi*, (**c**, a corruption  
of TA's **c** given under vs. 1 above) *yad devānāṁ cakṣuṣākaśīnā*,  
(**d**) *’gniṣ* etc.⌋
