### Translation
1. What food of various form I eat oftentimes (*bahudhā́*)—gold, horse,  
also cow, she-goat, sheep, just whatsoever I have accepted—let Agni the  
offerer (*hótar*) make that well-offered.

### Notes
Ppp. has, in **c**, *kiṁ cit*, and for **d**, *a. t. viśvād agadaṁ k.*  
TA. (ii. 6. 2¹²) has pādas **a, b, c** as **a, b, d** of a verse of five  
pādas: in **b** it inserts *vā́sas* (Ppp. *vāusu*) before *híraṇyam* and  
omits (not Ppp.) *áśvam* after it; after **b** it inserts *yád devā́nāṁ  
cákṣuṣy ā́go ásti;* in **c** it contracts *-jagráhā ’hám* into  
*-jagrāhám;* and it ends with *agnír mā tásmād anṛṇáṁ kṛṇotu*. The comm.  
(unless it is a misprint) reads *jagrāha* in **c**. The last pāda is x.  
9. 26 **d**. The first two vss. are mixed *jagatī* and *triṣṭubh*.
