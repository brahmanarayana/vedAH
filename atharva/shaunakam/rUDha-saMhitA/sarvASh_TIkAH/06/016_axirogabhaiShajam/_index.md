### Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xix. Appears in Kāuś. (30. 1), in a healing rite, explained as intended for disease of the eyes, with various use of mustard plant. Verse 4 is quoted alone later (51. 15), in a rite explained by Keś. simply as one for welfare, by the comm. as for welfare in connection with food (annasvastyayana): and the comm. reads in Kāuś. anna- (not āla-) bheṣajam; the three śalāñjālāgrāṇi of 51. 16 the comm. explains as sasyavallīs.


The whole hymn is totally obscure; that it relates to a disease of the eyes, as assumed by the native comment, there appears no good reason to believe.
