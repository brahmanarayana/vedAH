### Translation
4. *Alasálā* art thou first; *silā́njālā* art thou after; *nīlāgalasálā*.

### Notes
This verse is wanting in Pāipp. (save so far as its last word is found  
in that version of vs. 2). The comm. understands the three obscure words  
it contains to be names of grain-creepers (*sasyavallī*); he gives the  
second the slightly different form *śalān̄jālā*. The comment to Prāt. iv.  
107 quotes *alasālā ’si* as instancing the indispensableness of the  
*pada*-text to a student; but what good it does him in this instance is  
quite unclear. Our Bp. gives the third pāda thus: *nīlāgalasā́lé ’ti  
nīlāgalasā́lā*. The verse is capable of being read as 8 + 7: 6.
