### Translation
2. *Vihálha* by name is thy father, *madávatī* ('intoxicated') by name  
is thy mother; for thou art he, not thyself, thou that didst consume  
thyself.

### Notes
SPP. reads in **a** *viháhlas*. The translation of the second half-verse  
implies the altered division and accentuation of **c** that is made in  
our edition; the mss. read *sá hina* (not divided in *pada*-text) *tvám  
asi;* and SPP. follows them. Ppp. has for **c** *śevas tvam asi* (its  
**d** is like ours), but it omits **a, b**, and, on the other hand, adds  
at the end *babhruś ca babhrukarṇaś ca nīlākalaśālāśavaṣ paścā*. The  
comm. reads *vihaṅla* for *vihalha* (which is supported by the  
commentary to Prāt. i. 46) in **a**, and regards *hi na* as two words in  
**c**. The verse as it stands (8 + 9: 6 + 8 = 31) is very improperly  
passed as a simple *anuṣṭubh*. ⌊An *ási* between *hí* and *ná* would  
mend the meter of **c** if such stuff were worth mending.⌋

Vihalha is thy father's name, thy mother's is Madavati. Yea, verily thou art not he, thou who hast well protected life.
