### Translation
2. As the earth \[is\] dead-minded, more dead-minded than a dead man,  
and as \[is\] the mind of one who has died, so of the jealous man the  
mind \[be\] dead.

### Notes
"Feeling" would be in this verse an acceptable equivalent for *manas*  
'mind.'

Even as the earth is dead to sense, yea, more unconscious than the dead, Even as a corpse's spirit is the spirit of the jealous man.
