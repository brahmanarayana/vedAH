### Translation
1. The first blast of jealousy, and the one after the first, the fire,  
the heat of the heart—this we extinguish for thee.

### Notes
Ppp. has readings in part better: for **b**, *madhyamām adhamām uta;*  
for *agnim* in **c**, *satyaṁ;* at end, *nir mantrayāmahe*. The comm.  
explains *dhrājim* by *vegayuktāṁ gatim*.
