### Translation
2. We pain thy heart; we pain thy mind; as smoke the wind, close upon it  
(*sadhryàñc*), so let thy mind go after me.

### Notes
The sign in our text denoting *kampa* in *sadhryàñ* should have been,  
for consistency's sake, 1 (as in SPP's text) and not 3; the mss., as  
usual, vary between 1 and 3 and nothing. The comm. reads *sadhrim*.

We make thy spirit sorrowful, we fill thy mind with pain and grief. As smoke accompanies the wind, so let thy fancy follow me.
