### Translation
1. This head that is love's (? *preṇí*), virility given by Soma—by what  
is engendered out of that, do we pain (*śocaya*) thy heart.

### Notes
*Preṇí* is as obscure to the comm. as to us; he paraphrases it by  
*premaprāpaka* 'that obtains (or causes to obtain) affection.' He takes  
*vṛṣṇya* as adj., treats *pari prajātena* in **c** as one word, and  
supplies to it *snehaviśeṣeṣa*. ⌊Whitney's O. combines *tátas pári*.⌋

This strength that Soma hath bestowed, the head of her who gladdeneth,-- With that which thence hath been produced we make thy spirit sorrowful.
