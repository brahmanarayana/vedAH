### Translation
1. If (*yát*) atmosphere, earth, and sky, if father or mother we have  
injured (*hiṅs*), may this householder's-fire lead us up from that to  
the world of the well-done.

### Notes
The first half-verse is found, without variation, in a number of other  
texts: in TS. (i. 8. 5³), TB. (iii. 7. 12⁴), TA. (ii. 6. 2⁸), MS. (i.  
10. 3), AśS. (ii. 7. 11); they do not agree entirely in the second half  
which they put in place of ours. Ppp. agrees with some of them, reading  
*agnir mā tasmād enaso gārhapatyah pramuñcatu*. Only **b** is really  
*jagatī*.

If we have injured Air, or Earth, or Heaven, if we have wronged our Mother or our Father, May Agni Garhapatya here absolve us, and bear us up into the world of virtue.
