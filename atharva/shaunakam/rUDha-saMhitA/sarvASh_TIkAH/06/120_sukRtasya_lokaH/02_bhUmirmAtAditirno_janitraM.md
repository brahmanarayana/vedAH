### Translation
2. May mother earth, Aditi our birthplace, brother atmosphere, \[save\]  
us from imprecation; may our father heaven be weal to us from paternal  
\[guilt\]; having gone to my relatives (*jāmí*), let me not fall down  
from \[their?\] world.

### Notes
The verse is found also in TA. (ii. 6. 29), which reads at end of **a**  
*ábhiśasta énaḥ;* and, in **c, d**, *bhavāsi jāmi mitvā́* (*jāmím itvā́?*)  
*mā́ vivitsi lokā́n:* the variants are of the kind that seem to show that  
the text was unintelligible to the text-makers, and that we are  
excusable in finding it extremely obscure. Ppp. brings no help.\* Our  
translation implies in **b** *abhiśastyās*, but the *pada* reading is  
*abhí॰śastyā*, as if instr.; the comm. understands *-tyās*. Our *pada*  
mss. also leave *mā* unaccented in **d**. Ludwig and Grill supply  
*lokāt* to *pitryāt:* "from the paternal world." The comm. divides  
alternatively *jāmi mṛtvā* and *jāmim ṛtvā*. The verse is a good  
*triṣṭubh*, though capable of being contracted to 40 syllables. \*⌊Grill  
reports a Ppp. reading *trātā* for *bhrā́tā*, although I do not find it  
in Roth's collations. Might it represent a *trā́tv antárikṣam?*⌋
