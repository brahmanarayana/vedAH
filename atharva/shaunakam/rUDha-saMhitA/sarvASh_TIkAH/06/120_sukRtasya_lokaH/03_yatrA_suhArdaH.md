### Translation
3. Where the well-hearted, the well-doing revel, having abandoned  
disease of their own selves, not lame with their limbs, undamaged in  
heaven (*svargá*)—there may we see \[our\] parents and sons.

### Notes
⌊The first half we had at iii. 28. 5.⌋ The verse corresponds to TA. ii.  
6. 2¹⁰, which reads *mádante* at end of **a**, *tanvā̀ṁ svā́yām* at end of  
**b**, *aśloṇā́n̄gāir* (so Ppp. also) in **c** (also *áhṛtās*, but this is  
doubtless a misprint ⌊he Poona ed. reads in fact *áhrutā*⌋), and  
*pitáraṁ ca putrám* at the end. The comm. reads *tanvās* in **b**, with  
part of the mss. (including our P.M.I.O.), and *aśroṇās* in **c**. ⌊For  
the substance of the vs., cf. Weber, *Sb.* 1894, p. 775.⌋

There where our virtuous friends, who left behind them their bodily infirmities, are happy, Free from distortion of the limbs and lameness, may we behold, in heaven, our sons and parents.
