### Translation
1. The god that bound on this girdle, that fastened \[it\] together  
(*sam-nah*), and that joined (*yuj*) \[it\] for us, the god by whose  
instruction we move—may he seek the further shore, and may he release  
us.

### Notes
Ppp. has in **c** the singular *carāmi*. 'Further shore' is a familiar  
expression for the end of a difficult or dangerous act or process  
(*prāripsitasya karmaṇaḥ samāptim,* comm.). *Tásya* at beginning of c  
in our text is a misprint for *yásya*. ⌊The Anukr. refuses to sanction  
the contraction *ye ’mām*.⌋

By the direction of that God we journey, he will seek means to save and he will free us; The God who hath engirt us with this Girdle, he who hath fast- ened it, and made us ready.
