### Translation
3. Since I am death's student (*brahmacārín*), soliciting from existence  
(? *bhūtá*) a man (*púruṣa*) for Yama, him do I, by incantation  
(*bráhman*), by fervor, by toil, tie with this girdle.

### Notes
It is the duty of a Vedic student to beg provision for his teacher. Ppp.  
begins **b** with *bhūtāu niryācan*. The comm. reads *niryācam*,  
explaining it as first person sing. (= *yāce*)! The result he takes to  
be "by this binding on of a girdle I impede the progress of my enemy."  
Pāda **c** has a redundant syllable.

As I am now Death's Brahmachari claiming out of the living world a man for Yama, So with Austerity and Prayer and Fervour I bind this Girdle round the man before me.
