### Translation
3. As the sun's rays fly away swiftly, so do thou, O cough, fly forth,  
after the outflow of the ocean.

### Notes
In all these verses, all the authorities anomalously accent the  
vocative, *kā́se;* our edition makes the called-for emendation to *kāse;*  
SPP. reads *kā́se*.

Rapidly as the beams of light, the rays of Surya, fly away, So, Cough! fly rapidly away over the current of the sea!
