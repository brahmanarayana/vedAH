### Translation
1. They who sit about him, who pile on \[fuel\] in order to beholding  
\[him\]—let Agni, fully kindled, with his tongues arise out of \[their\]  
heart.

### Notes
The sense is somewhat obscure. In **b**, *cákṣase* probably 'that he may  
become conspicuous'; the comm. very strangely renders it 'for injury'  
(*hiṅsāyāi*) and regards the "they" as demons and the like. Ppp. begins  
*yene ’daṁ par-*, and elides the **a** of *agnir* in **c**.

Those who are sitting round this babe prepare him to be looked upon. Let Agni thoroughly inflamed with all his tongues rise from his- heart.
