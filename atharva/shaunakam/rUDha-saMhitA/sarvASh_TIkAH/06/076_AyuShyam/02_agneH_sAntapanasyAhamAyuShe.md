### Translation
2. Of the heating (? *sāṁtapaná*) Agni I take hold of the track (?  
*padá*), in order to length of life (*ā́yus*)—out of whose mouth the  
soothsayer (*addhātí*) sees the smoke arising.

### Notes
Ppp. reads, for **c, d**, *dhātur yasya paśyata mama dyantaś śritaḥ*,  
corrupt. The comm. explains *pada* as either 'place' (*sthāna*) or  
'sound' (*śabda*).
