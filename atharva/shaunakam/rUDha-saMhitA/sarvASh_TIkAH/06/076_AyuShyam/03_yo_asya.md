### Translation
3. He who knoweth the fuel of him, piled on by the *kṣatríya*—he setteth  
not the foot (*padá*) in detriment unto death.

### Notes
Ppp. elides the initial *a* of *asya* in **a**, and begins **c** *mā  
vihvare*. To the comm., *abhihvāra* is 'a roundabout crooked cause of  
meeting death.'
