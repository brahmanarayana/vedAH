### Translation
2. O Indra, put this man far forward; may he be controler of his  
fellows; unite him with abundance of wealth; conduct him unto life  
(*jīvā́tu*), unto old age.

### Notes
In **a**, VS.TS. have again *pratarā́m;* VS. MS. have *naya* for *kṛdhi;*  
for **c** (as already noted), VS.TS. have our 1 **c**; for **d**, MS.  
has *devébhyo bhāgadā́ asat*, VS. and TS. nearly the same, VS.  
substituting *devā́nām*, and TS. *-dhā́;* Ppp. has, for **d**, our 1  
**d**. The meter of **d** might be rectified by abbreviating *jīvā́tave*  
to *-tvāi* (a form found in MS.śB. and Āp.), or by emending it to  
*jīvā́tum*.

Advance him, Indra! Let him be ruler of all akin to him. Grant him sufficiency of wealth: guide him to life and length of days.
