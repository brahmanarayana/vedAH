### Translation
3. In whose house we make oblation, him, O Agni, do thou increase; him  
may Soma bless, and this Brahmaṇaspati.

### Notes
The three Yajus texts have, in **a**, *kurmás* for *kṛṇmás*, and VS.MS.  
(with Ppp.) put *havís* after *gṛhé*. In **c**, all three have *devā́  
ádhi bravan* (but MS. *bruvan*). The last half-verse occurs below, as  
87. 3 **c, d** (corresponding to RV. x. 173. 3 etc.).
