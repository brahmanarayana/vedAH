Found also in Pāipp. xix. Besides the uses in Kāuś. of hymns 97-99, as stated under 97, hymn 98 is further applied, with vi. 67, in another battle rite (16. 4); and the schol. add it to vii. 86, 91, etc., in the indramahotsava (note to 140. 6). Vāit. also (34. 13) has it in the sattra, when the king is armed.
