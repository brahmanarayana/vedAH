### Translation
1. May Indra conquer, may he not be conquered; may he king it as  
over-king among kings; be thou here one to be famed, to be praised, to  
be greeted, to be waited on, and to be reverenced.

### Notes
The verse is found also in TS. (ii. 4. 14²) and MS. (iv. 12. 3), but  
with a very different second half: **c**, TS. *víśvā hí bhūyā́ḥ pṛ́tanā  
abhiṣṭī́r, MS. víśvā abhiṣṭíḥ pṛ́tanā jayaty;* **d**, both *upasádyo  
namasyò yáthā́ ’sat*. In the first half, at end of **a**, MS. *jayate;*  
at end of **b**, TS. *rājayāti*, MS. *-yate*. The last pāda occurs again  
as iii. 4. 1 **d**. The comm. regards the king as identified with Indra  
through the hymn. ⌊MS. has *jayati* for *jayāti*.⌋
