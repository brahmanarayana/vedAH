### Translation
3. This third libation \[is\] of the poets (*kaví*), who rightfully  
(*ṛténa*) sent out the bowl; let those Sāudhanvanas, who have attained  
heaven, conduct our happy-offering unto what is better.

### Notes
That is (**a**), of the Ribhus, one of whose merits, leading to the  
conferral of immortality upon them, was their service to the ceremonial  
in connection with the libational bowl, which they made four. ⌊For this  
the comm. gives ample citations, e.g. RV. i. 161. 2.⌋ Ppp. combines, in  
**c**, *sāudhanvanā ’mṛtā ”naśānās*, and ends the verse with *nayātha*.  
TS. has the insignificant variants of *súvar* in **c**, and *vásīyas* in  
**d**; KśS. (x. 3. 21) reads *tṛtīya-savanam* in **a**, and *no ‘bhi  
vasīyo n-* in **d**.

We pour this third libation of the Sages who fashioned forth the cup in proper order. Winners of heaven, may they, Sudhanvan's children, lead our fair sacrifice to happy fortune.
