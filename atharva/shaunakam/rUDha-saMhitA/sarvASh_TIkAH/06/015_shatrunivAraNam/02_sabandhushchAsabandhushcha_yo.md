### Translation
2. Whoever, both kindred and not of kin, assails us, of them may I be  
highest, as this one of trees.

### Notes
The Ppp. version of i. 19. 4 **a, b** is (as pointed out at that place)  
nearly our **a, b** here. In this verse Ppp. reads *samb-* and *asamb-*,  
and its **c** is *sambandhūn sarvāṅs tīn tvā*.

Whoever seeks to injure us, with kinsmen or no kin to aid, May I be uppermost of all, even as this Plant is queen of trees.
