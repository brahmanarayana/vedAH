### Translation
1. Thou art the highest of herbs; of thee the trees are subjects  
(*upastí*); let him be our subject who assails us.

### Notes
The verse is RV. x. 97. 23 (with which VS. xii. 101 precisely agrees),  
which has, for **a**, *tvám uttamā́ ’sy oṣadhe*, and accents *úpastayas  
úpastis*. Ppp. elides the *a* of *asi* in **a**, and in **c, d** has  
*upastir asmākaṁ bhūyād yo ‘sman*. The comm. regards the *palāśa* tree  
as addressed.

Most excellent of all the plants art thou: thy vassals are the trees. Let him be subject to our power, the man who seeks to injure us.
