### Translation
3. As of herbs soma is made highest of oblations, as the *talā́śā* of  
trees, \[so\] may I be highest.

### Notes
Ppp. reads, for **b, c**, *uttamaṁ havir ucyate* (which is better):  
*yavā tvam āiva vṛkṣāṇām*. The comm. has *palāśa* in **c**. If *talā́śā*  
is a good reading, it may mean the same as *tālīśā* (*Flacourtia  
cataphracta*).
