### Translation
1. With tying-up, with tying-together, we tie up the enemies; the  
expirations and breaths of them, lives with life (*ásu*) have I cut off.

### Notes
The translation implies *acchidam* at the end, instead of *-dan*, which  
all the authorities (and hence both editions) read, save the comm.,  
which has *-dam*. Ppp. has in **c, d**, *teṣāṁ prāṇān samāsūn  
amamasutam* (corrupt). One might conjecture *asinā* for *asunā* in  
**d**.

We bind our foemen with a bond that binds them close and holds them fast. Their breath and respiration I dissever, and their lives from life.
