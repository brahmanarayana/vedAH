### Translation
3. Let Indra-and-Agni tie them up, and king Soma, allied; let Indra with  
the Maruts make tying-up for our enemies.

### Notes
Ppp. has for **b** the better version *rājñā somena medinā* (the  
construction of our *medināu* being anomalous); also *me* for *nas* at  
the end. Some of the *pada* texts (including our D.Kp.) read *enām* in  
**a**, and the *saṁhitā* mss. generally *enāṁ* instead of *enān;* the  
comm. gives *enān*. The comm. explains *medināu* badly by *medasvināv  
asmābhir dattena haviṣā mādyantāu vā*.

Indra and Agni bind them fast, Soma the King, and both the Friends! May Indra, girt by Maruts, make a bond to bind our enemies.
