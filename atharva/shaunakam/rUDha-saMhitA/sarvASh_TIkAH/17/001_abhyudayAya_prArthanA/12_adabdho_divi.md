### Translation
12. Unharmed in the heaven (*dív*), also on earth, art thou; they have  
not attained thy greatness in the atmosphere; increasing with unharmed  
worship (*bráhman*), do thou there, O Indra, being in the heaven  
(*dív*), bestow protection (*śárman*) on us.—Thine, O Vishṇu etc. etc.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *divaṣ p-* in **a**. ⌊in **d**, all of SPP's authorities give  
*ṣáṅ* or *sán:* and W's Collation Book notes nothing to the contrary;  
but⌋ the comm. omits the word, as the meter plainly requires. The verse  
(11 + 12: 11 + 12: 34 = 80) is by number of syllables an exact *kṛti*.

In heaven and on the earth thou art uninjured, none reach thy greatness in the air's mid region. Increasing by inviolate devotion as such in heaven grant us pro- tection, Indra. Manifold are thy great deeds, thine, O Vishnu.
