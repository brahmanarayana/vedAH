### Translation
28. Encompassed with worship \[as\] defense am I, with Kaśyapa's light  
and splendor; let not the arrows that are the gods' attain me, nor those  
of men, let loose in order to slay (*vadhyā́ya*).

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
SPP. reports his *pada*-mss. as reading *yā́* instead of *yā́ḥ* at end of  
**c**; I have not observed the blunder in ours. All, both his and ours,  
give *áva॰sṛṣṭā* instead of *-ṭāḥ* in **d**. The comm. adds the  
*visarga* in both words. A part of the verse is wanting in Ppp.

Compassed am I with prayer, my shield and armour; compassed with Kasyapa's bright light and splendour. Let not shafts reach me shot from heaven against me, nor those sent forth by men for my destruction.
