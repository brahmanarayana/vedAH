### Translation
8. Let them not damage thee in the sea, within the waters—they who  
approach there having fetters; quitting imprecation, thou hast ascended  
that sky; be thou then gracious to us; may we be in thy favor.—Thine, O  
Vishṇu etc. etc.

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **b** *pāśinam*, and in **c** *ā ruha etān*. The verse  
counts most naturally 78 syllables (11 × 4: 34); a proper *atidhṛti* has  
76. Bp. reads in d *ā́; rukṣaḥ;* D.Kp. and all SPP's authorities have *ā́;  
ar-*, which is doubtless the true *pada*-text.

Let not the fowlers who are standing ready injure thee in the flood, within the waters. Ascend this heaven, leaving each curse behind thee, Favour us: let thy gracious love attend us. Manifold are thy great deeds, thine, O Vishnu.
