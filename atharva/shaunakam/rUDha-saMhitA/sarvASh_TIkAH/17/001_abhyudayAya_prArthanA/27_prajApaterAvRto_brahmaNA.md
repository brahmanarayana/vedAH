### Translation
27. With Prajāpati's worship (*bráhman*) \[as\] defense am I covered,  
with Kaśyapa's light and splendor; long-lived, of finished heroism,  
vigorous (? *víhāyas*), having a thousand life-times, well-made, may I  
go about.

### Notes
⌊Or, to bring out the connection between *varman* and *āvṛta*, one may  
render, 'with P's defense am I defended,' 'with P's covering am I  
covered.'⌋ It is plain that *bráhmaṇā*, which is metrically redundant,  
has slipped in here out of 28 **a**; but it appears to be found also in  
Ppp., as in the text of the comm. The latter explains *víhāyās* by  
*vividhagamanaḥ, sarvatrā ’pratibaddhagatiḥ;* ⌊cf. Bergaigne, *Rel.  
Véd.* iii. 287⌋. The verse (14 + 11: 11 + 10 \[or 11?\] = 46) has  
nothing of a *jagatī* character; ⌊but, if we excise *bráhmaṇā*, it is a  
perfectly good *triṣṭubh*⌋.
