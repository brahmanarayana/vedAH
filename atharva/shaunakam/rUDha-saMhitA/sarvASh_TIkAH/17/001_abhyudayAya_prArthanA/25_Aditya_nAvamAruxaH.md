### Translation
25. O Āditya, thou hast ascended a boat of a hundred oars in order to  
well-being; thou hast made me to pass over the day, make thou me  
likewise (*satrā́*) to pass over the night.

### Notes
The comm. explains *satrā́* by *sahāi ’va, ahnā saha;* he gives also as  
admissible alternative explanation "I have ascended thee as a boat"  
etc., understanding the second person to be used as a first! Ppp. reads,  
in fact, *ā ’ruham;* and, in **c**, *ahar ṇo ‘ty*.

Thou for our weal, Aditya, hast mounted thy ship with hundred oars. Thou hast transported me to day: so bear me evermore to night.
