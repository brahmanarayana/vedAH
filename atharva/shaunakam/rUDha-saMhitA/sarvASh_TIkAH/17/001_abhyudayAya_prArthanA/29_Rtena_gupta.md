### Translation
29. Guarded by righteousness and by all the seasons, guarded by what is  
and by what is to be am I; let not evil attain me, nor death; I  
interpose with a sea of speech.

### Notes
That is, I set my uttered charms like a sea between me and them.

Guarded am I by Order and the Seasons, protected by the past and by the future. Let not distress, yea, let not Death come nigh me: with water of my speech have I o'erwhelmed them.
