### Translation
22. To the rising one be obeisance; to the one coming up be obeisance;  
to the arisen one be obeisance; to the wide ruler (*virā́j*) be  
obeisance; to the self-ruler (*svarā́j*) be obeisance; to the universal  
ruler (*samrā́j*) be obeisance.

### Notes
We should expect, by the analogy of the next verse, *udeṣyaté* for  
*udāyaté*. The comm. explains the latter by *ūrdhvam īṣad gacchate*. In  
Vāit. 11. 16, the verse accompanies worship of the rising sun in the  
*agniṣṭoma* ceremony. It is so far an *anuṣṭubh* that it contains 32  
syllables. ⌊The Anukr. informs us that this verse is a *yajus;* and so  
of the next. A similarly isolated bit of information we had concerning  
xvi. 8. 1 **a**.⌋

Glory to him when rising, when ascending! Glory to him when he hath reached the zenith! To him far-shining, him the self-refulgent, to him the Sovran Lord and King be glory!
