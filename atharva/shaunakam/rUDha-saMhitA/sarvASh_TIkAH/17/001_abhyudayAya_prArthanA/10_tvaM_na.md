### Translation
10. Do thou, O Indra, with propitious aids, be most wealful to  
us—ascending to the triple heaven of the heaven (*dív*), besung unto  
soma-drinking, having a dear abode (*-dhā́man*) unto well-being.—Thine, O  
Vishnu etc. etc.

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **a** *indro adbhiś* (*ś-*). The comm. gives us our choice  
between *-sthāna* and *-tejas* as meanings of *-dhāman* in **e**. The  
verse has two syllables too many for a regular *dhṛti* (72); ⌊it reads  
properly as 5 × 8 and 34; but pāda **a** may be read as 6⌋.

Be thou most gracious unto us, Indra, with favourable aid, Rising to heaven's third sphere, invoked with song to quaff the Soma juice, loving thy home to make us blest. Manifold are thy great deeds, thine, O Vishnu.
