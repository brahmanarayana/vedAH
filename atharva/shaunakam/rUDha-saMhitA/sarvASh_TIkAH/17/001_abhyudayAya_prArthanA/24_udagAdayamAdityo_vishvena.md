### Translation
24. This Āditya hath arisen, together with all ardor (*tápas*), making  
subject to me my rivals; and let me not be subject to my hater.—Thine, O  
Vishṇu etc. etc.

### Notes
We have repeated here once more the refrain of vss. 6-19. The verse is  
wanting in Ppp. Pādas **c, d** are nearly identical with our 6 **c, d**  
above. ⌊The main stock of the vs., without the refrain, corresponds to⌋  
RV. i. 50. 13, which reads *sáhasā* in **b**, and *dviṣántam* (for  
*sapátnān*) in **c**; also *mó* for *mā́ ca* in **d**; ⌊and it is also  
TB. iii. 7. 6²³, quoted above in full under vs. 6, which reads like RV.,  
save that it has *máma* for *máhyam* in **c**, and *dviṣató* for  
*dviṣaté* in **d**.—In the Calcutta ed. of TB., *sáhasā* is misprinted  
*máhasā* in the text, but is given aright in the comm. (p. 504), and  
aright in the Poona ed., p. 1105.⌋

With all his fiery fervour this Aditya hath gone up on high, Giving my foes into my hand. Let me not by my foeman's prey. Manifold are thy great deeds, thine, O Vishnu. Sate us with cattle of all varied colours. Set me in happiness, in loftiest heaven.
