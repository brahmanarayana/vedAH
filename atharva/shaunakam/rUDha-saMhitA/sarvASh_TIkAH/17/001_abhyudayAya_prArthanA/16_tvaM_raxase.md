### Translation
16. Thou defendest the four directions; thou shinest abroad with  
brightness (*śocis*) unto the two firmaments (*nábhas*); thou pursuest  
(*anusthā*) all these beings; thou, knowing, followest (*anu-i*) the way  
of righteousness.—Thine, O Vishṇu etc. etc.

### Notes
The *saṁhitā*-mss. read *vidvā́ṅs távé ’d* between verse and refrain. The  
whole (11 + 11: 12 + 11: 34 = 79) reads naturally as three more  
syllables than belong to an *atidhṛti*.
