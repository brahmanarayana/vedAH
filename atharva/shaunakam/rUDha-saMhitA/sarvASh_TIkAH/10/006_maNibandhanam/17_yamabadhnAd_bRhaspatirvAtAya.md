### Translation
17. What amulet Brihaspati bound on for the swift wind, that healthful  
amulet here the deities fastened on; it yields to them everything, more  
and more etc. etc.

### Notes
Part of our mss. (Bp.P.W.I.D.K.) ⌊and a great majority of SPP's⌋ read  
*amuñcata* in **d**. ⌊The error has doubtless crept in by confusion with  
the oft repeated *abadhnata* below and perhaps with the *amuñcata* of  
vs. 15. Cf. my note to vi. 74. 2.⌋

The Amulet Brihaspati formed for the swiftly-moving Wind, This salutary Amulet the Deities assumed and wore. This yieldeth them the universe, again, again, from morn to morn. With this subdue thine enemies.
