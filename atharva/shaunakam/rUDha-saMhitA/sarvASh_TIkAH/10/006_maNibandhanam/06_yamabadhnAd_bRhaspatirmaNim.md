### Translation
6. What amulet, plow-share, ghee-dripping, the formidable *khadirá*,  
Brihaspati bound on, in order to force—that Agni fastened on; it yields  
(*duh*) to him sacrificial butter, more and more, morrow after morrow;  
with that do thou slay thy haters.

### Notes
The series of epithets in **b, c** is an obscure one; perhaps 'made of  
*khadira*-wood and shaped like a plow-share,' is meant; the comm. to  
Kāuś. 19. 23 says *khādiryāś cibukāyāḥ kartavyaḥ*. Ppp. reads after  
**d** *ājyāya rasāya kam: so ‘smā ājyaṁ duhe*. There is no reason why  
the Anukr. should call the verse *virāj*.
