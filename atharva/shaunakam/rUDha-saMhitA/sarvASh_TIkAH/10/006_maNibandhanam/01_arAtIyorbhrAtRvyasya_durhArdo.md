### Translation
1. The head of the niggardly (*arātīyú*) cousin, of the evil-hearted  
hater, I cut off with force.

### Notes
The hymn (vs. 1) is quoted in Kāuś. 19. 22, with 3 and a couple of yet  
earlier hymns. At 8. 12, also, the verse is used in connection with the  
preparation of the *darbha*-sickle. Further, it is reckoned (note to  
Kāuś. 19. 1) as a *puṣṭika* mantra. In Vāit. 10. 2, it accompanies the  
cutting of a sacrificial post.
