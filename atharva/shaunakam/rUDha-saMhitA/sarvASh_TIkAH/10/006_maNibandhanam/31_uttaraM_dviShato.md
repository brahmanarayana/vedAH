### Translation
31. Let this god-born amulet make me superior to my hater; whose  
milked-out milk these three worlds worship, let that amulet mount here  
upon me, in order to supremacy, at the head.

### Notes
That is, probably, 'mount upon my head.' According to Prāt. ii. 65, we  
ought to read *maṇíṣ kṛ-;* ⌊this is the reading of three of SPP's mss.,  
but of none of W's so far as noted: both texts give *maṇíḥ*⌋. The pāda  
*sa mā ’yam adhi rohatu* (31 **e**, 32 **c**) is quoted in the comm. to  
Kāuś. 19. 25. The Anukr. takes no notice of the redundant syllable in  
**a**. Ppp. reads, for **e**, *sa tvā ’yam abhi rakṣatu*.

May this Chaim, offspring of the Gods, make me superior to my foe. So may this charm whose milk expressed these three worlds longingly await, Be fastened on me here, that it may crown me with surpassing power.
