### Translation
11. What amulet Brihaspati bound on for the swift wind, that yields him  
vigor (*vā́jina*), more and more etc. etc.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
A number of our mss. (I.O.R.D.) read *vājínam* in **c**. ⌊So do the  
great majority of SPP's, and he adopts it in his text. But four of his  
read *vā́jinam*.⌋ In this batch of verses (11-17) Ppp. has sundry  
unimportant exchanges and variants; the details are not given.
