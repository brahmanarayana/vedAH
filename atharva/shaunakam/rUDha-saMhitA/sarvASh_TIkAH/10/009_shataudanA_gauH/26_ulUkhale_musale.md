### Translation
26. What in the mortar, on the pestle, and on the hide, or what  
rice-grain, \[what\] kernel in the winnowing-basket, or what the wind,  
Mātariśvan, blowing (*pū*), shook (*math*)—let Agni as *hótar* make that  
well-offered.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
It is very much out of place to reckon five pādas (12 + 9: 8 + 7 + 11 =  
47) in this verse; but the *pada*-ms. supports the Anukr., by making a  
mark of pāda-division after *mātaríśvā;* evidently either this word or  
*pávamānas* (rather the former) is an intrusion in **c**. ⌊The last pāda  
we had as vi. 71. 1 **d**.⌋ The verse is quoted in Vāit. 4. 9; also  
(with vi. 122, 123) in Kāuś. 63. 29, to accompany the closing libations.  
Ppp. reads in **b** *ye vā śūrpe taṇḍulāṣ kaṇāḥ*.

Each grain of rice in mortar or on pestle, all on the skin or in the winnowing-basket, Whatever purifying Matarisvan, the Wind, hath sifted, let the Hotar Agni make of it an acceptable oblation.
