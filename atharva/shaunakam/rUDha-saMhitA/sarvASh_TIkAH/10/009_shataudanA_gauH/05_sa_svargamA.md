### Translation
5. He ascends the heavenly road (*svargá*), where is yon triple heaven  
of the heaven (*dív*), who, making \[her\] cake-naveled, gives her of  
the hundred rice-dishes.

### Notes
The meaning and connection of **c** are not very clear. Ludwig renders  
"and makes her the middle point of the *apūpa*," which is against the  
accent; probably 'adding cakes numerous enough to cover her.' ⌊Is it not  
virtually equivalent to 'putting a cake on her navel,' as preparatory to  
sacrificing her?⌋ Ppp. has hiraṇyajyotiṣam instead of *apūpanābhim* (cf.  
the next verse). The resolution *kṛtu-ā́*, necessary to make the verse a  
regular *anuṣṭubh*, is rather harsh.
