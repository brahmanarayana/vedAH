### Translation
25. Let thy two breasts (*kroḍá*) be sacrificial cakes, smeared over  
with sacrificial butter; having made them wings, O divine one, do thou  
carry him who cooks thee to heaven (*dív*).

### Notes
The Anukr. very strangely ignores the two resolutions in **b** and  
**c**, and reckons the pādas as 7 syllables each.

Sprinkled with molten butter, let the two meal-cakes be sport for thee. Make them thy wings, O Goddess, and bear him who dresses thee to heaven.
