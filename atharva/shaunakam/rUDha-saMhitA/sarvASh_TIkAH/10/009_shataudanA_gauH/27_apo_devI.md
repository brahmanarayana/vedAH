### Translation
27. The heavenly waters, rich in honey, dripping with ghee, I seat in  
separate succession in the hands of the priests (*brahmán*); with what  
desire I now pour you on, let all that fall to my lot; may we be lords  
of wealth.

### Notes
Ppp. begins **a** with *imā āpo madh-*, and **c** with *yatkāme ’dam*.  
Compare the verses vi. 122. 5 and xi. 1. 27, which are in part  
coincident with this; ⌊also MGS. i. 5. 4 and Index under *devīr āpo*.  
The verse (rather than i. 4. 3, which has the same *pratīka*) is quoted  
in Kāuś. 65. 8, to accompany the setting of water pots. The metrical  
definition of the Anukr. suits well enough.  
  
⌊The quoted Anukr. says "*aghāyatām*": cf . vs. 1.⌋

In the priest's hands I lay, in separate order, the sweet celestial Waters, dropping fatness. As here I sprinkle them may all my wishes be granted unto me in perfect fulness. May we have ample wealth in our posses- sion.
