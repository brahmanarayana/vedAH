### Translation
18. What marrow is thine, what bone, what flesh, and what blood—let  
them yield etc. etc.

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **a** *yāny asthīni*, thus rectifying the meter. The  
Anukr. does not notice the lacking syllable in the pāda. *Yás* at the  
beginning is again emendation for the *yát* of all the mss. ⌊both W's  
and SPP's⌋.
