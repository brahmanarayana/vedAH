### Translation
6. He obtains those worlds, \[those\] which are heavenly and ⌊those⌋  
which are earthly, who, having made \[her\] lighted with gold, gives her  
of the hundred rice-dishes.

### Notes
Ppp. reads for **b** *yeṣa devās samāsate*, and has *apūanābhim* here in  
**c**, instead of in 5 **c**.
