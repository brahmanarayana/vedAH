### Translation
3. In what member of him is situated the earth? in what member is  
situated the atmosphere? in what member is the sky set? in what member  
is situated what is beyond the sky?

### Notes
This is one of the five verses (3-6, 9) which are left by the Anukr. to  
fall under the general description of the hymn as *trāiṣṭubham*. All of  
them are more or less redundant; this, for example, is as much *bhurij*  
as vs. 2, which was so described. Ppp. puts the verse before our 2.
