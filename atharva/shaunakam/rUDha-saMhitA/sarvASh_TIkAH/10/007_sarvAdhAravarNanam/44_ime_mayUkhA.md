### Translation
44. These pegs propped up the sky; the chants they made shuttles for  
weaving.

### Notes
See the note to the preceding verse. Both here and in 42 **b** some of  
the mss. read *mayūṣa*. Bp. reads at the end *yā́tave*. The Anukr. says  
of the verse *ime mayūkhā ity ekāvasānā pañcapadā nicṛt padapan̄ktir*  
⌊i.e. 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 4 = 24⌋ *ārcy anuṣṭub dvipadā vā* ⌊i.e. 12 + 12 =  
24⌋ *pañcapadā nicṛt padapan̄ktir iti*. ⌊The last three or four words  
seem to be mere repetition.⌋  
  
⌊The quoted Anukr. says *caturdaśa* (i.e. 14 over 30).⌋
