### Translation
4. Whither desiring to attain does Agni flame aloft? whither desiring to  
attain blows Mātariśvan? whither desiring to attain, the turns (*āvṛ́t*)  
go, that Skambha tell \[me\]: which forsooth is he?

### Notes
Here we have two syllables in excess, unnoticed by the Anukr. Many of  
the mss. accent *svít* in **d**.

Whitherward yearning blazeth Agni upward? Whitherward yearning bloweth Matarisvan? Who out of many, tell me, is that Skambha to whom with long- ing go the turning pathways?
