### Translation
1. In what member of him is penance situated? in what member of him is  
right (*ṛtá*) deposited? where is situated \[his\] vow (*vratá*), where  
his faith? in what member of him is truth established?

### Notes
Ppp. combines in **a** *tapo ‘sya*. In **b**, the *pada*-text reads  
*asya: ádhi: ā́॰hitam*. There is no reason for calling the verse *virāj*.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
2. From what member of him flames Agni? from what member blows (  
  
  
*pū*  
  
  
) Mātariśvan? from what member doth the moon measure out, measuring the  
member of great Skambha?  
  
  
  
  
*Skambha*, lit. 'prop, support, pillar,' strangely used in this hymn as  
frame of the universe or half-personified as its soul. Ppp. reads in  
**d** *skambhasya mahan mim-*. ⌊Read *vimímāno* in **d**?⌋
