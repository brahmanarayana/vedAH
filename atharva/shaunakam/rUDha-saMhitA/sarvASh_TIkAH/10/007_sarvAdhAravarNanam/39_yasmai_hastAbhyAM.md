### Translation
39. Unto which with the two hands, with the two feet, with speech, with  
hearing, with sight; unto which the gods continually render (*pra-yam*)  
tribute, unmeasured in the measured out—that *skambhá* tell \[me\]:  
which forsooth is he?

### Notes
Notwithstanding the discordance of case, *vímite* is perhaps coordinate  
with *yásmāi*. Ppp. omits the first two pādas. The dual and the  
repetition of *yásmāi* make it probable that we have to supply in them  
'one renders tribute,' or the like. The Anukr. takes no notice of the  
redundant syllable in **d**.

Who out of many, tell me, is that Skambha. To whom the Deities with hands, with feet, and voice, and ear, and eye. Present unmeasured tribute in the measured hall of sacrifice?
