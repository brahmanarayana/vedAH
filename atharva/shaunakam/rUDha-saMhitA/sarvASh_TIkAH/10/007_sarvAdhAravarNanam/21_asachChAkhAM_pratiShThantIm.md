### Translation
21. The branch of the non-existent, standing forth, people know as in a  
manner the highest thing; also the lower ones who worship (upa-ās) thy  
branch think \[it?\] the existent thing.

### Notes
The translation of .this highly obscure verse is only mechanical, and as  
literal as possible. Ppp. has only the first half. The definition of the  
Anukr. is a strange one; the verse is only a *bhurig anuṣṭubh* (in  
virtue of the *iva*, which properly is to be reduced to *va*, making a  
regular *anuṣṭubh*).

Men count as 'twere a thing supreme nonentity's conspicuous branch; And lower man who serve thy branch regard it as an entity.
