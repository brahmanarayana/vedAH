### Translation
30. In Indra the worlds, in Indra penance, in Indra right is set; thee,  
O Indra, I know plainly \[as\] all established in the *skambhá*.

### Notes
The translation implies emendation in **c** of *índram* to *índra*. Of  
course, it is possible to render *índram* here, and *skambhám* in 29  
**c**, but where the whole sense is so mystically obscure alterations  
help little.

On Indra Fervour rests, on him the worlds and Holy Law recline. Indra, I clearly know that all of thee on Skambha findeth rest.
