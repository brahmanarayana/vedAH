### Translation
14. Where the first-born seers, the verses, the chant, the sacrificial  
formula, the great one (*mahī́*); in whom the sole seer is fixed—that  
Skambha etc. etc.

### Notes
*Mahī́* usually designates the earth; what in this connection it should  
be meant to apply to is doubtful. All the *saṁhitā*-mss. combine  
*ekarṣír* (Ppp. *eka ṛṣir*), but most of them, with the Anukr., *yátra  
ṛ́ṣ-* in **a**. Ppp. reads *bhūtakṛtas* for *prathamajas*.

Who out of many, tell me, is that Skambha. In whom the Sages earliest born, the Richas, Saman, Yajus, Earth, and the one highest Sage abide?
