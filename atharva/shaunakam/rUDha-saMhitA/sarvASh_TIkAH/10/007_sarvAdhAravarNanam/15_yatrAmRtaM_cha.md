### Translation
15. Where both immortality (*amṛ́ta*) and death are set together in man  
(*púruṣa*), of whom the ocean, the veins (*nāḍī́*) are set together in  
man, that Skambha etc. etc.

### Notes
Ppp. reads, for **b**, *puruṣaś ca samāhitāḥ*, and puts the verse after  
our 16. Read in **a** *mṛtyúś ca* (an accent-sign slipped out of place).

Who out of many, tell me, is the Skambha. Who comprehendeth, for mankind, both immortality and death, He who containeth for mankind the gathered waters as his veins?
