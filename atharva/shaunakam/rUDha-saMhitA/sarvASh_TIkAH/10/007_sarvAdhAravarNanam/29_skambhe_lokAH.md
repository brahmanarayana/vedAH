### Translation
29. In the *skambhá* the worlds, in the *skambhá* penance, in the  
*skambhá* right is set; thee, O *skambhá*, I know plainly \[as\] set all  
together in Indra.

### Notes
The mss. are much at variance in regard to *skámbha* in **c**; all save  
W. (the poorest and least trustworthy of all) end the word with *m*, and  
O.s.m.D. accent *skambhám*. That *skámbha* is really intended can hardly  
admit of question; Ppp. appears to read it.

On Skambha Fervour rests, the worlds and Holy Law repose on him. Skambha, I clearly know that all of thee on Indra is imposed.
