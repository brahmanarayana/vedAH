### Translation
24. Where the *bráhman*-knowing gods worship the chief *bráhman*—whoso  
verily knoweth them eye to eye (*pratyákṣam*), he may be a Brahman  
(*brahmán*), a knower.

### Notes
Perhaps an acceptable emendation in **d** would be *bráhma:* i.e. 'he  
may be (may be regarded as) one knowing the *bráhman*': cf. śB. xiv. 6.  
9¹¹. Ppp. reads, for **c, d**, *yo vāi tad brahmaṇo veda taṁ vāi  
brahmavido viduḥ*. Read in **a** *devā́* (an accent-sign dropped out).
