### Translation
43. Of them, as of two women dancing about, I do not distinguish  
(*vi-jñā*) which is beyond; a man (*púmāṅs*), weaves it, ties \[it\] up;  
a man hath borne it about upon the firmament (*nā́ka*).

### Notes
The last two pādas, with 44, correspond to RV. x. 130. 2, which reads:  
*púmāṅ enaṁ tanuta út kṛṇatti púmān ví tatne ádhi nā́ke asmín: imé  
mayū́khā úpa sedur ū sádaḥ sā́māni cakrus tásarāṇy ótave*. Our *úd  
gṛṇatti* is only a corruption, but simulates a form from root *grath*,  
and is rendered accordingly. ⌊For the exchange of surd and sonant, cf.  
Roth, ZDMG. xlviii. 110 and note to ii. 13. 3.⌋ The true scanning in  
**a** is doubtless *-yanti-or ’va;* ⌊better *-tior iva*, with *jagatī*  
cadence?⌋.

Of these two, dancing round as 'twere, I cannot distinguish whether ranks before the other. A Male in weaves this web, a Male divides it: a Male hath stretched it to the cope of heaven
