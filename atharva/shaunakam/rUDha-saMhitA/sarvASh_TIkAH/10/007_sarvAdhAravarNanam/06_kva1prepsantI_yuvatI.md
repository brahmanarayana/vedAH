### Translation
6. Whither desiring to attain run in concord the two maidens (*yuvatí*)  
of diverse form, day-and-night? whither desiring to attain, the waters  
go, that Skambha tell \[me\]: which forsooth is he?

### Notes
Here it is only the last pāda that is one syllable in excess. Ppp. puts  
the verse before our 5.

Whitherward yearning speed the two young Damsels, accordant, Day and Night, of different colour? Who out of many, tell me, is that Skambha to whom the Waters take their way with longing?
