### Translation
24. Thou art a girl, *tāúdī* by name; verily thou art by name ghee-like  
(*ghṛtā́cī*); I take beneath thy poison-spoiling track.

### Notes
That is, possibly, 'I put it beneath me, walk in it.' The obscure  
*tāudī* (ultimately from *tud* 'thrust'?) is read also by Ppp., which  
combines *vā ’si* in **b**, and has the easier reading *pados* for  
*padam* in **c**.
