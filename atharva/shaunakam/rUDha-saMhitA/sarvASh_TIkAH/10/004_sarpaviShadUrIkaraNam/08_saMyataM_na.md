### Translation
8. What is shut together may it not open; what is opened may it not shut  
together; in this field \[are\] two snakes, both a female and a male;  
those \[are\] both sapless.

### Notes
The first half-verse we had above as vi. 56. 1 **c, d** ⌊see note for  
suggested emendation⌋, also applied to a snake. The curiously irregular  
verse (7 + 7: 8 \[7?\] + 11 = 33) is strangely defined by the Anukr.

Let him not close the opened mouth, nor open that which now is closed. Two snakes are in this field, and both, female and male, are powerless.
