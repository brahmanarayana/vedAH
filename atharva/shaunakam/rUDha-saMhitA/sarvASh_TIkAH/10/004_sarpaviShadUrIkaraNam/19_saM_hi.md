### Translation
19. Since I have grasped together their heads, as a fisherman the  
*kárvara;* having gone away to the middle of the river, I have washed  
out the snake's poison.

### Notes
The mss. do not in general distinguish *ṣṭ* and *ṣṭh*, and *pāuñjiṣṭa*  
would be equally correct here. Ppp. reads *pāuñjiṣṭhī ’va*.

Their heads have I seized firmly as a fisher grasps the spotted prey, Waded half through the stream and washed the poison of the serpents off.
