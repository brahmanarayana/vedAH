### Translation
1. Indra's \[was\] the first chariot, the gods' the after chariot,  
Varuna's the third one; the snakes' chariot, the furthest one (?), hath  
run against the pillar: then may it come to harm (?).

### Notes
There are very questionable points here; the translation of **d**  
implies emendation of *apamā́* (p. *apa॰mā́*) to *apamás;* yet *apa-mā́*  
might perhaps be understood adverbially (like *upamā́*, p. *upa॰mā́:*  
twice in RV.). Ppp. reads *upamā* here. The translation of the last  
clause implies the reading *áthā riṣat*, which is given by several mss.  
(P.M.I.K.) and by Ppp., and which the meter favors; but such variants as  
arisat for arsat are found elsewhere, and the ms. authority is decidedly  
in favor of *arṣat*, as the *pada*-texts read (but Kp. *ardvyat*, by a  
curious blunder)—if only we knew what to make of it. No indicative form  
not an aorist can be coördinated with *ārat*.
