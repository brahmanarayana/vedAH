### Translation
16. Indra hath put the snake in my power, \[also\] both Mitra and  
Varuṇa, and Vāta ('wind') and Parjanya, both of them.

### Notes
The name given by the Anukr. to the verse is of uncertain value; it is  
possible to read the last pāda either as 8 or as 6 syllables. Ppp. reads  
in **a** *me ‘hīn ajambhayat*. Many of our mss. (P.I.O.R.T.K.) ⌊and the  
majority of SPP's⌋ read in **c** *-janyò ’bhā́*, but it is contrary to  
all rule and analogy; ⌊and W's Bp. and SPP's *pada*-text give -*janyā̀  
ubhā́*⌋.
