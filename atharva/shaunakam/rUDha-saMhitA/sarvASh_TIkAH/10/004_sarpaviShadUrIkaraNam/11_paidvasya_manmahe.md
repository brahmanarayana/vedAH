### Translation
11. We reverence Pāidva, the staunch one, of staunch abode (-*dhā́man*);  
here behind sit *pṛ́dākus*, plotting forth.

### Notes
Ppp. combines at the end *-dhyatā ”sate*. The Anukr. treats **b** as  
regular, thus sanctioning the resolution *-dhā-ma-naḥ*.

We fix our thoughts on Pedu's horse, strong, off-spring of a stedfast line. Behind our backs the vipers here crouch down and lie in wait for us.
