### Translation
25. Remove thou \[it\] from every limb; make \[it\] avoid the heart;  
then, what keenness (*téjas*) the poison has, let that go downward for  
thee.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *hṛdayo* in **b**, and combines *tejo av-* in **c, d**. The  
verse is quoted in Kāuś. 32. 23.

From every member drive away the venom, and avoid the heart. Then let the poison's burning heat pass downward and away- from thee.
