### Translation
17. Indra hath put the snake in my power, the *pṛ́dāku* and the  
she-*pṛ́dāku*, the constrictor, the cross-lined one, the *kasarṇī́la*, the  
*dáśonasi*.

### Notes
The accent *pṛdākvám* (instead of *-kvàm*) is read by all the mss., and  
hence by our text; but it is incontestably wrong. The Anukr. takes no  
notice of the lacking syllable in **c**. Ppp. reads ⌊for **a**⌋ *pāidvo  
me ‘hīn ajambhayat*, and ⌊for **d**⌋ *kuśirṇīlaṁ naśonaśīṁ*.
