### Translation
4. The *araṁghuṣá*, having immerged, having emerged, said again: like  
water-floated wood, sapless is the snake's poison, fierce water.

### Notes
The *pada*-text divides *aram॰ghuṣáḥ* in **a**, and the Pet. Lexx.  
conjecture the meaning accordingly to be 'loud-sounding.' ⌊Pischel  
discusses the vs., *Ved. Stud.*, ii. 74.⌋ Ppp. is corrupt at the  
beginning, but seems to read *udan̄ghojyonmajya punar* etc.; ⌊again it  
ends with *vār id ugram*⌋.

Loud neighing he hath dived below, and rising up again replied, Stayed the dire poison of the Snakes, and made it weak as soaking wood.
