### Translation
23. All trembled at the embryo, while being born, of her who gives not  
birth (? *asūsū́*); for "the cow hath given birth," they say of her;  
shaped (m.) by charms (*bráhman*); for it is her connection.

### Notes
Much here is obscure and doubtful. *Asūsū́* (not divided in p.) ought, by  
its accent, to be *asū-sū* 'giving birth to one who does not herself  
give birth' ⌊*Gram.* § 1147 c⌋. The connection of *kḷptás* with *vaśā́*  
is strange; the former belongs probably to *gárbhas* understood. The  
accent of *āhús* indicates that *hí* belongs with it, and not with  
*sasū́va*. The name *vaśā́* used for the cow throughout the hymn implies  
non-pregnancy. Ppp. reads at the end *brahmaṇā kḷpta* ⌊R's Collation  
spells it *klipta*⌋ *uta bandhur asyāt*. ⌊The verse may be counted as 36  
syllables; but the nearest approach to a natural scansion would seem to  
be 8 + 8: 11 (*taām*) + 11.⌋ ⌊I will not attempt to revise W's treatment  
of this verse. Griffith and the other translators may be consulted.⌋

All trembled at the babe that came from him who brings not to the birth. He hath produced her--thus they cried--He is a cow, and formed by spells, he hath become skin to her.
