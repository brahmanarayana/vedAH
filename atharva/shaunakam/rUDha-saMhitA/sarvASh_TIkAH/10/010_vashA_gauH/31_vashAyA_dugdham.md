### Translation
31. Having drunk the yield of the cow, the Perfectibles and they who  
are Vasus—they verily worship the milk (*páyas*) of her at the summit of  
the ruddy one.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *ime* instead of *te vāi* at beginning of **c**. The  
definition of the meter by the Anukr. is bad, the verse being, by usual  
and easy resolutions, a regular *anuṣṭubh*.

When these, Sadhyas and Vasus, have drunk the out-pourings of the Cow, They in the Bright One's dwelling-place pay adoration to her milk.
