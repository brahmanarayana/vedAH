### Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xvi. ⌊with the verse-sequence 15 a, b, 14 c, d, 13, 14 a, b, 15 c, d, 17, 16, 18; vs. 3 is lacking⌋. Not noticed in Vāit., and only once in Kāuś., at 66. 20, where vs. 1 (or the hymn ⌊rather the hymn⌋) is used, with xii. 4, to accompany the sprinkling of an offered cow.
