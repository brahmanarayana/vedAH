### Translation
32. Some milk her for soma; some worship ghee; they who gave the cow to  
the one knowing thus are gone to the triple heaven of the heaven.

### Notes
The *pada*-mss., by an absurd blunder, read *yā́* before *evám* into  
*yáḥ* instead of *yé*. It is apparently the intrusion of *vaśā́m* into  
**c** that makes the meter irregular. ⌊Pādas **a, b** are a reminiscence  
of RV. x. 154. 1 (= AV. xviii. 2. 14).⌋

For Soma some have milked her: some worship the fatness she hath poured. They who have given a cow to him who hath this knowledge have gone up to the third region of the sky.
