### Translation
9. When, called by the Ādityas, thou didst approach, O righteous one,  
Indra made thee drink a thousand vessels (*pā́tra*) of soma, O cow.

### Notes
By a notable inconsistency, the Anukr. reckons this verse as a complete  
*anuṣṭubh*, although it requires, to make it such, precisely the same  
resolution (*pā́-tṛ-ān*) as vs. 8.

When, Holy One, thou camest nigh invited by the Adityas' call, Indra gave thee to drink, O cow, a thousand bowls of Soma juice.
