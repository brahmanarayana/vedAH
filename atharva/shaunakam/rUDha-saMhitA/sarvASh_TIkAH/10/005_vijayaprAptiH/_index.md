### Comment
⌊The hymn is mingled prose and verse: 22-24, 42-43, 45-50, and parts of 7-14 and 36-41 are metrical. Cf. Whitney, Index, p. 5.⌋ This hymn, which by the mss. is given and numbered as one,* without any intimation of a subdivision, is by the Anukr. divided into four† parts, which are even ascribed to different authors. ⌊Part A = verses 1-24; B = 25-35; C = 37-41; D = 42-50.⌋ Verses 1-41, or the first three divisions, are found also in Pāipp. xvi.; part of the last division (vss. 45, 42 c, d, 43, 44, in this order), in Pāipp. i.—⌊"Water-thunderbolts" appears to me to be nothing more than a highfalutin name, well befitting the black magic of this hymn, for handfuls of water hurled with much hocus-pocus.⌋


*⌊Bp. does indeed begin anew at vs. 41 (not vs. 42!) to number the verses as 1 etc.⌋


†⌊Just where vs. 36 belongs—if it does not form a division by itself—is not clear; it goes well as an ending to the group of vss. 25-35 and is cited with them (Keśava, p. 35231: iti dvādaśabhiḥ). On the other hand, the Anukr. expressly defines division B as ekādaśa; and the corrupt mārtvī or mārtvi of the Anukr. seems to contain an ascription of authorship for vs. 36. Dr. Ryder suggests that Mārīca may be intended (cf. vii. 62, 63; x. 10). See my arrangement of the Anukr. extracts just before vs. 25.⌋
