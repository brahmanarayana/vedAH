### Translation
47. Unite me, O Agni, with splendor, with progeny, with life-time; may  
the gods know me as such; may Indra know, together with the seers.

### Notes
These two verses we had above, as vii. 89. 1, 2. Neither they nor the  
two that follow are found in Ppp. here.

Give me the boon of splendid strength; give, Agni! progeny and life. May the Gods know this prayer of mine, may Indra with the Rishis know.
