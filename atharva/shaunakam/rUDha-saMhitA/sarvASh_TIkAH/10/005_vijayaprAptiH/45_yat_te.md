### Translation
45. What food of thine, O Lord of earth (*bhū́*), dwells upon the earth  
(*pṛthivī́*)—of that, O lord of earth, do thou furnish unto us, O  
Prajāpati.

### Notes
The Anukr. implies the contraction of *ṣiyati* in **b** to *kṣyati* (cf.  
above, 2. 22, 23). Ppp. ⌊in i.⌋ puts this verse before our vs. 42.
