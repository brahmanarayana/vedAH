### Translation
38. I turn toward the quarters full of light; let them yield me  
property, let them etc. etc.

### Notes
The metrical description of the Anukr. does not fit the verse (11: 8 +  
8) quite accurately. The resolution *abhi-ā́v-* is implied in all these  
verses.

I turn me to the regions bright with splendour. May they bestow upon me wealth and glory of a Brahman's rank.
