### Translation
1. Indra's force are ye; Indra's power are ye; Indra's strength are ye;  
Indra's heroism are ye; Indra's manliness are ye; unto a conquering  
junction (*yóga*) with *brahman*-junctions I join you.

### Notes
The *pada*-text marks a pāda-division after each *stha;* but the Anukr.  
lumps all ⌊up to the avasāna-mark⌋ together as an *abhikṛti*-pāda (25  
syll.), and reckons the whole verse (25: 6 + 8 = 39) mechanically as 2l  
*pan̄kti*, because it contains nearly 40 syllables. Ppp. has in  
succession *balam, nṛmṇam, śuklam, vīryam*, and in **c**, *indrayogāis*.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
⌊Render: 'for a use conducive to victory, with uses of incantation  
\[*or* with masterly uses\] \[*or* with Brahman uses\] I use you.' In  
*brahma-* I am inclined to see a triple *śleṣa*, the second sense being  
like that in the title *Brahma-jāla-sutta* (of the *Dīghanikāya*), 'the  
boss-net, the master-net.' In the first and second senses, *brahma-* is  
pertinent: not so in the sense of Brahman, in which last, however, it  
serves well enough for a point of departure for *kṣatram*, considering  
what black magic this is.⌋
