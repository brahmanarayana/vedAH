### Translation
37. I turn after the sun's turn (*āvṛ́t*), after his turn to the right;  
let it yield (*yam*) me property; \[let\] it \[yield\] me  
Brahman-splendor.

### Notes
The verse is quoted in Kāuś. 6. 15, in a *parvan* ceremony, accompanying  
a turn to the right (vss. 25-35 were quoted in the next preceding rule).  
⌊Cf. also MB. i. 6. 19, where the comm. cites also GGS. ii. 10. 27.⌋

I follow Surya's course in heaven, the course that takes him to the South. May that bestow upon me wealth and glory of a Brahman's rank.
