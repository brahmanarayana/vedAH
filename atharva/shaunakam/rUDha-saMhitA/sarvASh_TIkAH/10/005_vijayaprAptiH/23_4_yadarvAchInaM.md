### Translation
23. I send you forth to the ocean; go ye unto your own lair; uninjured,  
of completed years (?); and let nothing whatever ail (*am*) us.

### Notes
The third pāda apparently belongs to 'us,' though out of construction.  
⌊As to *-hāyas*, of. viii. 2. 7, note, and Bergaigne, *Rel. Véd.*, iii.  
287.⌋ The last pāda occurred above, as vi. 57. 3 **b**. The first two  
pādas, with the first word of the third, are found also in several  
sūtras: śśS. iv. 11. 6; LśS. ii. i. 7; PGS. i. 3. 14; AśS. iii. 11. 6;  
Āp. xiii. 18. 1; iv. 14. 4; the first three read in **b** *abhi  
gacchata*, the others *api gacchata* (and Āp. iv. 14. 4 has *acchidraḥ*  
instead of *ariṣṭāḥ*); the end of the verse is entirely different from  
ours, and more or less discordant in the various works. ⌊See also MGS.  
ii. 11. 18 and the Index, p. 157.⌋ Kāuś. quotes the verse at 6. 17, in a  
*parvan* ceremony; and with vs. 24, at 136. 6. Ppp. reads in **a** *vo  
’pasṛjāmi* ⌊and inverts the order of vss. 23 and 24⌋.
