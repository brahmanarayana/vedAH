### Translation
50. I, knowing, hurl at this man, to split his head, the four-pointed  
(*-bhṛṣṭí*) thunderbolt of the waters; let it crush all his limbs: to  
this on my part let all the gods assent.

### Notes
The Anukr., strictly understood, implies the resolution *va-jṛ-am* in  
**a**. For the quotations of the verse, with other verses of the hymn,  
by Kāuś., see above ⌊introduction⌋.  
  
⌊The hymn exceeds the norm by 20 verses and the quoted Anukr. says  
*viṅśatiḥ*.⌋  
  
⌊Here ends the twenty-second *prapāṭhaka*.⌋

Well-skilled, against this man I hurl the Water's bolt with four spikes, to cleave his head asunder. May it destroy all members of his body. Let the whole host of Gods approve my purpose.
