### Translation
6. Indra's force etc. etc.; unto a conquering junction; let all  
existences wait upon (*upa-sthā*) me; joined to me are ye, O waters.

### Notes
The Anukr. quotes this verse by the first words that are peculiar to it,  
viz. *viśvānī mā*, but its description applies to the whole (25: 6 + 11  
+ 6 = 48); probably *jagatī-garbhā* is an oversight for *triṣṭubgarbhā*.  
The Kāuś. quotes the common *pratīka* of the six verses at 49. 3, in a  
witchcraft-ceremony; and their common second part (*jiṣṇave yogāya*) at  
49. 4, to accompany the 'joining of waters' (*ity apo yunakti*).  
According to the editor of Kāuś., vss. 6 and 7 are quoted also in 49.  
24, 25; but it does not appear why the 'sixth' and 'seventh' verses of  
this hymn should be intended. ⌊Caland, p. 173, in fact understands xiii.  
3. 6, 7 as intended.⌋ According to the comm. to Kāuś. 47. 31, these  
verses, with vss. 15-21, 42, 50, accompany the hurling of  
'water-thunderbolts' (*udavajra:* cf. vs. 50 below), whatever those may  
be; it is perhaps their preparation that is the subject of these verses;  
in Kāuś. 49. 13, only vss. 15-21, 42, 50 are quoted together, in  
connection with the same ⌊cf. the introduction⌋.  
  
⌊See above, p. lxxvi.⌋
