### Translation
42. Whom we hunt, him will we lay low with deadly weapons; by our spell  
(*bráhman*) have we made him fall (*pad*) into the opened mouth of the  
most exalted one.

### Notes
Only the latter half-verse is found in Ppp. ⌊namely, in i.⌋. The  
*pada*-text in **d** reads *bráhmaṇā: ā́: apīp-*. The quotation of the  
verse, with vss. 15-21, 50, in Kāuś. was noted above, ⌊see introd.⌋.

We hunt that man, we beat him down and slay him with our murderous blows. We with the spell have hurried him to Parameshthin's opened jaws.
