### Translation
44. King Varuṇa's bond art thou; do thou bind so-and-so, of  
such-and-such lineage, son of such-and-such mother, in food, in breath.

### Notes
There is apparently something wrong, perhaps an omission, in the text of  
the Anukr. at this point; it reads *tripād gāyatragarbhā st anuṣṭubh*,  
and then passes to vs. 50, taking no notice of vss. 48, 49 (which are  
redundant *triṣṭubhs:* but see the note to vs. 49), ⌊nor of vs. 47⌋. Our  
present verse (prose) reads most naturally as 10: 12 + 7 = 29 syllables.

Thou art the bound of Varuna the King. Bind, such an one, the son of such a woman, in vital breath and in the food that feeds him.
