### Translation
14. As both wind and fire devour (*psā*) the trees, the forest-trees, so  
do thou devour my rivals, those born etc. etc.

### Notes
Ppp. again relieves the redundancy of expression by reading *sarvān*  
instead of *vṛkṣān* in **b**; also it has in **c** *-tnāṅs tvam* for  
*-tnān me*.

As Agni and the wind devour the trees, the sovrans of the wood, Even so devour my rivals, born before me and born after. Let the Varana protect thee well.
