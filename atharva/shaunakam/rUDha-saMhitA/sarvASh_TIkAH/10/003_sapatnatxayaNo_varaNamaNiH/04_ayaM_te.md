### Translation
4. This *varaṇá* \[shall ward off\] the witchcraft extended for thee;  
this shall shield thee against fear arising from men, this against all  
evil.

### Notes
Ppp. preserves unity of construction through the verse, by reading, for  
**b, c**: *pāuruṣeyam ayaṁ vadham: ayaṁ te sarvaṁ pāpmānaṁ*.
