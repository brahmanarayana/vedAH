### Translation
3. This amulet, the *varaṇá*, all-healing, thousand-eyed, yellow,  
golden—it shall make thy foes go downward; do thou, in front, damage  
them that hate thee.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *hiraṇmayaḥ* at end of **b**, and *yas* for *sa* at beginning  
of **c**. The verse is rather *svarāj* than *bhurij*.
