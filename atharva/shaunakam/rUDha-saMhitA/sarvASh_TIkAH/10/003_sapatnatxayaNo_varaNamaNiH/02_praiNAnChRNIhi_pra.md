### Translation
2. Crush them, slaughter, take hold; be the amulet thy forerunner in  
front; the gods by the *varaṇá* warded off the hostile practice  
(*abhyācārá*) of the Asuras from one morrow to another.

### Notes
The comm. to Prāt. iii. 80 quotes the beginning of the verse as example  
of *eṇa* after *pra*. It is unnecessary to view, with the Anukr., the  
verse as redundant. Ppp. combines *te ‘stu* in **b**.

Break them in pieces; grasp them and destroy them. This Amu- let shall go before and lead thee. With Varana the Gods, from morn to morning, have warded off the Asuras' enchantment.
