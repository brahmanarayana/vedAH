### Translation
17. As the sun shines exceedingly, as in it brilliancy is set, so let  
the *varaṇá* amulet fix (*ni-yam*) in me fame \[and\] growth; let it  
sprinkle me with brilliancy; let it anoint me with glory.

### Notes
Part of the mss. (P.M.D.) accent *asmín* in **b**. Ppp. reads, for **c**  
etc., *evā sapatnāṅs tvaṁ sarvān ati bhāhi syaśvo varuṇas tvā ’bhi  
rakṣatu*. ⌊Either Mr. Whitney took *me* as locative (*Gram.* §492 a); or  
else his 'in me' is an inadvertence for 'for me.'⌋

As Surya shines with brightest sheen, as splendour hath been stored in him, So may the Charm, the Varana, give me prosperity and fame. With lustre let it sprinkle me, and balm me with magni- ficence.
