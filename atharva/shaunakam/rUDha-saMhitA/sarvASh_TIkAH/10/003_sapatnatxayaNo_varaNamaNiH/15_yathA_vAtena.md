### Translation
15. As, destroyed by the wind, the trees lie prostrate (*nyàrpita*), so  
do thou destroy, prostrate my rivals, those born etc. etc.

### Notes
Ppp. is quite corrupt in this verse, but does not appear to offer any  
variant. *Prá kṣiṇīhi* properly ought to be divided in our text.

As, shattered by the tempest, trees lie withering ruined on the ground. Thus over throw my rivals thou, so crush them down and ruin. them, those born before and after. Let this Varana protect thee well.
