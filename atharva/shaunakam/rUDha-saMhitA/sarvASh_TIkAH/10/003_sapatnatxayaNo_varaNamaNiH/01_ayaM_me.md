### Translation
1. This *varaṇá* \[is\] my rival-destroying, virile (*vṛ́ṣan*) amulet;  
with it do thou take hold of thy foes, slaughter thy injurers  
(*durasy-*).

### Notes
The *varaṇa* is a tree, the *Cratœva Roxburghii* found throughout India.  
The name comes doubtless from the root *vṛ* 'cover, protect, ward off';  
and the hymn is full of allusions to a connection with that root; ⌊cf.  
the play in iv. 7. 1 and vi. 85. 1⌋. Ppp. reads throughout *varuṇa*,  
which is also in later Skt. recognized as a form of the tree-name.
