### Translation
11. This *varaṇá* on my breast, king, divine forest-tree—let it drive  
(*bādh*) away my foes, as Indra the barbarians, the Asuras.

### Notes
The verse is quoted in the schol. to Kāuś. 10. 2. Ppp. combines *varuṇo  
’rasi*, as the meter requires, but as the Anukr. takes pains not to  
authorize. Ppp. also exchanges the second halves of vss. 11 and 12.

This Varana is on my breast, the sovran, the celestial Plant. Let it afflict my foemen as Indra quelled fiends and Asuras.
