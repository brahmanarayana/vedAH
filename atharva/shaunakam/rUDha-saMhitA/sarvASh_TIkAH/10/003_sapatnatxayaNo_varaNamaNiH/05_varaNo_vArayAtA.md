### Translation
5. The *varaṇá*, this divine forest-tree, shall ward off; the *yákṣma*  
that has entered into this man—that have the gods warded off.

### Notes
We had this verse above, as vi. 85. 1. The Anukr. takes no notice in  
either place of the deficient syllable in **a**. Ppp. reads here, for  
**b**, *idaṁ devo bṛhaspatiḥ;* and, for **c**, *yakṣmā pratiṣṭhā yo  
‘smin;* ⌊and then *tam u* etc.⌋.
