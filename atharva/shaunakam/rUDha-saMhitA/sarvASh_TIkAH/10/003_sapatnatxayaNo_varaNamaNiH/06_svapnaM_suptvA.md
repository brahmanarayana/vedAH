### Translation
6. If, having slept, thou shalt see an evil dream; if a wild beast  
(*mṛgá*) shall run a disagreeable course—from overmuch (? pari-)  
sneezing, from the evil utterance of a bird (*śakúni*), this amulet, the  
*varaṇá*, shall shield thee.

### Notes
The translation implies in **b** emendation of *yáti* to *yádi*, which  
seems unavoidable. Ppp., however, appears to have *yati;* it reads  
further in **b** *mṛgaśrutaṁ* and *ajuṣṭaṁ*, in **c** *paricchavā*, ⌊and  
in **d** *vārayātāi*⌋. The verse is included in the *duḥsvapnanāśana  
gaṇa:* see note to Kāuś. 46. 9.

If in thy sleep thou see an evil vision, oft as the beast repeats his loathed approaches, This Amulet, this Varana will guard thee from sneeze, and from the bird's ill-omened message.
