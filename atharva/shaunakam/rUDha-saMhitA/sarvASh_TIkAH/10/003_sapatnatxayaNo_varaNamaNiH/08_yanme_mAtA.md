### Translation
8. What sin my mother, what my father, and what my own brothers, what we  
ourselves have done, from that shall this divine forest-tree shield us.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *tasmāt* for *tatas* in **d**, and, for **e**, *idaṁ deva  
bṛhaspatiḥ:* compare its version of 5 **b**.

Each sinful act that we have done,--my mother, father, and my friends,-- From all the guilt this heavenly Plant will be our guard and sure defence.
