### Translation
32. Him that is near by he (?) deserts not; him that is near by he (?)  
sees not; see the wisdom (*kā́vya*) of the god: he died not, he grows not  
old.

### Notes
There is nothing to determine the subject of the verbs in **a, b**;  
Ludwig renders 'she.'

When he is near she leaves him not, she sees him not though he is near. Behold the wisdom of the God; he hath not died, he grows not old.
