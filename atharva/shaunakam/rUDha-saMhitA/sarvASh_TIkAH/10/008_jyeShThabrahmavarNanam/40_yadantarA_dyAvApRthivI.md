### Translation
40. Mātariśvan was entered into the waters; the gods were entered into  
the seas; great stood the traverser of space; the purifying one entered  
into the green ones.

### Notes
The third pāda is identical with 3 **c** above, and the fourth with RV.  
viii. 90 (101). 14 **d**. 'The purifying one' is probably here the wind.

Into the floods had Matarisvan entered, the deities had past in- to the waters. There stood the mighty measurer of the region: into the ver- dant plants went Pavamana.
