### Translation
29. The full from the full he bends up (*ud-ac*); the full is poured  
with the full; also that may we know today, whence that is poured out.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
This verse is akin with ⌊the oft-repeated⌋ one in śB. xiv. 8. 1 (BAU. v.  
1): *pūrṇám adáḥ pūrṇám idám pūrṇā́t pūrṇám úd acyate* etc. What follows  
of the hymn is (as noted above) wanting in Ppp.

Forth from the full he lifts the full, the full he sprinkles with the full. Now also may we know the source from which the stream is sprinkled round.
