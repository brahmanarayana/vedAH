### Translation
15. In the distance it dwells with the full one, in the distance it is  
abandoned by the deficient one—the great monster (*yakṣá*) in the midst  
of existence; to it the kingdom-bearers bear tribute.

### Notes
The verse, as noted above, is wanting in Ppp. ⌊Pāda **c** occurs as x.  
7. 38 **a**: see note thereon and introd. to hymn 7.⌋

With the full vase he dwells afar, is left far off what time it fails, A mighty Being in creation's centre: to him the rulers of the realms bring tribute.
