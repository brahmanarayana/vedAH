### Translation
11. What stirs, flies, and what stands, and what is breathing, not  
breathing, winking—that, all-formed, sustains the earth; that,  
combining, becomes one only.

### Notes
One may conjecture *apānát* for *áprāṇat* in **b**. The Anukr. does not  
heed that two of the pādas are *triṣṭubh*. Ppp. reads at end of **b**  
*ca tiṣṭhat*, and, in **c**, *dyām utā ’muṁ* ⌊at 7. 35 it was fem.⌋ for  
*viśvarūpam*.

That which hath power of motion, that which flies, or stands, which breathes or breathes not, which, existing, shuts the eye Wearing all forms that entity upholds the earth, and in its close consistence still is only one.
