### Translation
22. Enjoyable shall he become, likewise shall he eat much food, who  
shall worship (*upa-ās*) the everlasting god who gives superiority  
(*uttarā́vant*).

### Notes
⌊After *bhógyo bhavat*, for which there are no variants, Bp. has a mark  
of pāda-division; but the Anukr. evidently scans as 12: 8 + 8, eliding  
the *a* of *ánnam* after a *pragṛhya*.⌋ *Bhā́gyo* at the beginning is a  
misprint for *bhógyo*.
