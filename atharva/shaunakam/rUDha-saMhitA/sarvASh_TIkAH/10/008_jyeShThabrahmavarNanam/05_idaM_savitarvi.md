### Translation
5. This, O Savitar, do thou distinguish: six \[are\] twins, one \[is\]  
sole-born; they seek participation (*apitvá*) in him who of them is the  
sole sole-born.

### Notes
The usual twelve months, two to a season, and the thirteenth occasional  
intercalary one, are doubtless meant. Ppp. reads in **b** *yomokas* (for  
*yamā ekas*). ⌊The *pada*-mss. of both W. and SPP. have *api॰tvám;* but  
in the *Index* W. assumes that *āpitvám* is the word. Both are well  
authenticated in BR.; but *apitvám* seems to fit best here (cf. śB. iv.  
i. 3¹¹).⌋

Discern thou this, O Savitar. Six are the twins, one singly born. They claim relationship in that among them which is born alone.
