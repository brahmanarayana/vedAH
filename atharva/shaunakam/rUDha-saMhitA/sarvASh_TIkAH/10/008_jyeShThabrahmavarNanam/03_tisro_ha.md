### Translation
3. Three offspring (*prajā́*) went an over-going; others settled  
(*ni-viś*) about the sun (? *arká*); great stood the traverser  
(*vimā́na*) of space (*rájas*); the yellow one (m.) entered into the  
yellow ones (f.).

### Notes
The verse is RV. viii. 90 (101). 14, which reads, for **a**, *prajā́ ha  
tisró atyā́yam īyur;* at end of **b**, *viviśre;* for **c, d**, *bṛhád  
dha tasthāu bhúvaneṣv antáḥ pávamāno haríta ā́ viveśa* (the last pāda is  
our 40 **d** below). AA. (ii. 1. 1⁴) has the same version as RV. JB.  
(ii. 224) has a version agreeing in the main with RV., but beginning  
like ours, *tisro ha prajā*, ending **b** with *viviśyur*, beginning  
**c** with *bṛhan* (but *bṛhad* in a following brief exposition); in  
**c**, again, with our text, *rajaso vimānāi ’va* (in the exposition  
simply *vimāne*); in **d** as RV. The Anukr. takes no notice of the  
defective fourth pāda. Ppp. reads *na* (for *ha*) and *vimānaṁ* in  
**c**, and combines *prajā ’ty-*, and *anyā ’rkam*.

Three generations have gone by and vanished and others near have entered into sunlight. There stood on high he who metes out the region into green, plants hath passed the Golden-coloured.
