### Translation
7. One-wheeled it rolls, one-rimmed, thousand-syllabled, forth in  
front, down behind; with a half it has generated all existence; what its  
\[other\] half is—what has become of that?

### Notes
This agrees nearly with xi. 4. 22 below, and Ppp. has it there, though  
not here. The sun is evidently meant, with half his course lost to view.
