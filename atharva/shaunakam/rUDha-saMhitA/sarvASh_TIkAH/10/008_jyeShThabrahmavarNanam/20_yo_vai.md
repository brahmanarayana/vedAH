### Translation
20. Whoever indeed knows those two churning-sticks, with which is  
churned out what is good (*vásu*), he may think himself to know the  
chief thing; he may know the great *bráhmaṇa* ⌊neut.⌋.

The sage who knows the kindling-sticks whence by attrition wealth is drawn, Will comprehend what is most high, will know the mighty Brahmana.
