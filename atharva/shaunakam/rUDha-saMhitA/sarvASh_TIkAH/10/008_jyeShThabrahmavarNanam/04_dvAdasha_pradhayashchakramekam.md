### Translation
4. Twelve fellies, one wheel, three naves—who understands that? therein  
are inserted (*ā́hata*) three hundred and sixty pins (*śan̄kú*), pegs (?  
*khī́la*) that are immovable.

### Notes
The verse is also RV. i. 164. 48, which, however, has a very different  
second half: *tásmin sākáṁ triśatā́ ná śan̄kávo ‘rpitā́ḥ ṣaṣṭír ná  
calācalā́saḥ*. The 'pins' or 'pegs' must be the equivalents of spokes.  
The three naves are probably seasons ⌊Hot, Wet, and Cold: cf. Bühler,  
*Epigraphia Indica*, ii. 262⌋, though the number is unusual. Ppp. reads  
*kelās* for *khīlās* in **d**. The Anukr. does not heed that **c** is a  
*jagatī* pāda. ⌊Kaṭha-reading *nā́bhyāni*, WZKM. xii. 282.⌋
