### Translation
41. Higher, as it were, than the *gāyatrī́*, upon the immortal (*amṛ́ta*)  
he strode out; they who know completely chant with chant—where then was  
seen the goat?

### Notes
Or, 'the unborn one' (*ajá:* so Ludwig); the verse is too utterly  
obscure to let us choose between them.

Over the Gayatri, above the immortal world he strode away. Those who by Song discovered Song--where did the Unborn see that thing?
