### Translation
43. The lotus-flower of nine doors, covered with three strands (*guṇá*)  
— what soulful prodigy (*yakṣá*) is within it, that the  
*bráhman*-knowers know.

### Notes
The 'nine doors' indicate that the human body with its nine orifices is  
intended; the three *guṇas* are probably the three temperaments familiar  
under that name later. The second half-verse was found above as 2. 32  
**c, d** ⌊cf. vs. 31⌋.  
  
⌊☞ See p. 1045.⌋
