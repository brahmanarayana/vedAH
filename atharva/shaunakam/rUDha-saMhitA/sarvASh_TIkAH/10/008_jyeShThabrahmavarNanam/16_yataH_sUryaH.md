### Translation
16. Whence the sun arises, and where he goes to rest—that same I think  
the chief (*jyeṣṭhá*); that nothing whatever surpasses.

### Notes
The Kaṭha Up. ⌊iv. 9⌋ has a nearly corresponding verse: *yataś co ’d eti  
sūryo “staṁ yatra ca gacchati: taṁ devāḥ sarve ‘rpitās tad u nā ’ty eti  
kaś cana;* and the first half of this occurs also in śB. xiv. 4. 3³⁴  
(BAU. i. 5. 23). The Anukr. omits to define the meter (*anuṣṭubh*) of  
the verse.

That, whence the Sun arises, that whither he goes to take his rest, That verily I hold supreme: naught in the world surpasses it.
