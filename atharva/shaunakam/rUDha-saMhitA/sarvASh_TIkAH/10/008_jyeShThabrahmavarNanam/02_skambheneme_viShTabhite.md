### Translation
2. By the *skambhá* these two stand fixed apart, both sky and earth; in  
the *skambhá* \[is\] all this that has soul, what \[is\] breathing and  
what winking.

### Notes
The Anukr. is scrupulous enough not to sanction the irregular  
combination *skambhé ’dám* in **c**; why it calls the verse  
*bṛhatīgarbhā*, instead of simply *bhurij* (like vs. 5), it were hard to  
say.

Upheld by Skambha's power these two, the heaven and the earth, stand fast. Skambha is all this world of life, whatever breathes or shuts an. eye.
