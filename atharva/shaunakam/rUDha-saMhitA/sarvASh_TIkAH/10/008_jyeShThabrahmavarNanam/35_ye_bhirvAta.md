### Translation
35. They by whom the wind sent forth blows on, who give the five  
quarters together (*sadhryàñc*), the gods who thought themselves above  
(*ati-man*) the offering (*ā́huti*), conductors of the waters—which were  
they?

### Notes
The first half-verse is found also in Ppp. ⌊xvi.⌋, but not in connection  
with the rest of the hymn. The Anukr. does not heed that **a** is  
defective by one syllable. Read in **b**, with all ⌊W's and SPP's⌋ mss.,  
*dádante;* the form is from the same secondary root *dad* as the sing.  
*dadate* in 36 **c**. ⌊JUB. (i. 34) has this verse, putting it in the  
mouth of Pṛthu Vāinya, and its answer (vs. 36), with appended  
Brāhmaṇa-comment. It reads *samīcīḥ* for *sadhrīcīḥ* of our 35 **b**,  
and *āhutīs* in **c**.⌋

Who gave command unto the wind that blowet! Who ranged the five united heavenly regions? Who were the Gods who cared not for oblations! Which of them brought the sacrificial waters?
