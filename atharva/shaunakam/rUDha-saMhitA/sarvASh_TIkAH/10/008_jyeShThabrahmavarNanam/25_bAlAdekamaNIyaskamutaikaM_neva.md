### Translation
25. One thing is more minute (*áṇu*) than a child (*bā́la*), also one is  
hardly (*né ’va*) seen; than that a more embracing deity, is she dear to  
me.

### Notes
Ppp. reads, for **a**, *ārāgramātraṁ dadṛśe*, and begins **c** with  
*ataṣ pa-*, thus doing nothing to help our comprehension of the wholly  
obscure verse.

One is yet finer than a hair, one is not even visible. And hence the Deity who grasps with firmer hold is dear to me.
