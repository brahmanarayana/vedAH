### Translation
28. Both their father, or also their son; both the chief or also the  
meanest (*kaniṣṭhá*) of them; the one god, who has entered into the  
mind, born the first, and he within the womb.

### Notes
The verse is also found, quoted as a *śloka*, in JUB. 85 (iii. 10. 12):  
*utāi ’ṣāṁ jāiṣṭha uta vā kaniṣṭha utāi ’ṣāṁ putra uta vā pitāi ’ṣāṁ:  
eko ha devo manasi praviṣṭaḥ pūrvo ha jajñe sa u garbhe ‘ntaḥ*. Ppp.  
reads, for **a, b**, *ute ’va jyeṣṭho ’ta vā kaniṣṭho ’tāi ’ṣa bhrāto  
’ta vā pitāi ’ṣaḥ;* and, in **d**, *pūrvo jātaḥ*.

Either the sire or son of these, the eldest or the youngest child. As sole God dwelling in the mind, first born, he still is in the womb.
