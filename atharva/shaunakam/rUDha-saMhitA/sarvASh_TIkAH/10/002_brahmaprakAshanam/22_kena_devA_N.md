### Translation
22. Wherewith does he dwell upon (? *anu-kṣi*) the gods? wherewith  
\[upon\] the people of the god-folk? wherewith this other asterism?  
whereby is authority (*kṣatrá*) called real (*sát*)?

### Notes
The sense here is very obscure, and the rendering mechanical. ⌊Griffith  
suggests that the point may lie in using *nakṣatram* as if it were *na  
kṣatram*, 'non-power,' in opposition to *kṣatram* in **d**.⌋ Ppp. has,  
for **b**, *kena devīr ajanayad diśaḥ*. The meter requires in **a**  
*kṣyati*, as the forms are written in some texts. The Anukr. takes no  
notice of the irregularity.

Through whom doth he abide with Gods? Through whom with the Celestial Tribes? Why is this other called a star? Why is this called the Real Power?
