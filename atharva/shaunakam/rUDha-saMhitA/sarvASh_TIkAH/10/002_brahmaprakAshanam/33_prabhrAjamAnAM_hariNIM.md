### Translation
33. The *bráhman* entered into the resplendent, yellow, golden,  
unconquered stronghold, that was all surrounded with glory.

### Notes
The verse is found also in TA. (i. 27. 3-4), which again reads  
*hiraṇmayīm*, and *brahmā́ vivéśa* ⌊so both ed's⌋ (the accent has no  
authority, as it is full of faults in this vicinity; but the comm.  
explains *brahmā́* as = *prajāpatiḥ:* which also does not go for much).  
⌊TA. has further *vi-* for *pra-* at the beginning and ends with *-jitā*  
(which the comm. explains as *-jitām*).⌋ Ppp. likewise has *hiraṇmayīm;*  
and further, in **d** *viveśā ca parājitaḥ*.  
  
⌊The quoted Anukr. says for this second hymn *tisraḥ* (i.e. 3 above the  
norm of 30).—Here ends the first *anuvaka*, with 2 hymns and 65 verses.⌋

Brahma hath passed within the fort, the golden castle; ne'er subdued, Bright with excessive brilliancy, compassed with glory round about.
