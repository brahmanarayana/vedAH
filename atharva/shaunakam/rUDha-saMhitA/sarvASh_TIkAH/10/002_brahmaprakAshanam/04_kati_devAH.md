### Translation
4. How many gods \[and\] which were they, who gathered (*ci*) the  
breast, the neck-bones of man? how many disposed the two teats? who the  
two collar-bones (? *kaphoḍá*)? how many gathered the shoulder-bones  
(pl.)? how many the ribs?

### Notes
Ppp. has again *pāuruṣasya* in **b**. In **c** it reads *ni dadhuṣ kaṣ  
kapolāu*. The mss. are extremely discordant as to the form of the word  
which our edition gives as *kaphāuḍāú;* that is the reading of Bp.W.D.;  
P.M.R.s.m. have *kapheḍāú*, I. *kaphāujhāú*, E.O.R.p.m.T.K. *kaphoḍāú*  
(which accordingly has the most authority in its favor ⌊all SPP's mss.  
read so⌋); several *saṁhitā*-mss. (P.M.T.O.p.m.R.s.m.) have *káṣ* before  
it. The meaning given is, of course, conjectural only; 'collar-bone' is  
Ludwig's guess, and seems to suit the connection (though that is a  
rather weak ground of preference) better than the '*perhaps* elbow' of  
the Pet. Lexx. The Anukr. takes no notice of the lacking syllable in  
**a**.
