### Translation
6. Who bored out the seven apertures in his head—these ears, the  
nostrils, the eyes, the mouth? in the might of whose conquest (*vijayá*)  
in many places quadrupeds \[and\] bipeds go their way.

### Notes
Bp. reads at the end *yā́man*. Ppp. puts *nāsike* after *cakṣaṇī*, and  
reads in **c** *vijāyasya mahamani*, and at the end *yomūn*. The Anukr.  
does not heed that **d** is a *triṣṭubh* pāda.

Who pierced the seven openings in the head? Who made these ears, these nostrils, eyes, and mouth, Through whose surpassing might in all directions bipeds and quadrupeds have power of motion?
