### Translation
27. Verily that head of Atharvan \[is\] a god-vessel, pressed together;  
breath defends that, the head, food, also mind.

### Notes
For *samubjīta*, as said of a *kośa*, compare ix. 3. 20 above. Ppp.  
reads *prāṇo ‘bhi* in **c**, and *śrīm* for *śiras* in **d**. The three  
nouns in **d** might be nom. instead of accus.

That is indeed Atharvan's head, the well-closed casket of the Gods. Spirit and Food and Vital Air protect that head from injury.
