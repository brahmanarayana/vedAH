### Translation
30. Him verily sight doth not desert, nor breath, before old age, who  
knoweth the *bráhman's* stronghold (*púr*), from which man (*púruṣa*) is  
\[so\] called.

### Notes
The latter half-verse is identical with 28 **c, d**. Ppp. reads *puraḥ*  
at end of **b**, and *yasmāt* in **d**.

Sight leaves him not, breath quits not him before life's natural decay, Who knows the fort of Brahma, yea, the fort whence Purusha is named.
