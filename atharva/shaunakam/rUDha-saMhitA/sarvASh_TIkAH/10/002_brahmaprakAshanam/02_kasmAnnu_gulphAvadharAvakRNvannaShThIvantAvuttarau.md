### Translation
2. From what, now, did they make a man's two ankle-joints below, his two  
knee-joints above? separating (? *nir-ṛ*) his two back-thighs  
(*ján̄ghā*), where, forsooth, did they set them in? the two joints of his  
knees—who indeed understands (*cit*) that?

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
*Nirṛ́tya* is a difficult and doubtful expression here. Ppp. reads  
*nirṛtijan̄ghe ni dadhuḥ;* also, in **d**, *saṁdhīm ū ca jānā*. In **b**  
it has again *pāuruṣasya*.

Whence did they make the ankles that are under, and the knee- bones of Purusha above them? What led them onward to the legs' construction? Who planned and formed the knees' articulations?
