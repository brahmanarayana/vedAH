### Translation
7. Since in his jaws he put his ample (*purūcī́*) tongue, then attached  
(*adhi-śri*) \[to it\] great voice; he rolls greatly on among  
existences, clothing himself in the waters: who indeed understands that?

### Notes
With **c** is to be compared ix. 10. 11 **d**; the irregularity of the  
pāda is not noticed by the Anukr. Ppp. reads instead of **c**: *sa ā  
varīvarti mahinā vyomaṁ: avasānaṣ kata cit pra veda*. Our text ought to  
read *varīvartti*.
