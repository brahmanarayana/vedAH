### Translation
10. Whence now in man \[come\] mishap, ruin, perdition, misery,  
accomplishment, success, non-failure? whence thought (*matí*), uprisings  
(*úditi*)?

### Notes
The minor Pet. Lex. suggests for *úditi* 'end, disappearance.' Ppp.  
reads in **b** *kuto ‘dhi pur-*. *Vyṛddhis* instead of *ávy-* would  
improve both sense and meter.
