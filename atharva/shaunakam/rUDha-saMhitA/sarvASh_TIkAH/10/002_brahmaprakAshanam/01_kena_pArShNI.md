### Translation
1. By whom were brought the two heels of a man (*púruṣa*)? by whom was  
his flesh put together? by whom his two ankle-joints (*gulphá*)? by whom  
his cunning (*péśana*) fingers? by whom his apertures? by whom his (two)  
*uchlakhás* in the midst? who \[put together\] his footing  
(*pratiṣṭhā́*)?

### Notes
The *pada*-text divides *ut॰ślakhāú*, as if there were such a word as  
*ślakha*. Ppp. reads, instead of *keno ’chlakhāu*, *keno ’cchinaṁ ko;*  
also, in **a**, *pārṣṇīy ābhṛte pāuruṣasya;* and, in **c**, *peśinīṣ*.  
*Péśana* is more literally 'arranging, adorning.'

Who framed the heels of Purusha? Who fashioned the flesh of him? Who formed and fixed his ankles? Who made the openings and well-moulded fingers? Who gave him foot-soles and a central station?
