### Translation
20. There are knives of good metal in our house; we know thy joints, O  
witchcraft, how many they are; just stand up; go away from here; unknown  
one, what seekest thou here?

### Notes
That is, 'thou who art no acquaintance of ours.' The Anukr. is much more  
scrupulous than usual in calling the verse (12 + 11: 8 + 8 = 39) *virāj*  
⌊scanning a perhaps as 11⌋. Ppp. begins with *svayasā*. The third pāda  
is quoted in Kāuś. 39. 19.

Within our house are swords of goodly iron. Kritya, we know thy joints and all their places. Arise this instant and begone! What, stranger! art thou seek- ing here?
