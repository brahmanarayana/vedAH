### Translation
3. śūdra-made, king-made, woman-made, made by Brahmans (*brahmán*), like  
a wife expelled (*nuttá*) by her husband, let her go to her maker, as  
connection.

### Notes
Either 'as her' or 'as his connection'; Ppp. decides for the former,  
reading *bandhum* ⌊for our bándhu⌋. ⌊W's alternative seems to be:  
*bándhum* must be in apposition with *kartā́ram;* but *bándhv* (p.  
*bándhu*) must be a neuter (as at v. 13. 7) and so in apposition with  
the subject-nominative, *kṛtyā́* understood.⌋

Made by a Sidra or a Prince, by priests or women let her go. Back to her maker as her kin, like a dame banished by her lord.
