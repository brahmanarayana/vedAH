### Translation
25. Anointed, smeared, well-adorned, bearing all difficulty, go thou  
away; recognize (*jñā*), O witchcraft, thy maker, as a daughter her own  
father.

### Notes
The definition of this verse appears to be omitted in the Anukr., as we  
can hardly be meant to take it for an *anuṣṭubh*. The first pāda is  
capable of being crowded together into 8 syllables, or expanded into 12  
(either procedure being about equally strained), making the verse either  
an *urobṛhatī* or a *prastārapan̄kti*. It is quoted in Kāuś. 39. 18.

Anointed, balmed, and well adorned, bearing all trouble with thee, go. Even as a daughter knows her sire, so know thy marker, Kritya, thou.
