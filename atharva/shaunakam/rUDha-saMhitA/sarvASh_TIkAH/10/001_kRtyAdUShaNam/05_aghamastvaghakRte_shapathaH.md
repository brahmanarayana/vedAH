### Translation
5. Let evil be to the evil-doer, a curse to the curser; backward we send  
\[her\] forth back, that she may slay the witchcraft-maker.

### Notes
Ppp. reads for **a** *kṛtyās santu kṛtyākṛte*, and, for **c, d**  
*pratyak pratipravartaya yaś cakāra turn ṛcchatu*. To read in our **c**  
*hiṇmasi* (as Ppp. in vs. 2 **c**) would rectify the meter, of whose  
irregularity the Anukr. takes no notice. The *pada*-reading  
*prati॰prahiṇmaḥ* is by Prāt. iv. 95; the word is quoted there in the  
comment as example.

Ill fall on him who doeth ill, on him who curseth fall the curse! We drive her back that she may slay the man who wrought the witchery.
