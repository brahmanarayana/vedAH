### Translation
1. She whom the adepts {*cikitsú*) prepare, all-formed, hand-made, like  
a bride at a wedding—let her go far off; we push her away.

### Notes
'She,' because kṛtyā 'witchcraft' is feminine. The name, *mahābṛhatī*,  
given to the verse, is improperly applied, ⌊if we understand it as  
defined by RV. Prāt. xvi. 48: here is meant rather that defined as of  
three *jāgata* pādas (12 + 12: 11) at *Ind. Stud.* viii. 243⌋.
