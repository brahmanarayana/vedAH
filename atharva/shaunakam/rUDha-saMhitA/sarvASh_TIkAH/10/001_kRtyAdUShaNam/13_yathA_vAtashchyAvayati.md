### Translation
13. As the wind sets in motion the dust from the earth and the cloud  
(*abhrá*) from the atmosphere, so from me may everything of evil nature  
go away, pushed by the spell (*bráhman*).

As the wind stirs the dust from earth and drives the rain cloud from the sky, So, chased and banished by the spell, all misery departs from me.
