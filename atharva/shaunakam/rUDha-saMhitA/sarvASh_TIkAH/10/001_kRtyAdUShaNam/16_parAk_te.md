### Translation
16. Offward is light for thee, hitherward is no road for thee; make thy  
goings elsewhere than \[toward\] us; go thou by a distant \[road\]  
beyond ninety difficult navigable streams; do not wound thyself; go  
away.

### Notes
One would like to emend *kṣaṇiṣṭhās* in **d**, perhaps to *kṣamiṣṭhās*  
'be patient' i.e. 'linger'; Ppp. has instead *ghāniṣṭhās*, which  
unfortunately gives no help. Ppp. also combines *nāvyā ’ti* in **c**;  
and the description of the Anukr. appears to sanction it.

No path leads hitherward for thee to travel. Turn thee from us: far off, thy light is yonder. Fly hence across the ninety floods, the rivers most hard to pass. Begone, and be not wounded.
