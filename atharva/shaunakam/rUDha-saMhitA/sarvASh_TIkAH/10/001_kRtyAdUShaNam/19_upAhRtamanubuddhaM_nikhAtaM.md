### Translation
19. We have found out (*anu-vid*) the hostile sneaking magic (?  
*kártra*) that was applied, perceived (? *anu-budh*), buried: let that  
go whence it was brought; there let it roll about like a horse; let it  
slay the progeny of the witchcraft -maker.

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **c** *āgatam* for *ābhṛtam*, and combines in **d** *aśve  
’va*, as called for by the meter. The Anukr. is as bad in its treatment  
of this verse as of 15.

That tool of hatred, understood, made ready, stealthy and buried deep, have we discovered, Let that go back to whence it came, turn thither like a horse and kill the children of the sorcerer.
