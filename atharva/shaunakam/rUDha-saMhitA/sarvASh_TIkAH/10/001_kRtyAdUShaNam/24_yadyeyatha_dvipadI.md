### Translation
24. If thou camest \[as\] biped, as quadruped, put together by the  
witchcraft-maker, all-formed, do thou, becoming octoped, go away again  
from here, O misfortune!

### Notes
The verse has the same structure as 20. The *pada*-text here and in vs.  
28 reads *ā॰iyátha*.

If thou hast come two-footed or four-footed, made by the sorcerer, wrought in perfect beauty, Become eight-footed and go hence. Speed back again, thou evil one.
