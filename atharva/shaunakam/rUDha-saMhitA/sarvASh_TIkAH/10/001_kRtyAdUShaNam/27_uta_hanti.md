### Translation
27. Also the after one (*ápara*) slays with an arrow, fitting it (?),  
the one shooting (*-āsin*) in front; also of the front one, smiting  
down, the after one smites down in return.

### Notes
This obscure and probably corrupt verse gets no help from Ppp., which  
merely reads *uto* for *uta* in **c**. The Pet. Lex. suggests emendation  
of *-dā́ya* to *-dhā́ya* in **b**, and the translation implies the change.

He waits, and aiming with his shaft smites him who first would shoot at him, And, when the foeman deals a blow before him, following strikes him down.
