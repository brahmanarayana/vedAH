### Translation
12. From sin against the gods, against the Fathers, from name-taking,  
that is designed, that is devised against \[any one\], let the plants  
free thee by their energy (*vīryà*), with spell (*bráhman*), with  
verses, with milk of the seers.

### Notes
'Milk' (*páyas*) in the last pāda looks like a corrupt reading, but Ppp.  
appears to have the same; Bp.E. accent *payasā́*. ⌊As for the  
combinations of *-ā ṛ-*, see note to Prāt. iii. 46.⌋ Several mss.  
(Bp.O.p.m.R.T.K.) read *pitryā̀t* in **a**. The verse, which ought to be  
called an *anuṣṭubgarbhā triṣṭubh* (11 + 8: 11 + 11 = 41), is very  
foolishly described by the Anukr. as a *pan̄kti*, because it contains  
nearly (and can easily be reduced to precisely) 40 syllables.

From mention of thy name, from sin against the Fathers or the Gods, These herbs of healing shall by prayer release thee, by power, by holy texts, the milk of .Rishis.
