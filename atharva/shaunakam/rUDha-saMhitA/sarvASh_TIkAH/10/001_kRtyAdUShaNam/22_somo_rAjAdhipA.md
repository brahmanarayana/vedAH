### Translation
22. King Soma \[is\] our over-ruler and favorer (*mṛḍitṛ́*); let the  
lords of being favor us.

### Notes
The verse properly contains 22 syllables (11 + 11), and should therefore  
be called a *sāmnī triṣṭubh*. Ppp. reads in **b** *ṛtasya naṣ*.

May Soma, gracious friend, imperial Sovran, and the world's Masters look on us with favour.
