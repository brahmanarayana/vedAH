### Translation
6. Opposed \[is\] the Ān̄girasa, our appointed (*puróhita*) overseer; do  
thou, having turned the witchcrafts in the opposite direction, slay  
yonder witchcraft-makers.

### Notes
Ppp. is corrupt, mixing up our verses 6 and 7. It combines *pratīcīnā  
”n̄gi-* in 6 **a**.

Against her comes the Angirasa, the Priest whose eye is over us. Turn back all witcheries and slay those practisers of magic arts.
