### Translation
30. If ye are covered (*ā-vṛ*) with darkness, like those who are girt  
(*abhi-dhā*) with a net—having torn up (*sam-lup*) all witchcrafts from  
here, we send them forth again to the maker.

### Notes
The *pada*-txt strangely reads *ā́॰vṛtā* in **a**, instead of *-tāḥ*.

If ye be girt about with clouds of darkness, bound as with a net. We rend and tear all witcheries hence and to their maker send them back.
