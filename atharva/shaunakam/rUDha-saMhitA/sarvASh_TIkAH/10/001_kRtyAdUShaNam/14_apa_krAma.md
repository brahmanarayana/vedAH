### Translation
14. Step away, making much noise, like an unfastened she-ass; attain  
thy makers, pushed hence by an energetic spell.

### Notes
Some of the mss. (O.p.m.K.) read *kartrén* in **c**, as in other such  
cases.

Go with a resonant cry, depart, like a she-ass whose cords are loosed. Go to thy makers: hence! away! Go driven by the potent spell.
