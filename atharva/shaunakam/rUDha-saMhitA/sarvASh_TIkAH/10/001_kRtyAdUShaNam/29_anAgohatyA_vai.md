### Translation
29. The slaying of an innocent person is indeed fearful, O witchcraft;  
slay thou not our cow, horse, man; wheresoever thou art set down, from  
there we make thee stand up; become thou lighter than a leaf.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The *pada*-text has in **d** *út: sthāp-*; the example of the omitted  
*s* is quoted under Prāt. ii. 18. The verse (10+ 10: 8 + 8 + 8 = 44) is  
very badly defined by the Anukr. Ppp. reads in **a** *-hatyam* and  
*bhīmam*.

The slaughter of an innocent, O Kritya, is an awful deed. Slay not cow, horse, or man of ours. In whatsoever place thou art concealed we rouse thee up there- from: become thou lighter than a leaf.
