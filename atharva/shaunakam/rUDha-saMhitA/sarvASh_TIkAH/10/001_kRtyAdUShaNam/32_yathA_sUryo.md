### Translation
32. As the sun is freed out of darkness, \[and\] quits the night and the  
ensigns of the dawn, so do I quit all evil-natured magic made by the  
witchcraft-maker, as an elephant the difficult haze (? *rájas*).

### Notes
Ppp. puts *tamasas* before *mucyate* in **a**, reads *ketum* at end of  
**b**, and omits **d** altogether. The verse (12 + 11: 8 + 8 + 11 = 50)  
lacks two syllables of being a full *atijagatī* (52). The *pratīka*  
(*yathā sūrya*) is quoted in Kāuś. 39. 26; but the comm. regards vii.  
13. 1, and not this, as the verse intended.  
  
⌊The quoted Anukr. says *dve* (i.e. 2 above the norm of 30).⌋

As Surya frees himself from depth of darkness, and casts away the night and rays of morning, So I repel each baleful charm which an enchanter hath pre- pared; And, as an elephant shakes off the dust, I cast the plague aside.
