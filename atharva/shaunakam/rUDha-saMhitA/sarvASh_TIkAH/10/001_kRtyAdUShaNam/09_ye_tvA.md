### Translation
9. They who, having made, took hold of thee, cunning sorcerers—this is a  
healthful (*śambhú*) spoiler of witchcraft, counteracting, reverting;  
therewith do we bathe thee.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The address changes, as often elsewhere, from the witchcraft to the  
bewitched person. Ppp. reads, in **c**, *vidma* for *śambhu*, and, in  
**d**, *pratisaram*. Our text ought to read in **c** *śambhv ìdám*,  
although all the mss. happen to agree here in lengthening the *i*.

The cunning men, the sorcerers who fashioned thee and held thee fast,-- This cures and mars their witchery, this, repellent, drives it back the way it came. With this we make thee swim.
