### Translation
15. Saying "this is the road, O witchcraft," we conduct thee; thee that  
wast sent forth against \[us\] we send forth back again; by that  
\[road\] go against \[them\], breaking, like a draft-cow with a cart,  
all-formed, wearing a wreath (? *kurūṭín*).

### Notes
The last word is found only here, and has to be rendered conjecturally  
(with the Pet. Lexx.). All the *saṁhitā*-mss. ⌊or rather, most of them:  
see also note to Prāt. iii. 35⌋ combine *kṛtyé ’ti* ⌊and thus indeed the  
meter requires us to pronounce⌋; but our edition restores the more  
correct reading ⌊*kṛtya íti*⌋, since the Prāt. does not countenance the  
irregularity; we should expect to find it with *vandane ’va* (in ii.  
56). Ppp. reads at the beginning *ayaṁ panthā ’pinayāmi tvā kṛtye  
prahitāṁ prati* etc.; in **c** ⌊or rather **c-d**⌋, *tuñjaty anasvinī  
’va*. In the Anukr. it seems as if *catuṣpadā*. must be a misreading for  
*pañcapadā* (11 + 11: 8 + 8 + 8 = 46): but compare vs. 19.

This, Kritya, is thy path, we say, and guide thee. We drive thee back who hast been sent against us. Go by this pathway, breaking loose for onslaught even as a host complete with cars and horses.
