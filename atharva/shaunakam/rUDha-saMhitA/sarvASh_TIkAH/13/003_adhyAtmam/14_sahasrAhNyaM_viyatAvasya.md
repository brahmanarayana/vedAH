### Translation
14. A thousand days' journey are expanded the wings of him, of the  
yellow swan flying to heaven; he, putting all the gods in his breast,  
goes viewing together all existences.—Against that god etc. etc.

### Notes
The verse proper here is a repetition of x. 8. 18 and xiii. 2. 38; it is  
written in full in all the mss., because they have no other way of  
indicating the attachment here of the refrain. It is properly an *ākṛti*  
(8 × 11 = 88 syll.).
