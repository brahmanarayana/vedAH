### Translation
24. He who is self-giving, strength-giving, of whom all, of whom  
\[even\] the gods wait upon the direction, who is master of these  
bipeds, who of quadrupeds—against that god etc. etc.

### Notes
The verse proper is identical with the first three pādas of iv. 2. 1  
(found also in other texts: see the notes to that hymn). Bp. here reads  
(doubtless by accident) *asya* in **c**. Two more syllables are needed  
to make a full *kṛti* (80 syll.).
