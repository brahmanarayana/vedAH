### Translation
7. Who became food-eater, lord of food, and also Brahmaṇaspati (lord of  
worship); who is and shall be lord of existence—against that god etc.  
etc.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The translation implies *bhaviṣyán* instead of *-yát* in **c**; either  
this emendation or that of *bhūtás* to *bhūtám* (which Ludwig and Henry  
assume in their versions) seems unavoidable. Our *saṁhitā*-mss. are  
divided between *-dó ánnapatir* and *-dó ‘nna-* in **a**. The verse (11  
+ 8: 12: 44 = 75) is very near a regular *atidhṛti* (76 syll.). ⌊Cf.  
note to vs. 6 for use by Kāuś.⌋
