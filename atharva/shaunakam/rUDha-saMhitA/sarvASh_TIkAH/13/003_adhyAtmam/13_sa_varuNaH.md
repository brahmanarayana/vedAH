### Translation
13. This Agni becomes Varuṇa in the evening; in the morning, rising, he  
becomes Mitra; he, having become Savitar, goes through the atmosphere;  
he, having become Indra, burns (*tap*) through the midst of the  
sky.—Against that god etc. etc.

### Notes
Or (**a**) 'he becomes Varuṇa at evening \[and\] Agni' (so Henry: cf.  
Ludwig). The verse is very irregular, but can be made to count a  
*vikṛti* (92 syll.).
