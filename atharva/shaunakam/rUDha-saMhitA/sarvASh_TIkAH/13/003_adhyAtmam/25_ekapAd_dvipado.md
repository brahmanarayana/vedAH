### Translation
25. The one-footed strode out more than the two-footed; the two-footed  
falls upon the three-footed from behind; the four-footed acted within  
the call of the two-footed ones, beholding the series (*pan̄tí*), drawing  
near (*upa-sthā*).—Against that god etc. etc.

### Notes
The first two pādas are identical with 2. 27 **a, b**, and the whole  
verse corresponds to RV. X. 117. 8. RV. reads in **a** *bhū́yo dvipádo*,  
in **b** *dvipā́t tripā́dam*, in **c** *eti* (for *cakre*) *dvipádām*, in  
**d** *pan̄ktī́r up-*. The accentuation *dvípāt* and *trípāt* (only in  
these verses) was noticed under 2. 27. Here we lack two syllables of a  
full *vikṛti*.

The single-footed hath outstepped the biped, the biped overtakes the triple-footed. The quadruped hath wrought when bipeds called him, standing and looking on the five collected. This God is wroth offended by the sinner that wrongs the Brahman who hath gained this knowledge. Agitate him, O Rohita; destroy him: entangle in thy snares the Brahman's tyrant.
