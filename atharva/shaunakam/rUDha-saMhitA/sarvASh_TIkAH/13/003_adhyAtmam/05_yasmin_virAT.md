### Translation
5. In whom is set (*śritá*) Virāj, the most exalted one, Prajāpati, Agni  
Vāiśvānara with the series (*pan̄ktí*); who took to himself the breath of  
the lofty one, the brilliancy of the loftiest one—against that god etc.  
etc.

### Notes
We had nearly the same combination of divine personages above in viii.  
5. 10 **c, d**; and the *pan̄kti* here perhaps corresponds to the 'all  
the seers' there. The verse, of very irregular meter (12 + 12: 15: 44 =  
83), is very nearly a *prakṛti* (84 syll.).
