### Comment
Of this hymn only one verse is found in Pāipp., namely vs. 10 in iv. Vāit. makes use of no part of it; and Kāuś. ⌊49. 19⌋ only of the first verse. ⌊Caland, p. 173, understands the whole hymn to be intended at 49. 19; and takes 49. 24 and 25 as referring to vss. 6 and 7 of this hymn.⌋ *⌊The definition of vs. 26 (anuṣṭubh) appears to be omitted.—The individual pādas of this hymn are largely of genuine triṣṭubh measure and cadence, occasionally jagatī; and this is possibly the intention of the "trāiṣṭubham" of the Anukr. (for not a single verse foots up as 44 syllables): then, again, if to the verse proper in each case we add the refrain and reckon up the totals, we get the ākṛtis etc. of the Anukr.⌋
