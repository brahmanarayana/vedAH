### Translation
1. He who generated these two, heaven-and-earth; who clothes himself in  
existences, making them a garment (*drā́pi*); in whom abide the six wide  
directions, toward which he, the flying one, looks all abroad—against  
that god, angered, \[is\] this offense (*ā́gas*); whoso scathes a Brahman  
that knows thus, do thou, O ruddy one, make him quake, destroy him;  
fasten on the fetters of the Brahman-scather.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
All the mss. agree in the accent of *drā́pi* (RV. always *drāpí*). As is  
their habit, they give of the refrain only the single word *tásya*  
except in vss. 1 and 25; and there they set the *avasāna* not before  
*tásya*, but after *devásya:* in our edition this perversion of the  
natural division is corrected. The refrain, if we contract *yá evám* to  
*yāí ’vám*, is a regular *triṣṭubh;* its addition to a preceding verse  
makes this hymn one of especially long meters; the first verse, 8 pādas  
of 11 syllables each, is an exact *ākṛti*. The verse ⌊or the hymn: see  
introduction⌋ is (though v. 12. 9 has the same *pratīka*) doubtless the  
one quoted in Kāuś. 49. 19, with xiii. 1. 28 and xvi. 6. 1, to accompany  
the laying on of fetters; and Bloomfield suggests that the whole hymn  
(or *anuvāka*) is intended also in 63. 21, one does not see why.

He who engendered these, the earth and heaven, who made the worlds the mantle that he weareth, In whom abide the six wide-spreading regions through which the Bird's keen vision penetrateth, This God is wroth offended by the sinner who wrongs the Brahman who hath gained this knowledge Agitate him, O Rohita; destroy him: entangle in thy snares the Braman's tyrant.
