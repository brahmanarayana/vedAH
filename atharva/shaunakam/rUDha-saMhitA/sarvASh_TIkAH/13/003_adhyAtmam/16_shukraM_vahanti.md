### Translation
16. Swift-running yellow \[horses\] draw the bright one (*śukrá*), the  
god shining with splendor in the sky, whose lofty bodies heat the sky;  
hitherward with well-colored gleams (? *paṭará*) he shines  
forth.—Against that god etc. etc.

### Notes
Our edition ought to give in **c** *tanvàs*, since that is the  
*pada*-reading, and it is only by accident that nearly all the  
*saṁhitā*-mss. (all save R.K.) unite in protracting the *à* to *ā̀*. The  
verse reads most naturally as a *bhurig ākṛti* (12 + ll: l1 + 11: 44 =  
89).

With flying feet his tawny coursers carry the bright God through, the sky, aglow with splendour. Whose limbs uplifted fire and heat the heavens: hither he shines- with beams of golden colour. This God, etc.
