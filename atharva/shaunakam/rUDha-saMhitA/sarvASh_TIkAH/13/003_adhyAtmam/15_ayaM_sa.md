### Translation
15. This is that god within the waters, the thousand-rooted,  
many-powered (?) Atri; he who generated all this existence—against that  
god etc. etc.

### Notes
Henry makes in **b** the naturally-suggested emendation to *puruśā́khas*,  
'many-branched'; ⌊cf. Bloomfield, AJP. xii. 436, and, *per contra*,  
Deussen, p. 228, note⌋. The verse is most naturally read as (9 + 11: 11:  
44 = 75) a *nicṛd atidhṛti*, in accordance with the description of the  
Anukr.
