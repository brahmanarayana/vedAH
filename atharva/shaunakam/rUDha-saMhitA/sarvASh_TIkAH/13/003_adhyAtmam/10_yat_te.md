### Translation
10. What of thee, O Kaśyapa, is bright (*candrá*), full of shining  
(*rocanā́vant*), what that is combined (*saṁhitá*), splendid (*puṣkalá*),  
of wondrous light, in which seven suns are set (*ā́rpita*)  
together—against that god etc. etc.

### Notes
One of our mss. (T.: ⌊and perhaps also M.⌋) ⌊and one of SPP's⌋ accent  
*púṣkalam* (like *púṣkara*) in **b**. All ⌊of W's and of SPP's⌋ agree in  
the anomalous and probably incorrect accent *saṁhitám*. ⌊C.f., however,  
*Gram.* § 1085 b. Perhaps the case of *saṁskṛtám* at xi. 1. 35 is not  
parallel.⌋ Ppp. has (as noticed above) this verse, reading in **a**  
*kaśyapo ro-*, combining in **c** *suryā ”rpitās sapta*, and ⌊without  
*avasāna* after *sākam*⌋ having, as was to be expected, a wholly  
different apodosis: *tasmin rajānam adhi vi śraye ’mam* (cf. our ix. 5.  
4 **d**), for which the refrain of this hymn is a senseless substitute.  
The verse is found also in K. xxxvii. 9. Our Bp. omits, by accident, the  
division-sign of rocaná॰vat in **a**.
