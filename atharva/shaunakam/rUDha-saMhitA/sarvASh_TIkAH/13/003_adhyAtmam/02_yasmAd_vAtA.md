### Translation
2. From whom the winds in their season go purifying (*pū*), out of whom  
the oceans flow forth—against that god etc. etc.

### Notes
With **b** compare 1. 42 **d**. The verse (10 + 11: 44 = 65) has one  
more syllable than a regular *aṣṭi*, as the Anukr. notices. ⌊The longer  
grammatical equivalent of *vā́tās* would improve the rhythm.⌋
