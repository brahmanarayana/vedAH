### Translation
8. His is this troop of Maruts; he goes sling-made.

### Notes
That is (?), 'as if hung in slings ' ⌊OB. 'an Schnüre gehängt'⌋. Henry  
makes a venturesome and unacceptable emendation, and regards the  
adjective as referring to the 'troop '—which is not impossible.

His are these banded Maruts: they move gathered close like porters' thongs.
