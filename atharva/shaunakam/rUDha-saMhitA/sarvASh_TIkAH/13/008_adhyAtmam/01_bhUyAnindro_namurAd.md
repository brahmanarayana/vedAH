### Translation
46. More is Indra than non-dying (??); more art thou, O Indra, than the  
deaths.

### Notes
'Non-dying' is the conjecture of the Pet. Lexx. for *namurá*, which  
occurs nowhere else; it is adopted here, simply for lack of anything  
better, although in itself of a high degree of implausibility. ⌊Henry  
also adopts it; but see his note, p. 54.⌋ It is surprising to find Indra  
brought in here at the end for address, instead of the sun; there is  
nothing to show that the two remaining *paryāyas* are not for him.  
⌊Note, however, the praise of the sun under the names of Indra and  
Viṣṇu, so prominent in book xvii., below: see page 805. Perhaps we have  
here a similar identification.⌋
