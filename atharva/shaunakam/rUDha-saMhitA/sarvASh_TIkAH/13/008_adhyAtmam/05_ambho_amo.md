### Translation
50. As called water (? *ámbhas*), force (*áma*), greatness, power, do  
we worship thee.

### Notes
The Anukr. ratifies the combination *ámbho ámo*. By a usage that is  
rare, all the mss. omit in this verse ⌊what follows⌋ after *íti*,  
although the repetition is not of the end of the next preceding verse,  
but of vs. 47. Then, of course, the following verses are written in the  
same curtailed way until vs. 54, which is filled out to the end.
