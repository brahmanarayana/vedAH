### Translation
26. He \[is\] Rudra, winner of good, in the giving of good; in the  
expression of homage, \[he is\] the utterance *váṣaṭ*, put together  
after.

### Notes
The connection here is very doubtful. Henry understands it as above;  
Muir (iv. 338) quite differently. The verse is very peculiarly treated  
by the Anukr.; first it is quoted in its proper place thus: *sa rudra  
ity ārṣī* (so the Berlin ms., but the London ms. has *āsurī*) *gāyatrī;*  
and then, after the definition of vss. 27, 28, the London ms. says again  
*sa rudro vasuvanir ārcy anuṣṭup*. The descriptions *ārṣī gāyatrī* and  
*ārcy anuṣṭubh* (each implying 24 syllables) both apply equally well, if  
we restore *-kāró ánu*.
