### Translation
42. He, mounting, glowing \[and\] unwearied, the great \[spaces\], makes  
for himself, shining (*ruc*), two forms; wondrous, understanding,  
⌊bull,⌋ wind-going (??), when he shines out (*vi-bhā*) upon as many  
worlds \[as there are\].

### Notes
That is, 'upon all existing worlds.' The second pāda is 28 **b** above;  
the third, nearly 32 **a**. The rendering of *vātamāyās* (p.  
*vā́tam॰āyāḥ*) in **c** is purely to fill up the text. Henry emends to  
*vā́tam ā́pas;* Ludwig renders 'possessing wind-magic' The Anukr. passes  
without notice the redundant syllable in **c**. Ppp. has a quite  
different version of much of the verse: *ārohan chakro vṛhatīr yuṁktor  
amartyāṣ kṛṇuṣe vīryāni: divyas suparṇo muhiṣaṁ vātaraṅhāya: sarvāṅl  
lokāṅ abhi* etc. This would suggest *vātaraṅhās* 'wind-swift' as  
emendation of *vātamāyās*.
