### Translation
45. The greatness of him exceeds (*pári*) the earth, the ocean; shining  
abroad with light, it exceeds (*pári*) the sky, the atmosphere;  
beholding the all, beneficent, reverend, let him hear this which I say.

### Notes
Ppp. again objects to our second half-verse, and gives instead:  
*ahorātrābhyāṁ saha saṁvasānā uṣā nīyus pratarād aviṣṭam*. The  
"*jagatī*" is again a very rough one ⌊as the Anukr. in part admits⌋. ⌊W.  
interlines "encompasses" as an alternative to "exceeds."⌋

Blazing with light his majesty hath compassed ocean and earth and heaven and air's mid-region. May he, all-seeing, well-disposed and holy, give ear and listen to the word I utter.
