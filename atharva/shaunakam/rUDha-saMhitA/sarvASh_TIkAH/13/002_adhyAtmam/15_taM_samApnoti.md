### Translation
15. That one he attains completely (*sam-āp*) with his swiftnesses;  
that he desires not to neglect (? *apa-cikits*); by that \[men\] do not  
appropriate the gods' draught of immortality (*amṛ́ta*).

### Notes
*Apa-cikits*, lit. 'desire to think away from,' with abl.; the  
expression is found only here. The logic of **d** is not obvious; Henry  
supplies 'the demons' as subject of *áva rundhate;* Ludwig renders it as  
a singular. Ppp. reads *jigitsati* in **b**; and, in **c** etc.,  
*bhakṣaṇaṁ devānān naṁ va ru-*; *bhakṣaṇam* is an improvement; the meter  
of **c** halts badly without it.

He finishes his race with speed and never turns his thought aside, Thereby he keeps not from the Gods enjoyment of the Drink of Life.
