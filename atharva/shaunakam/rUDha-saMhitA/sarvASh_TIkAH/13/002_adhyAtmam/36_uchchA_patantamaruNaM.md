### Translation
36. Flying on high (*uccā́*), the red eagle, in the midst of the sky  
hasting, shining—may we see thee, whom men call the impeller (*savitṛ́*),  
the unfailing light which Atri found.

### Notes
Ppp. has the better reading *paśyema* in **c**. ⌊Restore the lost  
accent-mark under the *ṇim* of *taráṇim*.⌋

High in the midst of heaven may we behold thee whom men call Savitar, the bright red Eagle, Soaring and speeding on thy way, refulgent, unwasting light which Atri erst discovered.
