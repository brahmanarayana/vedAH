### Translation
35. The wondrous front of the gods hath arisen, the eye of Mitra, of  
Varuṇa, of Agni; he hath filled heaven-and-earth, the atmosphere; the  
sun is the soul of the moving creation (*jágat*) and of the stationary  
(*tasthivā́ṅs*).

### Notes
The verse is RV. i. 115. 1 (only variant *ā́: aprāḥ* in **c**), and it is  
found almost everywhere else: thus, in SV. (i. 630: Nāigeya appendix),  
VS. (vii. 42; xiii. 46), TS. (1. 4. 43¹; ii. 4. 14⁴), TB. (ii. 8. 7³),  
TA. (i. 7. 6; ii. 13. 1), MS. (i. 3. 37), AA. (iii. 2. 3); all have the  
same text as RV.; and so, apparently, has Ppp., ⌊combining, however,  
*āprādyā-*⌋. ⌊Deussen, *Geschichte*, i. 1. 213, interprets the vs.⌋ The  
quotation in Vāit. 33. 6 evidently applies to the verse as AV. xx. 107.  
14. ⌊in **d**, *jágas tas-* is a misprint for *jágatas tas-*: an  
interesting instance of most modern haplography.⌋
