### Translation
23. Seven yellow steeds, O heavenly sun, draw in the chariot thee the  
flame-haired, the out-looking.

### Notes
RV. reads at the end *vicakṣaṇa*, and SV. (i. 641) and TS. (ii. 4. 14⁴)  
agree with it. MS. (iv. 10. 6) has instead *purupriya*, and, in the  
preceding word, *śocíḥk-*.
