### Translation
22. Thou goest through the sky, the broad welkin (*rájas*), fashioning  
(*mā*) the day with \[thy\] rays, seeing the generations (*jánman*), O  
sun.

### Notes
RV. reads *áhā* in **b**. S V. (i. 639) has the same, and also *úd* for  
*ví* at the beginning, and *rájaḥ p-*. Henry again renders *aktúbhis*  
'with the night.'
