### Translation
28. When, about to go unwearied, he hath approached (*ā-sthā*) his  
yellow steeds, he, shining (*ruc*), makes for himself two forms; rising  
rich in lights (*ketú-*), overpowering the dim spaces (*rájas*), thou  
illuminest (*vi-bhā*), O Āditya, all the advances.

### Notes
Ppp. has for **b** *divi rūpaṁ* ⌊*kṛṇuṣe;* it further combines *viśvā  
”ditya* in **d**⌋. ⌊Pāda **b** is identical with 42 **b**.⌋ ⌊Pischel  
translates the vs., *Ved. Stud.* ii. 76.⌋

When he, unwearied, fain to go, hath mounted his bays, he makes two colours, brightly shining. Rising with banners, conquering the regions, thou sendest light through all the floods, Aditya.
