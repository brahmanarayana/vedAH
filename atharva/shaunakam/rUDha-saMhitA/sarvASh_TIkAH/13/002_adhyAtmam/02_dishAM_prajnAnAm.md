### Translation
2. \[Him,\] shining (*svar*) with the brightness (*arcís*) of the  
foreknowing quarters, well-winged, flying swift in the ocean  
(*arṇavá*)—we would praise the sun, the shepherd of existence, who with  
his rays shines unto all the quarters.

### Notes
The Pet. Lex. (followed by Henry) emends *prajñā́nām* to *prajñā́nam*,  
with much plausibility; yet it is opposed by x. 7. 34, *díśo yáś cakré  
prajñā́nīḥ*. Ppp. reads *prajñānaṁ svadayanto arc-*; and it combines in  
**d** *diśā ”bhāti*. The verse lacks two syllables of being a proper  
*jagatī*.

Let us laud him, the whole world's Herdsman, Surya, who with his rays illumines all the regions, Mark of the quarters, brightening them with lustre, swift, mighty-pinioned, flying in the ocean.
