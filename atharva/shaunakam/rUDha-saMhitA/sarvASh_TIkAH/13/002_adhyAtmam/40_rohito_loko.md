### Translation
40. The ruddy one became the world; the ruddy one overheated the sky;  
the ruddy one with his rays goes about over the earth, the ocean.

### Notes
Or (**b**) 'went heating across the sky' (so Henry). Ppp. reads in **a**  
*bhūto ‘bhavat*, omits **b**, and has *bhūmyaṁ* in **c** ⌊cf. its  
*nāryaṁ* for *nārīm*, xiv. 1. 59, note⌋.
