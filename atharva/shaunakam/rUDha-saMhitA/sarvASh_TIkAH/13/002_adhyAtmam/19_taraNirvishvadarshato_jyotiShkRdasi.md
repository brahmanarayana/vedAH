### Translation
19. Speedy, conspicuous to all, light-making art thou, O sun; thou  
shinest unto everything, O bright space (*rocaná*).

### Notes
All our mss. read at the end *rocana*, save Bs., which has *rocanam*,  
and M., *rocanám* and the translation follows them, although the word is  
a senseless variant of *rocanám*, which is given by RV., and by all the  
other texts: SV. (i. 636), VS. (xxxiii. 36), TS. (i. 4. 31¹), TA. (iii.  
16. 1), and MS. (iv. 10. 6). Ppp. has *rocanā*.

Swift and all-beautiful art thou, O Surya, maker of the light, Illuming all the radiant realm.
