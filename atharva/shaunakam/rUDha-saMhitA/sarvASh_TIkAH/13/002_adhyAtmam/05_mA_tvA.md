### Translation
5. Let them not damage thee going around upon thy race; happily do thou  
cross the difficulties quickly; when, O sun, thou goest to both sky and  
divine earth, measuring out day-and-night.

### Notes
Or, 'sky' and 'earth' may be joint objects of 'measuring' (so Henry, and  
apparently Ludwig). Ppp. reads *paryantam* in **a**, and *sugena durgam*  
in **b**. We have to make the, in its situation, awkward resolution  
*tu-ā* in a in order to fill out the meter; ⌊or *-yāantam*?⌋.

Let them not snare thee speeding on thy journey: pass safely, swiftly places hard to traverse, While measuring out the day and night thou movest--O Surya, even Heaven and Earth the Goddess.
