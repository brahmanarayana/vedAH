### Translation
13. Thou rushest alike (? *sam-ṛṣ*) to both borders, as a calf to two  
joint mothers; surely (*nanú*), that *bráhman* yon gods have long known.

### Notes
A naïve extension of the usual naïve figure of the calf: as if he had  
two mothers, to each of which he showed equal attachment. *Bráhman*,  
apparently 'sacred mystery' (so Henry). In **d**, lit. 'know of old from  
now.'

As the Calf both his parents so thou joinest both the distant bounds, Surely the Gods up yonder knew this sacred mystery long ago.
