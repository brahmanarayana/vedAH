### Translation
8. The sun hath yoked in his chariot, in order to go, his seven great  
yellow steeds, golden-skinned; the bright one hath been freed from the  
dimness (? *rájas*) in the distance; shaking away the darkness, the god  
hath mounted the sky.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Ppp. reads *śūras* for *sūryas* in **a**, and *śakras* for *śukras* in  
**c**, and apparently *ayun̄kta* in **b**. The verse is very ill defined  
as simple *jagatī;* the true reading in **b** would seem to be  
*híraṇyatvacas*.

Surya hath harnessed to his car to draw him seven stately bay steeds gay with wolden housings. The Bright One started from the distant region: dispelling gloom the God hath climbed the heavens.
