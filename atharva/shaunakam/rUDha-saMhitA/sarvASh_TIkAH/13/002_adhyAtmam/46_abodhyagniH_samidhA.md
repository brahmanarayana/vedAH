### Translation
46. Agni hath been awakened by the kindling of men to meet the dawn  
coming like a milch-cow; like young (*yahvá*) \[birds?\] rising forth to  
a branch, the lights (*bhānú*) go forth unto the firmament (*nā́ka*).

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **d** *sasṛje*. The verse is RV. v. 1. 1, and is found  
also in other texts: SV. (i. 73; ii. 1096), VS. (xv. 24), TS. (iv. 4.  
4¹), and MS. (ii. 13. 7), everywhere without a variant. ⌊SV. (both  
occurrences) reads *sasrate* in **d**; TS. accents *achá* at the end.⌋  
It is quoted in Vāit. 29. 8, apparently in connection with the verses  
that follow it in RV. (*iti trāiṣṭubhīḥ*).  
  
⌊Here ends the second *anuvāka*, with 1 hymn and 46 verses. The quoted  
Anukr. says *ṣaṭ śatvāriṅśat*.⌋

Agni is weakened by the people's fuel to meet the Dawn who cometh like a milch-cow, Like young trees shooting up on high their branches, his flames are mounting to the vault of heaven.
