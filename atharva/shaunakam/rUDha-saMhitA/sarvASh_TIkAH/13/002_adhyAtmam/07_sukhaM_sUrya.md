### Translation
7. Mount (*adhi-sthā*), O sun, thine easy-running chariot, rich in rays,  
pleasant, well-horsed, powerful (? *vājín*), which thy yellow steeds, of  
excellent draught, draw: a hundred horses, or else seven, numerous.

### Notes
All our mss. accent *sū́rya* in **a**; our edition emends to *sūrya*.  
Ppp. has in **b** *syonosyavahnim*. The Anukr. perhaps regards the  
redundant syllable in **b** as balanced by the deficiency in **a**. ⌊Cf.  
6 **c, d**.⌋

Mount thy strong car, O Surya, lightly rolling, drawn by good steeds, propitious, brightly gleaming, Whirled by thy bays, most excellent at drawing, thy hundred horses or seven goodly coursers.
