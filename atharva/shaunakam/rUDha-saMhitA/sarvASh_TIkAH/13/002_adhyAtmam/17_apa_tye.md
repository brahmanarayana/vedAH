### Translation
17. Away go, like thieves, these asterisms with their rays (*aktú*), for  
the all-beholding sun.

### Notes
Or **c** may possibly mean 'for all to behold the sun.' The remaining  
verses (17-24) of the RV. hymn ⌊i.e. i. 50. 1-9⌋ are found in SV. only  
in the Nāigeya appendix to the first book; this one (i. 634) has no  
variant. Henry renders *aktúbhis* 'with the night.'

The Constellations pass away, like thieves, departing in the night. Before the all-beholding Sun.
