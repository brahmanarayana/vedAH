### Translation
18. The lights (*ketú*), the rays of him have been seen abroad among the  
peoples, like shining fires.

beginning *ádṛśram;* the others (SV. i. 635; MS. i. 3. 33) agree with  
our text.

His herald rays are seen afar refulgent o'er the world of men, Like flames of fire that burn and blaze.
