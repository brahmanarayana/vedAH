### Translation
26. He who belongs to all men (*-carṣaṇí*) and has faces on all sides,  
who has hands on all sides and palms on all sides—he brings together  
with his (two) arms, together with his wings (pl.), generating  
heaven-and-earth, sole god.

### Notes
The verse is, with considerable variations, RV. x. 81. 3, found also in  
VS. (xvii. 19: same text as RV.), TS. (iv. 6. 2⁴), TA. (x. 1. 3), and  
MS. (ii. 10. 2). None of the other texts has *yás* in **b**, and only  
MS. in **a**; they begin *viśvátaścākṣur* (but MS. *yó viśvácakṣur*); in  
**b**, RV.VS. begin with *viśvátobāhur*, TS.TA.MS. *-hasta*, and all end  
with *viśvátaspāt;* in **c**, for *bhárati*, RV. (and VS.) has  
*dhámati*, TS.TA. *námati*, MS. *ádhamat;* in **d**, RV.VS.MS. give  
*dyā́vābhū́mī*. Ppp. agrees with RV. in **b-d**. The meter, fairly regular  
in RV., is distorted greatly in our text (13 + 13: 11 + 12 = 49); the  
Anukr. gives an acceptable definition of it. The sense also is much  
defaced in the first line as we have it. Vāit. 29. 14 uses the verse to  
accompany a certain *graha* in the building of the fire-altar.

Dear unto all men, facing all directions, with hands and palms on every side extended, He, the sole God, engendering earth and heaven, beareth them with his wings and arms together.
