### Translation
27. The one-footed strode out more than the two-footed; the two-footed  
falls upon (*abhi-i*) the three-footed from behind; the two-footed  
strode out more than the six-footed; they sit together \[about\] the  
body of the one-footed.

### Notes
*Sam-ās* has no good right to an accusative object; and one of our mss.  
(D.) reads *tanvàm*, loc, which would be grammatically an acceptable  
emendation; as regards the sense, that is too obscure for us to derive  
any help from it. Pādas **b** and **c** are wanting in Ppp., probably  
by accident. The first half-verse nearly agrees with RV. x. 117. 8 **a,  
b**, which (whole) verse corresponds to ⌊the first half of⌋ our 3. 25  
below: see the note there. It is only here and in 3. 25 that we find the  
accentuation *dvípāt* and *trípāt*. ⌊The *pratīka* is quoted by GB. ii.  
9, p. 28, l. 19.⌋ The description of the Anukr. implies an unfounded  
rejection of one of the resolutions *abhí eti* or *tanú-am*.

The single-footed hath outstepped the biped, the biped overtakes the triple-footed. The biped hath outstridden the six-footed: these sit around the single-footed's body.
