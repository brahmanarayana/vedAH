### Translation
44. The earth-filling bull (*mahiṣá*), track of the implorer, of  
undamaged sight, hath encompassed the all; beholding (*sam-paś*) the  
all, beneficent, reverend, let him hear this which I say.

### Notes
'Track' (in **b**), i.e. facilitation or facilitator of progress.  
*Mahiṣas* is an evident intrusion, and the verse is strictly a  
*triṣṭubh* with redundant syllables. Ppp. reads in a *pṛthivipro m.  
bādhamānasya;* for **b**, *adbhutacakṣuṣ pari saṁ babhūva;* and, for  
**d**, *śivāyā nas tanvā śarma yacchāt*, which is found nowhere in our  
text. All our mss. ⌊except D.⌋ agree in accenting *babhū́va*, for no  
discoverable reason. ⌊Five of SPP's authorities (as well as W's D.) read  
*babhūva* without accent.⌋

The suppliant's way, filling the earth, the Mighty circleth the world with eye that none deceiveth. May he, all-seeing, well-disposed and holy, give ear and listen to the word I utter.
