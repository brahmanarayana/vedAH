### Translation
16. This heavenly Jātavedas the lights (*ketú*) draw (*vah*) up, for  
every one to see the sun.

### Notes
Or *sū́ryam* may be in apposition with *jātávedasam*. 'Draw,' i.e. as  
horses do. This verse, with the eight that follow, constitute RV. i. 50.  
1-9, in the same order of verses, and with few variants; they are also  
all found in one or more other Vedic texts: this one in SV. (i. 31), VS.  
(7. 41; 8. 41; 33. 31), TS. (i. 2. 8²; 4. 43¹), and MS. (i. 3. 37)—in  
all, without a variant. The whole hymn ⌊i.e. vss. 16-24⌋ is repeated  
further in xx. 47. 13-21. This verse is used three times in Vāit.: at  
21. 23; at 33. 5 (with the following five verses); and at 39. 16 (with  
the following two verses). ⌊The *pratīka* is cited at MGS. i. 2. 4. The  
frequency of the citation or occurrence of the verse may be judged by  
consulting MGS. Index, p. 148.⌋

His heralds bear him up aloft, the God who knoweth all that live, Surya, that all may look on him.
