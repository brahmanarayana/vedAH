### Translation
4. The inspired, hasting (*taráṇi*), shining one, whom seven numerous  
(*bahú*) yellow steeds (*harít*) draw, whom out of the liquid (?  
*srutá*) Atri conducted up the sky—thee here they see going around upon  
thy race.

### Notes
Half of our mss. appear plainly to read *stutā́t* in **c**, but the  
apparent distinction is of no value; *sr* and *st* are virtually one in  
ms. use. Ppp. helps to establish *sru-*, by reading, for **c, d**,  
*śrutād divam atri divam anyanāya taṁ tvā paśyema paryajitim ājim*. GB.  
i. 2. 17 has **c** (the published text reads *stutād*), with vs. 12 **a,  
b**, as if a verse. ⌊As for the Atri story, cf. my essay on RV. v. 40 in  
*Festgruss an Roth*, p. 187. For the construction of *ājím*, see *Ved.  
Stud.* ii. 261.⌋

Victorious, inspired, and brightly shining, whom seven strong tawny-coloured coursers carry, Whom Atri lifted from the flood to heaven, thus men behold thee as thy course thou runnest.
