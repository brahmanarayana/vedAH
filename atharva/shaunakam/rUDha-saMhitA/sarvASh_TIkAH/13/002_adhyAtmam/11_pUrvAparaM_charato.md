### Translation
11. They two move on one after the other by magic; two playing young  
ones go about the ocean; the one looks abroad upon all beings; yellow  
steeds draw the other with golden \[trappings?\].

### Notes
The first three pādas are identical with vii. 81. 1 **a-c** (repeated at  
xiv. 1. 23), and are found in other texts: see the note to that verse;  
the last pāda is peculiar, and, as applying only to the sun, spoils the  
description of the pair of luminaries, sun and moon, which the verse  
sets out to make. Henry regards the daily and the nightly sun as  
intended, and the *hāiraṇyas* as the stars, by means of which the latter  
finds his way back to the eastern horizon. It would have been better to  
read *yāto ‘rṇavám* here, as in vii. 81. 1, since the majority of our  
*saṁhitā*-mss. (all save Bs.E.) give it in this place also.

Moving by magic power to east and westward, these two young creatures, sporting, circle ocean. One of the pair beholds all living creatures: with wheels of gold the bay steeds bear the other.
