### Translation
24. The sun hath yoked the seven neat (*śundhyú*) daughters of the  
chariot; with them, \[who are\] self-yoked, he goeth.

### Notes
SV. (i. 640) reads in **b** *naptryàḥ*, and TB. (ii. 4. 5⁴), according  
to its commentary, has ⌊*naptriyaḥ*⌋, although *ná príyaḥ* is printed  
instead in the text ⌊of Calcutta, and *naptríyaḥ* in the Poona text, p.  
518⌋. So also in **c**, ⌊the Calc. ed.⌋ the printed text has *yāsi*, but  
the comm. *yāti;* ⌊while in the Poona ed. both text and comm. give  
*yāti*⌋.
