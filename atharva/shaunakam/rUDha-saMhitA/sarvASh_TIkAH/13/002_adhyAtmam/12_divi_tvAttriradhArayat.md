### Translation
12. Atri maintained thee in the sky, O sun, to make the month; thou  
goest well-maintained, heating, looking down upon all things that exist.

### Notes
AH our mss. read in **b** *sū́ryā*, as if we had here the compound  
*sūryāmāsá;* the *pada*-mss. have *sū́ryā: mā́sāya;* the correction to  
*sū́rya* seems unavoidable. GB., which has the first two pādas (see note  
to vs. 4), also gives *sūryā-*; Ppp. also has it; and, for **d**, *svar  
bhūtā viśākaśat* ⌊so Roth: perhaps a slip for *vicāk-*⌋.

Atri established thee in heaven. O Surya, to create the month. So on thou goest, firmly held, heating, beholding all that is.
