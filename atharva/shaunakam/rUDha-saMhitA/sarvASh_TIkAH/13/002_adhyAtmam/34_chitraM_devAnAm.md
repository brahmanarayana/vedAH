### Translation
34. Wondrous front \[and\] show (*ketú*) of the gods, the sun, full of  
light, going up the directions (*pradíś*), the day-maker, bright  
(*śukrá*), hath overpassed with brightnesses (*dyumná*) the glooms  
(*támas*) \[and\] all difficulties.

### Notes
This verse and the next are repeated as xx. 107. 13, 14. The definition  
of this one by the Anukr. ⌊as 40 syllables is right from its point of  
view; but the verse⌋ is evidently meant for a *triṣṭubh*, and can easily  
be read into a respectable one, according to the low standard of AV.  
*triṣṭubhs*, by a few judicious resolutions. The harshness and obscurity  
of the constructions in **a, b** are indications of a corrupted text;  
Henry renders *pradíśas* by 'toward the celestial regions,' Ludwig by  
'from the horizon'; the translation above simply adheres to the usual  
sense of the word. Verses 34-36 are directed in Vāit. 39. 16 to be used  
alternatively in the praise of the sun; in 21. 23, the *pratīka*, namely  
*citraṁ devānām* (quoted with vs. 16), might apply either to this verse  
or to the next.

Bright presence of the Gods, the luminous herald Surya hath mounted the celestial regions. Day's maker, he hath shone away the darkness, and radiant, passed o'er places hard to traverse.
