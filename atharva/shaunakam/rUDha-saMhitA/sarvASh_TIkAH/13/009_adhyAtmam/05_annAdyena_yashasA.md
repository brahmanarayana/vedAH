### Translation
56. With food-eating, with glory, with brilliancy, with  
Brahman-splendor.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
These two verses are identical with vss. 48, 49, above ⌊and are  
therefore not defined by the Anukr.⌋.  
  
⌊The quotations from the Old Anukr., given piecemeal for this  
*paryāya-sūkta* at the end of each *paryāya*, may here be given  
together: I. *trayodaśa;* II. *aṣṭāu ca;* III. *tataḥ paraḥ sapta;* IV.  
*saptadaśa;* V. *ṣaṭ ca bodhyāḥ;* VI. *ṣaṣṭaḥ pañcaka ucyate.*—They are  
given by SPP. in his "Critical Notice," vol. i., p. 21, with the  
introductory words, *caturthasyā ’vasānāni vakṣyamāṇāni tāni śṛṇu*.⌋  
  
⌊In *paryāya* V., vss. 47, 50, and 51 have the refrain; and in VI., vss.  
52, 53, and 54 have it: these verses are styled *gaṇāvasānarcaḥ*, and  
the rest *avasānarcaḥ* (as was already noted above, p. 472). But since  
none of the former is divided in two by an *avasāna*-mark, the  
distinction does not affect the sums of the "*ṛcaḥ* of both kinds,"  
which are (as just stated) 3 + 3 for V. and 3 + 2 for VI.⌋  
  
⌊Here ends the fourth *anuvāka*, consisting of 1 *paryāya-sūkta* with 6  
*paryāyas* and 56 verses.⌋  
  
⌊Some mss. reckon up the hymns as 20 (that is 14 of the decad-divisions  
of our hymns 1-3, plus 6 *paryāyas* of our hymn 4) and the verses as  
188.⌋  
  
⌊Here ends the twenty-eighth *prapāṭhaka*.⌋
