### Translation
54. As called one of arising good, of increasing (??) good, of  
gathering good, of coming good, do we worship thee.

### Notes
The translation implies the heroic substitution of *vṛdhádvasu* for the  
wholly senseless *idádvasu*. The Pet. Lexx., to be sure, conjecture for  
the latter the meaning 'rich in this and that' (which Henry follows);  
but, besides the fact that *idát* = *idám* is not less heroic than  
*idát* = *vṛdhát*, the signification given does not belong rightly to  
the compound, nor has it any application here. Our rendering has at  
least concinnity—unless, indeed, in a text of this character, that be an  
argument against its acceptance. All the compounds are evidently  
possessive.
