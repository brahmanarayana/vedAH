### Translation
52. As called wide, broad, happy (*subhū́*), earths (? *bhúvas*), do we  
worship thee.

### Notes
*Bhúvas* is here rendered literally, in the only sense which the word  
has elsewhere in AV. If it is a first appearance of the *vyāhṛti* common  
later, its meaning is wholly obscure in this connection. ⌊Aufrecht, KZ.  
xxxiv. 458, makes some observations about the relations of the  
noun-forms and adjective-forms in vss. 52-53.⌋
