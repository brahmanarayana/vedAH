### Translation
5. The ruddy one hath brought hither thy kingdom; the scorners have  
scattered; fearlessness hath become thine; unto thee, being such, let  
heaven-and-earth, by the *revátīs*, yield (*duh*) here thy desire by the  
*śákvarīs*.

### Notes
Our mss. are divided in **d** between *duhāthām* and *-tām*: the  
majority give *-thām* (so Bs.s.m.Bp.O.D.R.T.K.); while P.M.W.E.p.m. have  
*-tām*; ⌊and so has Ppp.⌋. Kp. reads *āsthat* in **b**, the other  
*pada*-mss. *-an*; if *-at* is accepted, it will mean 'he has scattered  
the scorners'; the form may best be viewed, probably, as coming from  
*sthā*, like *ādat* from *dā* and *ādhat* from *dhā* ⌊see *Skt. Gram.* §  
847⌋; a root *asth* is extremely improbable; ⌊it is discussed at AJP.  
xii. 439 and IF. v. 388, where references to previous discussions are  
given; to these add KZ. xxxii. 435; cf. also note to vii. 76. 3 above⌋.  
The verse occurs also in TB. (ii. 5. 2¹), which has very different  
readings: *ā́hārṣīd rāṣṭrám ihá róhito mṛdho vy asthad ábhayamṁ no astu:  
asmábhyaṁ dyāvāpṛthivī śákvarībhī rāṣṭráṁ duhāthām ihá revátībhiḥ*. The  
verse is no *jagatī;* by the frequent and permissible contraction to  
*-pṛthvī* in **c** it becomes a fairly good *triṣṭubh* (badly  
constructed in **a**). It is reckoned as belonging to the *abhaya gaṇa:*  
see note to Kāuś. 16. 8. ⌊Ppp., like TB., puts *mṛdho* before *vy ā-* in  
**b**.⌋ ⌊For vss. 4-5, see AJP. xii. 432.⌋
