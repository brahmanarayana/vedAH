### Translation
6. The ruddy one generated heaven-and-earth; there the most exalted one  
stretched the line (*tántu*); there was supported (*śri*) the one-footed  
goat (? *ajá*); by strength he made firm (*dṛh*) heaven-and-earth.

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **c** *ekapād yo*. The verse occurs in TB. (ii. 5. 2³),  
with only slight variants: *tásmin* for *tátra* in **b** and **c**, and  
*ékapāt* in **c**. ⌊C£. AJP. xii. 443.⌋

Rohita gave the Earth and Heavens their being. There Para- meshthin held the cord extended. Thereon reposeth Aja Ekapada. He with his might hath stab- lished Earth and Heaven.
