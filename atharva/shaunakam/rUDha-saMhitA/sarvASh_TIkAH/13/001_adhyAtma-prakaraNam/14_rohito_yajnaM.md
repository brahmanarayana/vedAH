### Translation
14. The ruddy one disposed the sacrifice for Viśvakarman; therefrom have  
these brilliancies come unto me; may I speak thy navel (*nā́bhi*) upon  
the range (*majmán*) of existence.

### Notes
The last pāda is repeated below as vs. 37 **d**. Ppp. reads in **a** *vi  
dadhāt*. The metrical definition implies the resolution *ví ad-*, and  
two resolutions in **b** (*-si úpa* and *mā im-*, doubtless), to make a  
*pan̄kti* (14 + 12: 14 = 40).

Rohita ordered sacrifice for Visvakarman: thence have I obta- ined this strength and energy. May I proclaim thee as my kin over the greatness of the world.
