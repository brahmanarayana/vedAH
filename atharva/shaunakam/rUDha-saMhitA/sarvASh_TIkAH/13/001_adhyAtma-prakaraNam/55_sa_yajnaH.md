### Translation
55. That first sacrifice was born \[as\] the one that is, that is to be;  
from that was born this all, whatsoever shines out (*vi-ruc*) here,  
brought (*ā-bhṛ*) by the ruddy one \[as\] seer.

### Notes
Ppp. ends the hymn with this verse, although vs. 58 is found in another  
place. It combines *jajñe ’daṁ*, as we are doubtless to read, though not  
with the sanction of the Anukr., which calls the pāda *bṛhatī*. ⌊Cf. iv.  
23. 7.⌋

This sacrifice, the first of all, the past, the present, had its birth. From that arose this universe, yea, all this world of brightness, brought by Rohita the heavenly Sage.
