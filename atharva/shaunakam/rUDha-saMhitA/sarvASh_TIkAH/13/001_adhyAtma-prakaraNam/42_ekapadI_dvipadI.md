### Translation
42. One-footed, two-footed \[is\] she, four-footed; having become  
eight-footed, nine-footed, thousand-syllabled, a series of existence;  
out from her flow apart the oceans.

### Notes
This verse is the pādas **b-e** of ix. 10. 21 (RV. i. 164. 41 **b-d**,  
42 **a**) ⌊see under ix. 10. 21 for variants⌋. It and the preceding are  
very little in place in our hymn. ⌊With **d** cf. 3. 2 **b**, below.⌋
