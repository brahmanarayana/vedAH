### Translation
60. What line, accomplisher of the sacrifice, is stretched clear to the  
gods, that, sacrificed unto, may we attain.

### Notes
The verse is RV. x. 57. 2, which reads at the end *naśīmahi*. It is used  
by the schol. to Kāuś. 58. 17, with vs. 59, in the ceremony of  
name-giving.  
  
⌊Here ends the first *anuvāka*, 1 hymn and 60 verses. The quoted Anukr.  
says *ṣaṣṭiḥ*.⌋
