### Translation
7. The ruddy one made firm heaven-and-earth; by him was established the  
sky (*svàr*), by him the firmament (*nā́ka*); by him the atmosphere, the  
spaces (*rájas*) were measured out; by him the gods discovered  
immortality (*amṛ́ta*).

### Notes
The verse is found in TB. (ib.), the second half-verse reading quite  
differently: *só antárikṣe rájaso vimā́nas téna devā́ḥ súvar ánv avindan*.  
Ppp. combines and reads in **d** *devā ’mṛtatvam*.

Rohita firmly stablished Earth and Heaven: by him was ether fixt by him the welkin. He measured out mid air and all the regions: by him the Gods found life that lasts for ever.
