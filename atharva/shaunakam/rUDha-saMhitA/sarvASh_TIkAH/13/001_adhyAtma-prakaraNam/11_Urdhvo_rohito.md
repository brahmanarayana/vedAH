### Translation
11. The ruddy one hath stood aloft upon the firmament (*nā́kā*),  
generating all forms, \[he,\] young, poet; Agni shineth forth with keen  
light; in the third space (*rájas*) he hath done dear things.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *bhāsi* in **c**. The Anukr. again passes without notice the  
*jagatī* pāda **b**. ⌊W. suggests by interlineation as alternative,  
'hath made for himself dear forms.'⌋

Erected, Rohita hath reached the welkin, wise, young, creating every form and figure. Agni, refulgent with his heightened lustre, in the third realm hath brought us joy and gladness.
