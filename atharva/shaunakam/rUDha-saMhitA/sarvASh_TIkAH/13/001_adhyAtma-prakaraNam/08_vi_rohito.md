### Translation
8. The ruddy one examined (*vi-mṛś*) the all-formed, collecting to  
himself the fore-ascents and the ascents; having ascended the sky with  
great greatness, let him anoint (*sam-añj*) thy kingdom with milk, with  
ghee.

### Notes
The TB. version (ii. 5. 2²) has, for **a**, *ví mamarśa róhito  
viśvárūpaḥ;* in **b**, *samācakrāṇáḥ;* in **c**, *gatvā́ya* (for *rūḍhvā́*  
⌊improving the meter⌋); for **d**, *ví no rāṣṭrám unattu páyasā svéna*.  
Ppp. combines in **a** *-to ‘mṛśat*, and reads in **b** *samākṛṇvānaṣ*.

Arranging shoots, springs, Rohita considered this Universe in all its forms and phases. May he, gone up to heaven with mighty glory, anoint thy sov- ranty with milk and fatness.
