### Translation
19. O lord of speech, \[generate\] well-willing and mind; generate kine  
in our stall (*goṣṭhá*), progeny in our wombs (*yóni*); just here be  
breath in our companionship; thee here, O most exalted one, I surround  
with life-time, with honor.

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **b** *prajām*, and in **d** *avahaṁ* (for *aham*),  
omitting, as before, *āyuṣā*, ⌊and having again *dadhātu* at the end,  
repeated unintelligently from the preceding⌋.

Breed, O Vachaspati, joy and understanding, kine i n our stall and children in our consorts. Even here may Prana be our friend: may Agni, O Parameshthin, give thee life and splendour.
