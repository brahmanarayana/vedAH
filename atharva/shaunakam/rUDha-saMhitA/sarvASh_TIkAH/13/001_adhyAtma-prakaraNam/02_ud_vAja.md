### Translation
2. Up hath arisen the power (? *vā́ja*) that is within the waters; mount  
(*ā-ruh*) thou the clans (*víś*) that are sprung from thee (*tvádyoni*);  
assuming (*dhā*) the soma, the waters, the herbs, the kine, make thou  
the four-footed, the two-footed ones to enter here.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
In **b** begins the play of words upon the root *ruh* 'ascend, mount,  
grow,' and its compounds and derivatives; this play is suggested by the  
at least apparent relationship between *ruh* and *rohita*, ⌊and is found  
with considerable elaboration throughout⌋ these hymns. Here it doubtless  
signifies 'have supremacy over.' Ppp. combines in **b** *viśā ”roha*, in  
**c** *dadhāna ’po ’ṣadh-*, and in **d** *dvipadā ’veś-*; and this last  
we have to accept in order to make a *triṣṭubh* pāda. In **a** the  
resolution of *ā́ agan*, and in **b** that of *tuád-*, make the meter  
right. The Anukr. takes no notice of any irregularity in the verse.

The strength that was in waters hath ascended. Mount o'er the tribes which thou hast generated. Creating Soma, waters, plants and cattle, bring hitherward both quadrupeds and bipeds.
