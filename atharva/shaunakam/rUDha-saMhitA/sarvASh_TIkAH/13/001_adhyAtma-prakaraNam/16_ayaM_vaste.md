### Translation
16. This one clothes himself in the embryo (womb?) of the earth; this  
one clothes himself in the sky, the atmosphere; this one, on the summit  
of the reddish one, has penetrated the heaven (*svàr*), the worlds.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *viṣṭapas sv-* in **c-d**, and *sam ānaśe* in **d**. The  
verse (9 + 9: 8 + 8 = 34) seems to be overlooked in the Anukr., or its  
definition has dropped out of the mss. Verses 16-20 are prescribed in  
Kāuś. 54. 10 to accompany, in the *godāna*-ceremony, the dressing of the  
child in a new garment. They are much better suited to that use than to  
their surroundings here.

He goes into the womb of earth, he robes himself in heaven and air. He on the Bright One's station hath reached heavenly light and all the worlds.
