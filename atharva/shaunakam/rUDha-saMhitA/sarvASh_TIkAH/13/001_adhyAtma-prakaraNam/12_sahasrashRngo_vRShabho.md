### Translation
12. The thousand-horned bull Jātavedas, offered to with ghee,  
soma-backed, having good heroes—let him not abandon me; let me not, a  
suppliant, abandon thee\*; assign thou to me both prosperity in kine  
and prosperity in heroes.

### Notes
The verse is found also in TB. (iii. 7. 2⁷), K. (xxxv. 18), and Āp. ⌊ix.  
3. 1⌋. TB. (with which Āp. ⌊substantially⌋ agrees throughout) has, for  
**b**, *stómapṛṣṭho ghṛtávānt suprátīkaḥ;* and, for **c, d,** *mā́ no  
hāsīn metthitó nét tvā jáhāma gopoṣáṁ no vīrapoṣáṁ ca yaccha*. Ppp.  
reads in **b** *ghṛtāhutis so-*. The irregular verse (12 + 11: 12 + 12,  
but with *triṣṭubh* cadences throughout) is very ill described by the  
Anukr. as simply a jagatī. \*⌊All the translators, with W., seem to  
overlook the accent oi *jáhāni: nét* can hardly mean aught else than  
'lest.'⌋

Thousand-horned Bull, may Jatavedas, worshipped with butter, balmed with Soma, rich in heroes, Besought, ne'er quit me; may I ne'er forsake thee. Give me abundant men and herds of cattle.
