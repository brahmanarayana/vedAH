### Translation
34. Both ascend thou to heaven and ascend to earth; both ascend to

immortality; make thyself contiguous with the ruddy one.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The verse is quoted in Vāit. 13. 5 to accompany the leading up of the

Rise up to earth, rise up to heaven above it; rise up to opulence, rise up to kingship. Rise up to offspring, rise to life immortal; rise, and with Rohita unite thy body.
