### Translation
36. Sacrifices purified by *bráhman* carry thee up; yellow (*hári*)  
roadsters draw (*vah*) thee; thou shinest over (*ati-ruc*) across the  
ocean, the sea.

### Notes
The verse might better be called *virāj* than *nicṛt* (11 + 11: 12).  
Ppp. reads in **b** *abhyaktuṁ* (for *adhvagato*); and in **c** *-se  
arṇavam*, as do some of our mss. (O.R.T.K.). ⌊Pādas **a** and **b**  
recur below, vs. 43.⌋

Cleansed by prayer, sacrifices bear thee upward: bay coursers, ever travelling, convey thee. Thy light shines over sea and billowy ocean.
