### Translation
35. The kingdom-bearing gods who go to surround (*abhítas*) the sun—in  
concord with them let the ruddy one, with favoring mind, assign kingdom  
to thee.

### Notes
The combination *tāíṣ ṭe* is quoted as example under Prāt. ii. 84. The  
verse (7 + 8: 9 + 11: or 8 in **a**, if we resolve *deva-ā́* or  
*rāṣṭṛ-a-*) is far too irregular to be defined simply as an  
*upariṣṭādbṛhatī*.
