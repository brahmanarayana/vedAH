### Translation
32. Do thou, O heavenly sun, arising, smite down my rivals; smite them  
down with the stone; let them go to lowest darkness.

### Notes
Ppp. appears to read *avāi ’nāṁ raśmibhir jahi rātrīṇāṁ tantasā vadhīs  
taṁ hantv adhamaṁ tamaḥ*. ⌊We had our **d** at x. 3. 9 **d**.⌋

Ascending up on high, O God. O Surya, drive my foes away. Yea, beat them backward with the stone: to deepest darkness let them go.
