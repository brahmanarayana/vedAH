### Translation
10. What clans (*víś*) of thine came into being out of ardor (*tápas*),  
those have come hither after the young (*vatsá*), the *gāyatrī́;* let  
them enter (*ā-viś*) into thee with propitious mind; let the ruddy young  
with its mother go against \[them\].

### Notes
Or (in **a**) 'what clans came into being out of thy heat.' In **b**,  
the *pada*-text has *ihá: ā́: aguḥ*. In **d**, *sámmātā* means more  
probably 'having a common mother,' but the sense is too obscure to allow  
of much confidence in any translation. The TB. version (ii. 5. 2²) reads  
in **a** *tápasā* (better); for **b**, *gāyatráṁ vatsám ánu tā́s ta ā́  
’guḥ;* in **c**, *máhasā svéna;* in **d**, *putró* (for *vatsó*). The  
Anukr. does not heed that the last pāda is *jagatī*. Ppp. combines in  
**d** *vatso ‘bhy*.

The tribes thy heat produced have followed hither the Calf and Gayatri, the strain that lauds him. With friendly heart let them approach to serve thee, and the Calf Rohita come with his mother.
