### Translation
9. What ascents, fore-ascents thou hast, what on-ascents (*ārúh*) thou  
hast, with which thou fillest the sky, the atmosphere, with the  
*bráhman*, with the milk of them increasing, do thou watch over the  
people (*víś*) in the kingdom of the ruddy one.

### Notes
Though the first three pādas count 12 syllables each, only **a** is  
jagatī in structure. With **a, b** compare xviii. 2. 9 **a, b**. ⌊For  
vss. 8-9, see AJP. xii. 433.⌋

Thy risings up, thy mountings and ascensions wherewith thou fillest heaven and air's mid-region-- By prayer for these, by milk of these, increasing, in Rohita's kingdom watch, among his people.
