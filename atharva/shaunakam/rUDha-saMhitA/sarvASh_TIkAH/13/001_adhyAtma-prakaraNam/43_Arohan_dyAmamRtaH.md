### Translation
43. Mounting the sky, immortal, do thou favor my words; sacrifices  
purified by *bráhman* carry thee up; yellow roadsters draw thee.

### Notes
Pādas **b** and **c** are identical with 36 **a, b**. Instead of  
*adhvagatas*, Ppp. reads *ghṛtaṁ pibantaṁ.* Bp. accents *prá: áva*.

Rising to heaven, immortal, hear my calling. Cleansed by prayer, sacrifices bear thee upward. Bay coursers, ever on the road, convey thee.
