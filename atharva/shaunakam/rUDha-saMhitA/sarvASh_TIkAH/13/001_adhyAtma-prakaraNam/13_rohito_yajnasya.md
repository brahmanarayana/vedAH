### Translation
13. The ruddy one is generator and mouth of the sacrifice; to the ruddy  
one I make oblation with speech, with hearing, with mind; to the ruddy  
one go the gods with favoring mind; let him cause me to ascend with  
ascensions (*róha*) of meeting (*sāmityá*).

### Notes
The *pada*-texts read blunderingly in **d** *sām॰aityāí* (instead of  
*-yāíḥ*). Henry emends to *samityāí* 'in order to union with him'; but  
*sámiti* has the well-established sense of 'meeting, gathering,  
assembly'; hence Ludwig (for *rohāiḥ s-*) 'with abundant success in the  
*samiti*.' ⌊See AJP. xii. 434.⌋ Ppp. reads at the end *rohayāti*. The  
verse is kindred with ii. 35. 5 in general expression. Its metrical  
structure (12 + 15: 13 + 11 = 51) is wholly irregular; the definition of  
the Anukr. ⌊52 syllables⌋ ⌊nearly⌋ fits it mechanically.

Rohita is the sire and mouth of worship: to him with voice, ear, heart I pay oblation. To Rohita come Gods with joyful spirit. May he by risings raise me till I join him.
