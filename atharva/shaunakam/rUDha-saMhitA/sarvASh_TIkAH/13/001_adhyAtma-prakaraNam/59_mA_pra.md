### Translation
59. Let us not go forth from the road, nor, O Indra, from the sacrifice  
with soma; let not the niggards stand between us.

### Notes
That is, between us and something else, so as to cut us off from our  
desire or object. The verse is, without variant, RV. x. 57. 1, and found  
also in JB. iii. 168. It is used once in Vāit. (18. 8), and several  
times in Kāuś. (54. 18; 82. 6; 89. 11; also by the schol. under 42. 15;  
58. 17).

Let us not, Indra, leave the path, the Soma-presser's sacrifice. Let not malignities dwell with us.
