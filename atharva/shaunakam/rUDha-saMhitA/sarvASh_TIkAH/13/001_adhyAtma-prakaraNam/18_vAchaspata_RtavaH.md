### Translation
18. O lord of speech, the five seasons that are ours, that came forth  
into being as Viśvakarman's—just here be breath in our companionship;  
thee here, O most exalted one, let the ruddy one surround with  
life-time, with honor.

### Notes
The mss. read in **a** *yé nāu* (but I.R. *yó nāu* ⌊yónāu⌋); ⌊SPP's text  
and most of his authorities have *yé nāu:* but two have *yónāu;*⌋ the  
edition makes the apparently necessary correction to *yé no*. ⌊The  
Anukr. seems to scan as 11 + 12: 10 + 14 + 6 = 53.⌋ Ppp. omits *ye nāu*  
(or *no*) in **a**, and *sam-* in **b**, and *āyuṣā* near the end.

And those, Vachaspati, our own five seasons, sacred to Visva- karman their creator. Even here our friend be Prana: Parameshthin, may Rohita vouchsafe the life and splendour.
