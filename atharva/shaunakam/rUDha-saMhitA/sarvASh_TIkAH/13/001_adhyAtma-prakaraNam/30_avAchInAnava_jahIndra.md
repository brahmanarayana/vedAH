### Translation
30. Do thou, O Indra, having arms, smite them down downward with the  
thunderbolt; then my rivals have I taken to myself with Agni's  
brightnesses (*téjas*).

### Notes
Ppp. puts the verse after our 31, and reads at the end *ā dadhe*. ⌊Or  
*ā́diṣi* may be referred to *dā* 'cut' + *ā:* so W. in a ms. note to his  
*Index*, and so BR. But BR's forms from vi. 104 are referred by W. to  
*dā* 'tie.'⌋

Beat them down, Indra, with thy bolt, beat them down, mighty with thine arm. I through the energy and force of Agni have secured my foes.
