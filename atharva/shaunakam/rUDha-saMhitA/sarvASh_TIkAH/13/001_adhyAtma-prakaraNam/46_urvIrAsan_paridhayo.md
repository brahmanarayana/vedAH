### Translation
46. The wide ones (*urvī́*) were the enclosures; the earth took shape as  
sacrificial hearth; there the ruddy one set (*ā-dhā*) these two fires,  
cold and heat.

The earth was made his altar, and the wide expanses were the fence. There Rohita established both these Agnis, fervent heat and cold.
