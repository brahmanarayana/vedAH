### Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xviii. ⌊with vs. 30 after 31; vss. 56-57, 59-60 are lacking; vs. 58 is lacking in Pāipp. xviii., but is found in Pāipp. xx.⌋. A number of the verses are used in various parts of Kāuś., and several (four) in Vāit. *⌊So the Berlin ms. (against jagatī of the London ms.): and atijagatī more nearly fits the vs.⌋ †⌊Here the Anukr. text looks as if in disorder: it seems as if yaṁ vāta (vs. 51) iti ṣaḍ anuṣṭubhaḥ ought to refer to the 6 vss. 51, 53-54, 56-58.⌋


### Translations
Translated: Muir, v. 395 (parts); Ludwig, p. 536; Scherman, p. 73 (parts); Henry, 1, 21; Deussen, Geschichte, i. 1. 218 (cf. his introduction, p. 212 ff.); Griffith, ii. 133; Bloomfield, 207, 661.—Furthermore, Bloomfield, in his review (AJP. xii. 429-443) of Henry, discusses a considerable number of passages from this hymn. These discussions will be briefly cited by reference to "AJP. xii." He considers that the hymn is secondarily "an allegorical exaltation of a king and his queen."
