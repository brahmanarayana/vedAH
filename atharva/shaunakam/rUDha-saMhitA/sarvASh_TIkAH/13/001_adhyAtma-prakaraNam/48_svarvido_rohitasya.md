### Translation
48. The fire of the sky-finding ruddy one is kindled with *bráhman;*  
therefrom heat, therefrom cold, therefrom the sacrifice was born.

### Notes
The majority of mss. read correctly *yajñò ’jāy-* at the end; the rest  
vary between *-ñó aj-* and *-ñò aj-*. Ppp. reads *-ño aj-*; and, in  
**b**, *samāhitah* for *sam idhyate*.

Rohita's Agni-his who found heaven's light-is kindled with the prayer. From him the heat, from him the cold, from him the sacrifice was born.
