### Translation
47. Having set cold and heat, having made the mountains sacrificial  
posts (*yū́pa*), having rain as sacrificial butter, the two fires of the  
sky-finding ruddy one performed sacrifice (*yaj*).

### Notes
The Anukr. appears to ratify the resolution *kṛtu-ā́* in **b**. Ppp., in  
this verse as later, combines *agnī ”jāte*. ⌊For 46, Hillebrandt, *Ved.  
Mythol.* i. 179, cites śB. i. 2. 5⁷.⌋
