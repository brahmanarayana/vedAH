### Translation
28. Agni, kindled, being kindled, increased with ghee, offered to with  
ghee—let the overpowering, all-overpowering Agni slay them who are my  
rivals.

### Notes
This verse (though there are others having the same *pratīka*) is  
doubtless the one quoted (next after vs. 1) in Kāuś. 49. 19, to  
accompany the laying of bonds upon the "boat" there treated of; ⌊rather,  
the laying of sticks with strings on them upon the fire: Caland, p.  
173⌋. The description of the Anukr. strangely forbids us to make the  
elision *-dho ‘gníḥ* in **a**.

Both kindling and inflamed, adored with butter and enhanced thereby. May conquering Agni, conqueror of all, destroy mine enemies.
