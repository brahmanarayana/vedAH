### Translation
57. Thou that goest past me shading me, and between me and the fire, I  
hew off thy root; thou shalt not further cast shadow.

### Notes
The connection appears to demand this pregnant rendering of *abhichāyám*  
'so as to cast thy shadow on' (so also Ludwig). It is easy to read **b**  
as a regular *anuṣṭubh* pāda, though the Anukr. allows it only six  
syllables.

Thou who, between the fire and me, passest across the line of shade. Thy root I sever: nevermore mayst thou cast shadow on the ground.
