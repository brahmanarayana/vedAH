### Translation
17. O lord of speech, \[be\] earth pleasant to us; \[be\] the lair  
(*yóni*) pleasant, \[be\] our couch very propitious; just here be breath  
in our companionship; thee here, O most exalted one, let Agni surround  
with life-time, with honor.

### Notes
Henry understands *sakhyé* as dat. of *sákhi*, against the accent. The  
Anukr. apparently views the verse as ⌊10 + 10: 10 + 12 + 6 = 48⌋. The  
verse (with the two following?) is included among the *vācaspatilin̄gās*,  
used in Kāuś. 41. 15 in a ceremony for good luck. Ppp. reads at the end  
*-ṣṭhi pary ahaṁ varcasā dadhāmi*.

To us, Vachaspati, may Earth be pleasant, pleasant our dwelling, pleasant be our couches. Even here may Prana be our friend: may Agni, O Parameshthin give thee life and splendour.
