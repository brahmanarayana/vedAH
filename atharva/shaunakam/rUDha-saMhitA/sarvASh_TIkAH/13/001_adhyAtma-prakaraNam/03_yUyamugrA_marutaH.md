### Translation
3. Do ye \[who are\] formidable, O Maruts, sons of the spotted mother,  
with Indra as ally, slaughter our foes; the ruddy one shall listen to  
you, ye liberal ones (*sudā́nu*), ye thrice seven Maruts that enjoy  
sweets together.

### Notes
The first half-verse occurred above as v. 21. 11 **a, b**. We can hardly  
help emending *triṣaptā́so* to *tríṣaptāso*. Ppp. reads instead  
*triṣaptā*. The verse is found also in TB. (ii. 5. 2³), which reads in  
**a** *ugrā* (which is better), in **b** *sayújā prá ṇī́tha* (corrupt),  
in **c** *aśṛṇod abhidyavaḥ*, and in **d** (with the desired accent)  
*trísaptāso*. The verse lacks a syllable (in **b**) of being a proper  
*jagatī*.
