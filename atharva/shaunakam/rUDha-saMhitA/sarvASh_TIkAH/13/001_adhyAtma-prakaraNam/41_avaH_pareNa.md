### Translation
41. Below the distant, thus beyond the lower, bearing her calf with her  
foot, the cow hath stood up; whitherwards, to what quarter, hath she  
forsooth gone away? where giveth she birth? for \[it is\] not in this  
herd.

### Notes
This is a repetition of ix. 9. 17, and, as there are two successive  
verses beginning with *aváḥ páreṇa*, this one is quoted here in the mss.  
with the unusual expression *aváh* *páreṇé ’d pū́rvā*. ⌊The Anukr.  
doubtless balances the extra syllable in **a** by counting *kúa* as one  
syllable in **d**.⌋
