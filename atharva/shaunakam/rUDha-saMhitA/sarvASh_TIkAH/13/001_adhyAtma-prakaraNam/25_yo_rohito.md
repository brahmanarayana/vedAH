### Translation
25. The ruddy one, the sharp-horned bull, who encompassed Agni, the sun,  
who props asunder (*vi-stabh*) the earth and the heaven—out of him do  
the gods create creations.

### Notes
Ppp. begins with *ayaṁ roh-*. The curious reading of O. in **c**,  
*ṣṭab-h-nāti* (the *b* and *h* two different letters), was noted above,  
under xii. 4. 4. ⌊"Encompassed": Bloomfield, "became superior to," AJP.  
xii. 443.⌋ Kāuś. 18. 25 gives the verse, in company with several others,  
as to be used in the so-called *citrākarman* (ceremony concerning the  
asterism *citrā*) to accompany the partaking of a milk rice-dish; and  
the Paddhati includes both it and the following verse in the *salila  
gaṇa*.
