### Translation
21. Thou whom the spotted one (f.), the side-horse, draws (*vah*) in the  
chariot, O ruddy one, thou goest with brightness (*śúbh*), making flow  
the waters.

### Notes
This verse corresponds to RV. viii. 7. 28, which, however, has  
considerable variants: for **a**, *yád eṣām pṛ́ṣatī* (p. *-tīḥ*) *ráthe;*  
in **b**, *róhitaḥ;* in **c**, *yā́nti śubhrā́* (p. *-rā́ḥ*). As is usual  
in such cases, some of our mss. read *pṛ́ṣṭis* in **b**, and *ṛṇán* in  
**c**. And most read *rohitaḥ* ⌊unaccented⌋ at end of **b** (only  
Bs.R.K. *-ta*), as if under influence of the RV. version. ⌊SPP. adopts  
in his text *rohita*, but reports six of his mss. as giving *rohitaḥ*,  
without accent.⌋ Ppp. adds at the end *tene ’maṁ brahmaṇaspate ruhaṁ  
rohayo ’ttamam*. The verse is quoted in a ceremony for prosperity' by  
Kāuś. (24. 42), which volunteers the added explanation *dyāuḥ pṛṣaty  
ādityo rohitaḥ;* and it is also included among the *puṣṭika mantras:*  
see note to Kāuś. 19. 1. Kāuś. 24. 43 states further that a spotted cow  
is given (as sacrificial fee); and the comm. appears to direct that vss.  
21-26 accompany the gift.
