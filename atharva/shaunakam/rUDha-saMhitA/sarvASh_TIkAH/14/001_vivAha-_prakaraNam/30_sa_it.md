### Translation
30. That priest verily takes this garment, pleasant, well-omened, who  
goes over the expiation, by whom the wife takes no harm.

### Notes
The *pada*-text reads *prā́yaścittim*, undivided; if we had *-ttam*,  
*yéna* would apply to it, instead of to *brahmā́*. Ppp. reads, for **a,  
b**: *sa vāi taṁ syono harati brahma vāsas suman̄galan*.

The Brahman takes away the robe as a fair thing that brings good luck. He knows the expiating rite whereby the wife is kept unharmed.
