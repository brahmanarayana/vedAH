### Translation
63. Injure ye not the maiden (*kumārī́*), ye (two) pillars, on the  
god-made road; the door of the divine house we make pleasant, a road for  
the bride.

### Notes
Or, 'we make a pleasant road' etc. In Kāuś. 77. 20, the verses 2. 26; 1.  
21, 63, 64, in this order, are used to accompany the bride's stepping  
forward into the house. ⌊Cf. Wint., p. 72, top.⌋
