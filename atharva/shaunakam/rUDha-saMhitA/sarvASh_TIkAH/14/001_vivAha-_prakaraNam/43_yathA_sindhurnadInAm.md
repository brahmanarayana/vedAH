### Translation
43. As the ⌊mighty (? *vṛ́ṣā*)⌋ river (*síndhu*) won (? *sū*) the  
supremacy of the streams (*nadī́*), so be thou supreme (*samrā́jñī*),  
having gone away to thy husband's home.

### Notes
Perhaps *síndhu* should be rendered 'Indus' (so Zimmer, p. 317; Weber,  
p. 199). *Suṣuve*, lit. 'impelled for one's self,' is employed here in  
an unusual sen.se; the word is quoted as example under Prāt. ii. 91; iv.  
82. Ppp. reads *sūṣuve vṛkāt*. By Kāuś. 75. 27, the verse accompanies  
the emergence of the bride from the bath (with vs. 35, above).

As vigorous Sindhu won himself imperial lordship of the streams, So be imperial queen when thou hast come within thy husband's home.
