### Translation
33. May ye, O kine, enter this man together with progeny; this man  
minisheth (*mī*) not the share of the gods; for this man shall Pūshan,  
and all the Maruts, for this man shall Dhātar, Savitar quicken (*sū*)  
you.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *viśadhvam* at end of **a**. This verse indicates distinctly  
that the preceding one is meant as a wish for prosperity in respect to  
kine.

Come, O ye Cows, with offspring dwell around him: he doth not stint the Gods' alloted portion. To him, your friend, may Pushan, all the Maruts, to him may Dhatar, Savitar send vigour.
