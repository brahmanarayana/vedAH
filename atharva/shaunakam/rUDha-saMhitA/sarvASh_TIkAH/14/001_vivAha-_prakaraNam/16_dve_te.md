### Translation
16. The two wheels of thee, O Sūryā, the priests (*brahmán*) know  
seasonably; further, the one wheel that is in secret—that, verily, the  
enlightened (*addhātí*) know.

### Notes
Is RV. x. 85. 16. All our mss. accent in **a** *sū́rye* and in **d** ⌊all  
save D.⌋ *vidúḥ;* our edition corrects both words to accordance with RV.  
Close correspondence with RV. x. 85 ceases with vs. 16, at the end of  
the Sūryā-hymn proper. ⌊SPP. reads *sū́rye* with all his authorities, and  
*vidúḥ* with nearly all. He adds: "the correction to *viduḥ* is not  
inevitable." But I do not see how the accented form is to be rendered.⌋

Two wheels of thine the Brahmans know, Surya! according to their times. That which is hidden only those who know the highest truths have learned.
