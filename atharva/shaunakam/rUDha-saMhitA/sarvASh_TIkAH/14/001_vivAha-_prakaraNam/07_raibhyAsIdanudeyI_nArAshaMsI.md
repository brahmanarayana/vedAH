### Translation
7. The *rāíbhī* was the parting \[song\] (?? *anudéyī*), the *nārāśaṅsī́*  
was the welcoming one (? *nyócanī*); Sūryā's garment verily was  
excellent; she goes adorned with song (*gā́thā*).

### Notes
Is RV. x. 85. 6, which reads at the end *páriṣkṛtam* (p. *pári॰kṛtam*)  
for *páriṣkṛtā* (which our p. and s. both have). The translation given  
ventures new conjectures for *anudéyī* (lit. 'to be given after') and  
*nyócanī* (lit. 'making wonted or at home'); the Pet. Lexx. say 'dowry'  
⌊so BR. iii. 569, OB. i. 52: but cf. BR. i. 205 and v. 987⌋ and  
'ornament'; Ludwig 'vom Hause mitgegeben' and '\[ins neue Haus\]  
einführend'; Weber, 'train' and 'hand-maid.'
