### Translation
55. Brihaspati first prepared (*kḷp*) the hairs on the head of Sūryā;  
with this, O Aśvins, do we thoroughly adorn (*śubh*) this woman for her  
husband.

### Notes
It looks as if *prathamás* were an intrusion in **a**. ⌊in **c**, Ppp.  
has for a third time *nāryaṁ*.⌋ In Kāuś. 79. 14 the verse is made to  
accompany the parting of the bride's hair with a blade of  
*darbha*-grass; according to the *paddhati*, this verse and the next are  
used together for the purpose.
