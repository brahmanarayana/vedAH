### Translation
41. In the hole of the chariot, in the hole of the cart, in the hole of  
the yoke, O thou of a hundred activities, having thrice purified Apālā,  
O Indra, thou didst make her sun-skinned.

### Notes
The verse is RV. viii. 80 (91). 7, which has for sole variant *pūtvī́* in  
**c**. Prāt. ii. 64 prescribes the combination *triṣ p-*, but part of  
our mss. (O.R.K.) read *triḥ*. The Āpast. version (Wint., p. 43 ⌊MP. i.  
1. 9⌋) is quite corrupt. ⌊Cf. MGS. i. 8. 11 and p. 149.⌋ In Ppp. the  
verse is not found among the marriage verses, but in book iv., ⌊and  
without variant⌋. ⌊For a careful treatment of the Apālā story, see H.  
Oertel, in JAOS. xviii.¹ 26.⌋ ⌊The MP. version of this verse furnishes  
Böhtlingk occasion for some interesting general critical remarks,  
*Berichte der sächsischen Gesellschaft*, Feb. 5, 1898, p. 4.⌋
