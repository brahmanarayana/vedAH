### Translation
51. Bhaga hath grasped thy hand; Savitar hath grasped thy hand; thou art  
\[my\] spouse by ordinance (*dhárman*), I thy house-lord.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *dhātā* for *bhagas* in **a**, inserts *te* before *hastam*  
in **b**, and adds after **b** two pādas: *bhagas te h. a.* and *aryamā  
te h. a.*, ⌊then finishing with our **c, d**⌋. One of the subsidiary  
treatises (see note to Kāuś. 76. 10) substitutes the verse for vs. 20  
above (see note there).
