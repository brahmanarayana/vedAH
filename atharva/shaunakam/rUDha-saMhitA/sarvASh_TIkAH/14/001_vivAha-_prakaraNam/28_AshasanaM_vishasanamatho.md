### Translation
28. Carving on, carving open, also cutting over apart; see the forms of  
Sūryā; them also the priest (*brahmán*) cleans (*śumbh*).

### Notes
RV. (x. 85. 35) reads at the end *tú śundhati* ⌊cf. BR. vii. 261, top⌋.  
Weber ⌊p. 190⌋ sees in the verse a comparison of the blood on the  
bride's garment with that from the sacrificial victim when dismembered,  
the priest having power to cleanse both stains away.
