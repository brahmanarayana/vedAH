### Translation
22. Be ye (two) just here; be not separated; attain your whole lifetime,  
sporting with sons \[and\] grandsons, rejoicing, well-homed.

### Notes
RV. (x. 85. 42) reads *své gṛhé* instead of *svastakāú*, and Ppp. has  
the same. Ppp. also has *dīrgham* for *viśvam* in **b**. ⌊Cf. MP. 1. 8.  
8 and note.⌋
