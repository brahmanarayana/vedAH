### Translation
35. Both what splendor is placed in dice, and what in strong drink—what  
splendor, O Aśvins, is in kine, with that splendor favor (*av*) ye this  
woman.

### Notes
All our mss. accent *aśvínā* in **c**; our edition makes the necessary  
correction to *aśvinā*. ⌊SPP. adopts and defends the reading *aśvínā*.⌋  
Ppp. puts the verse after our vs. 36. The Anukr. does not heed that the  
first pāda lacks a syllable. According to Kāuś. 75. 27, this verse, with  
43 below, is used in connection with pouring of water on the bride; and  
again, in 139. 15, this and the next, with several others from different  
books, accompany a libation ⌊in the fire⌋ in the ceremony of initiation  
into Vedic study; both also (35, 36) are reckoned as belonging to the  
*varcasya gaṇa* (see note to Kāuś. 13. 1). ⌊Cf. ix. 1. 18; vi. 69. 1.⌋
