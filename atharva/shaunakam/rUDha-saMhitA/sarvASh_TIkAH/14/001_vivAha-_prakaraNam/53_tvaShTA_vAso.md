### Translation
53. Tvashṭar disposed (*vi-dhā*) the garment for beauty, by direction  
of Brihaspati, of the poets; therewith let Savitar and Bhaga envelop  
this woman, like Sūryā, with progeny.

### Notes
In Kāuś. 76. 4, this verse is used with vs. 45, above ⌊which see⌋, with  
dressing the bride in a new garment ⌊cf. Wint., p. 47⌋; and the same is  
repeated in Kāuś. 79. 13 at another point in the ceremonies. The full  
number of syllables is to be obtained in **b** only by a harsh  
resolution. Ppp. has in **c** *nāryaṁ* ⌊cf. note to vs. 59⌋, and at the  
end the decidedly better reading *prajāyāi*.
