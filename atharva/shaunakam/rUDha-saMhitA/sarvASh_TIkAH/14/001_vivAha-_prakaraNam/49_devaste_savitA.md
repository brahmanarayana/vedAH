### Translation
49. Let god Savitar grasp thy hand; let king Soma make thee to have good  
offspring; let Agni, Jātavedas, make the spouse well-portioned,  
long-lived, for her husband.

### Notes
Ppp. has this verse next after our vs. 47, by removing ⌊as noted⌋ 48 to  
after 50. The Anukr. takes no notice of the deficiency of two syllables  
in **c**.
