### Translation
5. Guarded by covering-arrangements, defended by watchmen (??  
*bárhata*), O Soma, thou standest hearing the pressing-stones; no  
earthly one partakes of thee.

### Notes
Is RV. X. 85. 4, without variant. All this talk about the moon as  
identical with Soma at the beginning of the *Sūryā*-hymn seems very  
meaningless unless Sūryā is really the moon, who every month "goes to"  
her spouse the sun.

Soma, preserved by covering rules, guarded by hymns in Brihati, Thou standest listening to the stones; none tastes of thee who dwells on earth.
