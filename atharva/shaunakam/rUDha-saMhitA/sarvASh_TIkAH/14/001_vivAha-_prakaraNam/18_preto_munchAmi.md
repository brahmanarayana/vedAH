### Translation
18. I release \[her\] from here, not from yonder; I make her well-bound  
yonder, that she, O gracious Indra, may be rich in sons, well-portioned.

### Notes
Is RV. x. 85. 25, without variant ⌊save that our text does not give  
*muñcāmi* the antithetical accent⌋. Prāt. ii. 65 teaches the combination  
*-tas karam*. Ppp. begins *pre ’to muñcata mā ’mutah*. The *mantrapāṭha*  
⌊MP. i. 4. 5⌋ of the Āpastamba Gṛhya-Sūtra (see Winternitz, *Altind.  
Hochzeitsrituell* etc., p. 54) has a varying version, reading in **a**  
*muñcā́ti mā́* ⌊Oxford text *ná*⌋, and in **b** *karat*.

Hence and not thence I send her free. I make her softly fettered there. That, bounteous Indra! she may live blest in her fortune and her sons.
