### Translation
60. Bhaga fashioned the four feet; Bhaga fashioned the four frame-pieces  
(? *úṣyala*); Tvashṭar adorned (*piś*) the straps (? *várdhra*) along in  
the middle; let her be to us of excellent omen.

### Notes
Kāuś. uses the verse not only as stated in the preceding note, but also  
(76. 25), more properly, with 2. 31, when the bride mounts the couch  
(*talpa*). Ppp. reads in **a** *padas;* in **b**, *catvāry aṣpadāni;* in  
**c**, *madhyato varadhrāṁ*. ⌊For *úṣyala*, cf. note to vi. 139. 3.⌋  
⌊For the addition to the Anukr. at this point, see above, p. 740, ¶2,  
and especially the note to XV. 5. 7.⌋

Bhaga hath formed the four legs of the litter, wrought the four pieces that compose the frame-work. Tvashtar hath decked the straps that go across it, May it be blest, and bring us happy fortune.
