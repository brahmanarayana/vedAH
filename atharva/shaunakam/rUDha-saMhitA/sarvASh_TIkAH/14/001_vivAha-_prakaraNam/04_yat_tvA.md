### Translation
4. When, O Soma, they drink thee ⌊up⌋, then thou fillest thyself up  
again; Vāyu is Soma's defender; the month is norm (*ā́kṛti*) of the years  
(*sámā*).

### Notes
RV. (x. 85. 5) reads *deva* for *soma* in **a**. The verse (as noted  
above) is wanting in Ppp.

When they begin to drink thee, then, O God, thou swellest out again. Vayu in Soma's sentinel. The month is that which shapes the years.
