### Translation
54. Let Indra-and-Agni, heaven-and-earth, Mātariśvan, Mitra-and-Varuṇa,  
Bhaga, both Aśvins, Brihaspati, the Maruts, the *bráhman*. Soma,  
increase this woman with progeny.

### Notes
Ppp. has again *nāryaṁ* in **d**. Only **a** is a real *jagatī* pāda,  
even by number of syllables (and doubtless we are to read *-pṛthvī́*);  
the second definition of it in the Anukr. notices this.
