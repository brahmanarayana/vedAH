### Translation
12. Clean were the (two) wheels of thee as thou wentest; out-breathing  
(*vyāná*) was the inserted axle; a cart made of mind did Sūryā ascend  
when going forth to her husband.

### Notes
Is RV. x. 85. 12, without variant. The *pada*-reading *manasmayam* in  
**c** is by Prāt. iv. 24. ⌊Here Roth's Collation says "*śacī* wie  
Vulgata"!⌋

Pure, as thou wentest, were thy wheels, breath was the axle pier- cing them. Surya advancing to her lord rode on the chariot of her heart.
