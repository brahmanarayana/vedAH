### Translation
61. The well-flowered (*sukiṅśuká*), all-formed bridal-car (*vahatú*),  
golden-colored, well-rolling, well-wheeled, do thou mount, O Sūryā, to  
the world of the immortal; make thou a bridal -car pleasant to husbands.

### Notes
The verse is RV. x. 85. 20, which reads *śalmalím* in **a** for  
*vahatúm*, and in **d** *pátye* for *pátibhyas*, and *kṛṇuṣva* for *kṛṇu  
tvám*. MB. (i. 3. 11) also has *śalmalim*, *patye*, and *kṛṇuṣva*, but  
further in **b** *suvarṇavarṇaṁ sukṛtam*, and in **c** *nābhim* for  
*lokam*. ⌊Cf. MP. i. 6. 4; MGS. i. 13. 6 and p. 157.⌋ Kāuś. 77. 1  
combines it with 2. 30, as used when the bride is made to mount the  
vehicle that takes her to her new home. Ppp. has in **c** *sukṛtasya  
loke*. The verse is a good *triṣṭubh*.
