### Translation
27. Unlovely becomes \[his\] body, glistening in that evil way, when the  
husband wraps his own member with the bride's garment.

### Notes
RV. (x. 85. 30) reads at the beginning *aśrīrā́*, and at the end  
*-dhítsate;* Ppp. also has *aśrīrā;* ⌊and *tanus* for *tanū́s*⌋. Most of  
our mss. (all save P.M.W.) give *vā́sasas* in **c**, and this is  
accordingly more probably to be regarded as the AV. reading. ⌊So SPP.  
with all his authorities.⌋ ⌊The Berlin ed. has *vā́sasā*, to accord with  
the RV.⌋ *An̄ga* might mean 'body' (so the translators). ⌊For vss. 27,  
28, 29, cf. respectively MP. i. 17. 8, 10, 9, and see Wint., p. 100.⌋
