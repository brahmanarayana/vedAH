### Translation
39. Let the Brahmans take for her \[water\] for bathing; let them draw  
up (?) waters that slay not a hero; let her go about the fire of  
Aryaman, O Pūshan; father-in-law and brother-in-law are looking on  
(*prati-īkṣ*).

### Notes
The translation implies the obvious emendation of *ajantu* to *acantu*  
in **b**. ⌊Cf. the MP. reading *acantu*, and also xi. 1. 2, where vacant  
answers to the RV. reading *vā́cam*. There is also something wrong about  
**d**, where a plural verb is made to agree with two singular subjects.  
The Āpast. *mantra*-text (Wint., p. 43 ⌊MP. i. 1. 7-8⌋) has in both  
pādas (as well as in other respects) better readings: *ā́ ’syāí brāhmaṇā́ḥ  
snápanaṁ harantu: ávīraghnīr úd acantv ā́paḥ\*: aryamṇó agním pári yantu  
kṣiprám prátī ”kṣantāṁ śvaśrúvo devárāś ca*. Ppp. reads in **a-b** *ā  
’smāi harantu snapanaṁ brahmaṇā ’vīr-*; and in **c**, *‘gniṁ pary eti  
kṣipraṁ*. ⌊The *kṣipram* of Ppp. and MP. suggests that⌋ our *pūṣan* in  
**c** may be a corruption for *oṣám;* ⌊cf. also vii. 73. 6 **a**⌋. The  
use of the verse by Kāuś. 75. 17 was noticed in the preceding note; in  
76. 20, the second half-verse accompanies the leading of the bride  
thrice about the fire (in Āpast. the laying of a ring of *darbha*-grass  
upon her head). The Anukr. does not heed the lack of a syllable in  
**b**. \*⌊Oxford text *āpaḥ:* misprint?⌋

Hither let Brahmans bring her bathing water; let them draw such as guards the lives of heroes. Aryaman's fire let her encircle, Pushan! Fathers-in-law stand, with their sons, expectant.
