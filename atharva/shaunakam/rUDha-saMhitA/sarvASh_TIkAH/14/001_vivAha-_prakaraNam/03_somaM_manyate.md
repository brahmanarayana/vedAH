### Translation
3. One thinks himself to have drunk Soma when they crush up an herb;  
what Soma the priests (*brahmán*) know, of that no earthly man partakes.

### Notes
RV. (x. 85. 3) reads at the end *káś caná* for *pā́rthivas*. In **b**,  
Bs.P.M.W.T. read *-piṣanti*, D. *-pīṣanti;* Ppp. has *-piśanti*. The  
*pratīka* is quoted in GB. i. 2.9 ⌊printed 8⌋.
