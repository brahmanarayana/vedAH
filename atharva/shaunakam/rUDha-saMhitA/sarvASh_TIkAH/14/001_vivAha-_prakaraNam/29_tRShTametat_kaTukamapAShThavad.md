### Translation
29. Harsh is that, sharp, barbed, poisoned; that is not to be eaten;  
what priest (*brahmán*) knows Sūryā, he indeed deserves the bride's  
\[garment\].

### Notes
RV. (x. 85. 34) inserts another *etát* after *káṭukam*, and reads  
*vidyā́t* for *véda* in **c**. The omission of *káṭukam* (with, in RV.,  
*etát*) would rectify the meter of **a**; as it stands, it is an  
extremely poor "*bṛhatī*" pāda. *Áttave* 'to be eaten' is very strange  
here. Sūryā in **c** is generally understood to mean 'the Sūryā-hymn.'

Pungent is this, bitter is this, filled as it were with arrow barbs, empoisoned and not fit for use. The Brahman who knows Surya well deserves the garment of the bride.
