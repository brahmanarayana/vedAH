### Translation
44. Be thou supreme among fathers-in-law, supreme also among  
brothers-in-law; be thou supreme over sister-in-law, supreme also over  
mother-in-law.

### Notes
The verse is RV. x. 85. 46, which, however, reads for **a**, *s. śváśure  
bhava;* for **b**, *s. śvaśrvā́m bhava;* for **c**, *nánāndari s. bhava;*  
for **d**, *s. ádhi devṛ́ṣu;* and MB. (i. 2. 20) agrees throughout with  
RV. (*śvaśryām* in **b** must be a blunder). ⌊MP. i. 6. 6 follows RV.,  
but with *śvaśruvā́m* in **b**: cf. Wint, p. 66.⌋
