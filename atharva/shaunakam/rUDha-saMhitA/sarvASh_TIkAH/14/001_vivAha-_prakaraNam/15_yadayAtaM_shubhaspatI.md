### Translation
15. When ye went, O lords of beauty, unto the wooing of Sūryā, all the  
gods assented to that \[deed\] of yours; Pūshan as son chose a father.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
This verse, again, corresponds to parts of two in the RV., namely x. 85.  
15 **a, b** and 14 **c, d**; the only variant is that RV. reads  
*pitárāu* for *-ram* in **d**, and Ppp. *pitarā ’vṛ-*, which doubtless  
means the same. Metrically the verse is as much *virāj* as vs. 14.

Twin Lords of Lustre, at the time when ye to Surya's wooing came, Then all the Gods agreed to your proposal Pushan as son elected you as father.
