### Translation
34. Free from thorns, straight, let the roads be by which \[our\]  
comrades go a-wooing for us; together with Bhaga, together with  
Aryaman—let Dhātar unite \[us\] with splendor.

### Notes
The first half-verse is RV. x. 85. 23 **a, b**, which, however, reads  
⌊with MP.⌋ *pánthās* for ⌊our metrically bad⌋ *-thānas;* the second half  
goes on: *sám aryamā́ sám bhágo no ninīyāt* etc. ⌊cf. MP. i. 1. 2⌋; our  
text is a foolish and inconsistent substitute. Kāuś. 77. 3 gives the  
verse, with 2. 11, as to be used when the bridal train starts off home;  
in 75. 12 it ⌊according to Daśa Kar., only the first half-verse⌋ is made  
to accompany the sending out of a guard for the bride. ⌊Cf. Wint., p.  
40.⌋

Straight in direction be the paths, and thornless, whereby our fellows travel to the wooing. With Bhaga and with Aryaman Dhatar endue the pair with strength!
