### Translation
8. The laudations (*stóma*) were the cross-pieces (?? *pratidhí*); meter  
was the *kurī́ra*, the *opaśá;* of Sūryā the Aśvins were the wooers, Agni  
was the forerunner.

### Notes
Is RV. x. 85. 8, without variant. For *kurī́ra* and *opaśá*, women's  
head-dresses or parts of such, compare vi. 138. In this connection the  
commentators' explanation of *pratidhí* "cross-pieces on the  
chariot-pole" is extremely unlikely; it must rather be some article of a  
woman's dress. Ppp. reads and combines *paridhayaṣ k-*.

Songs were the cross-bars of the pole, Kurira metre docked her head. Both Asvins were the paranymphs: Agni was leader of the train.
