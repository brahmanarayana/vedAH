### Translation
24. Ever new art thou, being born; sign of the days, thou goest to the  
apex of the dawns; thou disposest to the gods their share as thou  
comest; thou extendest, O moon, a long life-time.

### Notes
These two verses are repeated here from vii. 81. 1, 2; ⌊see the notes to  
those verses: also the Anukr. extracts at p. 739, ¶4. which refer vs. 23  
to sun and moon and vs. 24 to the moon⌋. Most of verse 23 we had also as  
xiii. 2. 11. In order to make sure that the two right ones are  
reproduced, all our mss. read here *pūrvāparáṁ návonavaḥ* (instead of,  
as usual, *pūrvāparám íti dvé*). They are RV. x. 85. 18, 19, and are  
found also in other texts, as to which and the various readings see the  
notes to vii. 81. 1, 2. Ppp. has in 23 **d** (with RV.) *jāyate punaḥ*,  
and in 24 (also with RV.) *bhavati*, *eti*, and *dadhāti* (but  
apparently *tirase*). In Kāuś. 75. 6, vs. 23 (according to the comm.,  
both 23 and 24) is used with vs. 1; in 79. 28, vs. 64 is allowed instead  
of vs. 24, in case the latter is not known.

Thou, born afresh, art new and new for ever; ensign of days, before the Dawns thou goest. Coming, thou orderest for Gods their portion. Thou lengthenest, Moon, the days of our existence.
