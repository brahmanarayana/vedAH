### Translation
32. May ye be just here; may ye not go away; may ye, O kine, increase  
this man with progeny; going in beauty, ruddy, with soma-splendor—may  
all the gods turn (*kṛ*) your minds hither.

### Notes
In Kāuś. 79. 17 this verse (according to the commentators, this and the  
next) seems to be directed to accompany the paying (in kine) the price  
demanded for the bride; but surely that cannot have been its original  
sense. The first pāda is identical with iii. 8. 4 **a**; **c** has a  
redundant syllable. The *pada*-text writes *śúbham: yatīḥ*, but the  
expression is, so far as accent is concerned, treated as if a compound:  
compare 2. 52 below. No reason is discoverable for the accent of *krán*  
in **d**.

Remain ye even here and go no farther: strengthen this man, ye Cows, with plenteous offspring. May Dawns that come for glory, bright with Soma, here may all Gods fix and enchant your spirits.
