### Translation
42. Hoping for well-willing, offspring, good-fortune, wealth, becoming  
obedient (*ánuvrata*) to thy husband, gird thyself in order to  
immortality.

### Notes
This verse also is found in Ppp. away from the rest, in book xx., and  
with much difference of text: thus, **b-d**, *praco bahur atho balam:  
indrāṇy anuvratā san nahye amṛtāya kam*. In Kāuś. 76. 7, the verse is  
used, with 2. 70, when the bride is girded with a bond, a yoke-rope  
(*yoktra*). The Āpast. version (Wint., p. 45 ⌊MP. i. 2. 7⌋) has *tanū́m*  
for *rayím* in **b**, *agnér* for *pátyur* in **c**, and, for **d**,  
*sáṁ nahye sukṛtā́ya kám*. Vāit. 2. 6, again, makes it accompany the  
girding of the sacrificer's wife at the sacrifice. ⌊In the Berlin ed.,  
correct *kam* to *kám*.⌋
