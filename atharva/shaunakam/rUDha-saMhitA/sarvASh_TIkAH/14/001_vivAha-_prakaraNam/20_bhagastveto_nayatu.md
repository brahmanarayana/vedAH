### Translation
20. Let Bhaga lead thee hence, grasping thy hand; let the Aśvins carry  
thee forth by a chariot; go to the houses, that thou mayest be  
housewife; thou, having control, shalt speak unto the council.

### Notes
RV. (x. 85. 26) begins with *pūṣā́* instead of *bhágas*. In Kāuś. (76.  
10) the verse accompanies the leading of the bride out of her house.

Let Bhaga take thy hand and hence conduct thee: let the two Asvins on their car transport thee. Go to the house to be the household's mistress, and speak as lady to thy gathered people.
