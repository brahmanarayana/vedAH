### Translation
46. They bewail the living one (m.); they lead away the sacrifice  
(*adhvará*); the men sent their thoughts after ⌊root *dhī...ánu*⌋ a long  
reach (*prásiti*); what is lovely (*vāmá*) for the Fathers who came  
together here; joy to the husbands for embracing the wife.

### Notes
This is a literal version of this extremely obscure verse. RV. (x. 40.  
10) reads in **a** *ví mayante adhvaré*; in **b**, the equivalent  
*dīdhiyus* ⌊so also Ppp.⌋; in **c**, the equivalent *sameriré;* in  
**d**, *jánayas* (for our *janáye*, which might better have been emended  
in the edition to *jánaye*); ⌊Ppp. reads and combines *janayaṣ*⌋. The  
Āpast. text (Wint., p. 42 ⌊MP. i. 1. 6⌋) reads at the beginning *jīvām*.  
The verse is used, with 2. 59, in Kāuś. 79. 30, simply to accompany a  
libation, at the very close of the marriage rites. In two Sūtras (AGS.  
⌊i. 8. 4⌋ and śGS. ⌊i. 15. 2⌋) it is directed to be used when the bride,  
on the journey to her new home, wails or cries; this is plainly only on  
account of the word 'bewail' (*rudanti*) at the beginning. ⌊Cf. Lanman's  
*Skt. Reader*, p. 387; Winternitz, p. 42; and Bloomfield, who devotes 9  
pages to the stanza in AJP. xxi. 411-9.⌋

They mourn the living, they arrange the sacred rite: the men have set their thoughts upon a distant cast: They who have brought the Fathers this delightful gift, when wives allowed their lords the joy of their embrace.
