### Translation
40. Weal be to thee gold, and weal be waters; weal be the post  
(*methí*), weal the perforation (*tárdman*) of the yoke; weal be for  
thee the waters having a hundred cleansers (*-pavítra*); for weal, too,  
mingle thyself with thy husband.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Ppp. is much corrupted in this verse, but can be seen to read *metis*  
for *methis* in **b**; in **c** it combines *tā ”paḥ*, and in **d** it  
omits *u*. In Kāuś. 76. 12, the verse is muttered (according to the  
*paddhati*, it and the following verse) while the bride is bound to the  
right yoke-pole and the left yoke-hole, and a piece of gold is fastened  
to her forehead. Purification by the yoke-hole (apparently growing out  
of the occurrence of the next verse in RV.) plays a part in various  
versions of the marriage-rites; ⌊cf. note to vs. 41⌋. Āpast. (Wint., p.  
44 ⌊MP. i. 1. 10⌋) has this same verse with unimportant variations  
(*medhī* in **b**, etc). ⌊Cf. Wint., p. 46.⌋ The verse (11 + 12: 11 + 11  
= 45) is slightly irregular ⌊but has *triṣṭubh*-cndences throughout⌋.

Blest be the gold to thee, and blest the water, blest the yoke's opening, and blest the pillar. Blest he the waters with their hundred cleansings: blest be thy body's union with thy husband.
