### Translation
45 . Beautiful \[are\] heaven-and-earth, pleasant near by, of great  
courses; seven divine waters have flowed; let them free us from  
distress.

### Notes
This verse is a repetition of vii. 112. 1. Ppp. reads in **b**  
*yantusumne*, and, for **c**, *āpas sapta sravantīs* (*tā* etc.). The  
redundant syllable in **c** is not noticed by the Anukr. here, although  
it was so at the other occurrence. The verse is used by Kāuś. 78. 10  
with vs. 1 (see the note to that verse), and again in 78. 13 it  
accompanies the pouring of water into the folded hands of the pair; and  
yet again, in 79. 25, the pouring of water on the bridal garment; this  
use is evidently the one which gives the verse its place here.
