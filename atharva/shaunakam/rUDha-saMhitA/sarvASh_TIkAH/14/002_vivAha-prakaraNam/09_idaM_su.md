### Translation
9. Pray hear ye now of me, O men, by what blessing (*āśís*) the two  
spouses attain what is agreeable (*vāmá*): what Gandharvas \[there are\]  
and heavenly Apsarases, who stand upon these forest trees  
(*vānaspatyá*), let them be pleasant unto this bride; let them not  
injure the bridal-car as it is driven.

### Notes
The last four padas form a verse also in the Āpast. text (Wint., p. 70  
⌊MP. i. 7. 8⌋), where for our **d** is read *eṣú vṛkṣéṣu vānaspatyéṣv  
ā́sate*, further *śivā́s* (for *syonā́s*) and *vadhvāì* in **e**, and  
*ūhyámānām* in **f**. In TS. iii. 2. 8⁴ is found the phrase *yám āśírā  
dámpatī vāmám aśnutáḥ*, and *āśīrdāyā́ dámpatī vāmám aśnutām*. The verse  
is to be used, according to Kāuś. 77. 9, when the bridal train passes  
great trees. The Anukr. ⌊appears to scan as 9 + 12: 11 + 12: 11 + 11 =  
66; but pāda **a** is essentially defective⌋. All our mss. ⌊and SPP's  
authorities⌋ read in **e** *te*, which our edition emends to *té;* ⌊but  
SPP. reads *te*, construing **a-d** together, and **e-f** separately:  
'unto thee, the bride here'; which seems hard⌋. Ppp. combines in **c**  
*gandharvā ’ps-*.

Here these my words, ye men, the benediction through which the wedded pair have found high fortune. May the divine Apsarases, Gandharvas, all they who are these fruitful trees' protectors, Regard this bride with their auspicious, favour, nor harm the nuptial pomp as it advances.
