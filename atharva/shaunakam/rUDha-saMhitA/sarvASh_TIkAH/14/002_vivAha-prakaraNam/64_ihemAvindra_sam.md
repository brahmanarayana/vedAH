### Translation
64. Here, O Indra, do thou push together these two spouses like two  
*cakravākás;* let them, with \[their\] progeny, well-homed, live out all  
their life-time.

### Notes
Ppp. has in **c** the better reading *prajāvantāu sv-*, and, in **d**,  
*dīrgham* for *viśvam*. Some of our mss. (Bp.E.T.K.) ⌊and three of  
SPP's⌋ read at the end *-nutam*. The Kāúś. (79. 9), on account of the  
verb *sam-nud*, has the verse used to accompany the act of coition.

Join thou this couple, Indra! like the Chakravaka and his. mate: May they attain to full old age with children in their happy home.
