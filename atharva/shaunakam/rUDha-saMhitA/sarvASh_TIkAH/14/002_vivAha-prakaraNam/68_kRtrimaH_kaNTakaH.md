### Translation
68. The artificial hundred-toothed comb (?) that is here shall scratch  
away the defilement of the hair of her, away that of her head.

### Notes
The majority of our mss. (all but Bs.s.m.P.R.) read *káṇṭakas* 'thorn'  
in **a**. Ppp. has *kan̄kadas*. The Kāuś. text, 76. 5, with the  
subsidiary texts (see note to that rule), gives *kan̄kata*, with our  
edition. There is little to choose between the two readings. Ppp. reads  
in **b** *apā ’syāt k-*. The verse, which is a *purauṣṇih*, is not  
defined by the Anukr. Kāuś. 76. 5 makes it accompany the combing of the  
bride's hair after she has been bathed and (with 1. 45, 53) clothed in a  
new garment.
