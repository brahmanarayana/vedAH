### Translation
38. Send, O Pūshan, her, most propitious, in whom men scatter seed  
(*bī́ja*); who, eager, shall part our thighs; in whom we, eager, may  
insert the member.

### Notes
The verse is RV. x. 85. 37, which, however, reads at end of **c** (with  
Ppp.) *-śrayāte* ⌊'who, eager, shall part her thighs, for us'⌋, and of  
**d** *-hárāma śépam*. All our mss. accent *pū́ṣan* in **a**; Bp. begins  
**c** with *yā́ḥ: naḥ*. The same verse is found in HGS. i. 20. 2, with  
*nas* after *tām* in **a**, *visrayātāi* in **c**, and *-harema śepam*  
in **d**. PGS. (i. 4. 16) has a corresponding, but quite different,  
text: *sā naḥ pūṣā śivatamām e ”raya sā na ūrū uśatī vi hara: yasyām  
uśantaḥ praharāma śepaṁ yasyām u kāmā bahavo niviṣtyāi*. The Āpast. text  
(Wint., p. 90 ⌊MP. i. 11. 6⌋) has the RV. version, except *-śráyātāi* at  
end of **c**. ⌊Barring the bad cesura in **a**, the verse is a good  
*triṣṭubh*; but the definition (as noted under vs. 34) is omitted by the  
Anukr.⌋

Send her most rich in every charm, O Pushan, her who shall be the sharer of my pleasures; Her who shall twine her eager arms about me, and welcome all my love and soft embraces.
