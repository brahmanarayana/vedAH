### Translation
15. Stand firm; *virā́j* art thou; as it were, Vishṇu here, O Sarasvatī;  
O Sinīvālī, let her have progeny; may she be in the favor of Bhaga.

### Notes
Kāuś. 76. 33 uses the verse to accompany the act of making the bride  
stand firm after rising from the couch. The Anukr. forbids us to  
abbreviate to *’va* in **b**. In Ppp. a considerable part of the verse  
is lost. The second half-verse appears again below as 21 **c, d**.

Take thou thy stand, a Queen art thou, like Vishnu here, Sarasvati! O Sinivali, let her bear children, and live in Bhaga's grace.
