### Translation
48. Away from us let the darkness shine (*vas*), that is deep blue,  
brown (*piśán̄ga*), also red; she who is consuming, spotted, her I fasten  
(*ā-saj*) on this pillar.

### Notes
The latter half-verse is corrupt in Ppp. beyond intelligibility. ⌊The  
definition *sataḥpan¯kti* (cf. my note to vi. 20. 3 and *Ind. Stud.*  
viii. 45) presumably means 9 + 11: 9 + 11. If we could dispense with the  
*yā́* in **c**, the verse would be excellent so far as rhythm and cadence  
go (8 + 11: 8 + 11).⌋ It is used in Kāuś. 79. 22 in connection with  
taking away the bridal garment to cleanse it. The 'she' is perhaps the  
female demon supposed to belong to the defiled article.

Let him flash gloom away from us, the blue, the yellow and the red. I fasten to this pillar here the burning pest Prishataki.
