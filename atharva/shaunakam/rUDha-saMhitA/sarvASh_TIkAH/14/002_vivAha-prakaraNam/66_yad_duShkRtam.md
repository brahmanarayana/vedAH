### Translation
66. What ill deed, what pollution at the wedding, and what on the bridal  
car—that difficulty do we wipe off on the dress (*kambalá*) of the  
wooer.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Ppp. reads in **c** *sambharasya*. Kāuś. 76. 1 makes the verse accompany  
the rubbing of the bride dry after the bath with a garment, which is  
then carried to the woods and fastened to a tree.

Whatever fault or error was in marriage or in bridal pomp. This woe we wipe away upon the cloak the interceder wears.
