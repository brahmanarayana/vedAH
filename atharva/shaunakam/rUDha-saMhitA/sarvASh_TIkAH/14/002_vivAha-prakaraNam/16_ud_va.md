### Translation
16. Let your wave smite up the pegs; O waters, release the yoke-ropes  
(*yóktra*); let not the two inviolable \[kine\], not evil-doing, free  
from guilt, come upon what is unpropitious (? *áśuna*).

### Notes
The verse is RV. iii. 33. 13, which, however, reads *śū́nam* for *áśunam*  
in **d**, and *vyènasā* for *-sāu* in **d**; and Ppp. agrees with RV.  
⌊W's "\[kine\]" seems to overlook the gender of *aghnyāú:* see  
Griffith's note, p. 174.⌋ Kāuś. 77. 15 makes the verse accompany the  
sprinkling of the car and unyoking of the oxen at the end of the bridal  
journey.

So let your wave bear up the pins, and ye, O Waters, spare the thongs; And never may the holy pair, sinless and innocent, suffer harm.
