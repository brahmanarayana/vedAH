### Translation
6. Do thou (f.), rejoicing with propitious mind, assign wealth having  
all heroes, to be extolled; an easy crossing (*tīrthá*), well provided  
with drink, O lords (du.) of beauty; do ye smite away the pillar  
standing in the road, \[namely\] disfavor.

### Notes
This verse is altered from RV. x. 40. 13 in a strange and senseless  
manner. RV. reads for **a, b** *tā́ mandasānā́ mánuṣo duroṇá ā́ dhattáṁ  
rayíṁ sahávīraṁ vacasyáve*, thus making the verse concern the Aśvins  
throughout; who is our 'thou' (*sā́*) does not appear. In **c** the sense  
is destroyed by altering the RV. verb *kṛtám* (as if it were  
misunderstood for a participle) to *sugám;* and in **d** *patheṣṭhā́m*  
(p. *pathe॰sthā́m*) is turned to *páthiṣṭhām* (p. *páthi॰sthām*) and  
accented as if it were a superlative; ⌊cf. the confusion at vi. 28. 1⌋.  
The verse is used also in the Āpast. sūtra (Wint., p. 68 ⌊MP. i. 6.  
12⌋), with *daśavīram* in **b** as its only variant from RV. Ppp.  
appears to read with our text. The verse lacks two syllables of being a  
real *jagatī*. In Kāuś. 77. 8 the verse is directed to be used on  
arriving at a ford or river-crossing on the bridal journey.

Thou, Dame, rejoicing, take with kindly spirit wealth worthy to be famed, with all thy heroes. Give, Lords of Light a fair ford, good to drink at: remove the spiteful stump that blocks the pathway.
