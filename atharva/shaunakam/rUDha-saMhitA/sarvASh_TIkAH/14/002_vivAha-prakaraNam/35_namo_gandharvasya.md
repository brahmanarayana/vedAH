### Translation
35. Homage to the Gandharva's mind (?), and homage to his terrible  
(*bhā́ma*) eye we pay; O Viśvāvasu, homage \[be\] to thee with worship  
(*bráhman*); go away unto thy wives, the Apsarases.

### Notes
The translation implies the naturally suggested emendation in **a** of  
*námase* to *mánase*, which Ppp. supports, reading *manaso*. Ppp. has  
further *bhāsāya* for *bhāmāya* in **b**; and, for **c**, *viśvāvaso  
namo brahmaṇā te kṛṇomi*, and, in **d**, combines *jāyā ’ps-*. The  
addition of *‘stu* at the end of our **c** would rectify the meter of  
the pāda and make the definition of the Anukr. exact.

Homage we pay to the Gandharva's favour, obeisance to his eye and fiery anger. Visvavasu, with prayer we pay thee homage. Go hence to those Apsarases thy consorts.
