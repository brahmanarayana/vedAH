### Translation
30. The gold-cushioned (? *prastaraṇa*) vehicle, bearing all forms, did  
Sūryā, Savitar's daughter, mount, in order to great good-fortune.

### Notes
⌊Nearly⌋ all our mss. ⌊and four of SPP's⌋ accent *rukmáprást-* (p.  
*rukmá॰prást-*) in **a**; our edition emends to *rukmápra-*. ⌊SPP., with  
13 of his authorities, reads *rukmaprá-*. The verse is used with 1. 61  
(Kāuś. 77. 1), when the bride mounts the car. ⌊Note *bíbhratam* joined  
with *vahyám*, neuter! is the case like those of *cakrám āśúm*, *rátnam  
bṛhántam*, *gotráṁ hariśríyam* of RV.? cf. my *Noun-inflection*, p. 600,  
*s.v.* *Genders*.⌋
