### Translation
50. What is my dearest self (*tanū́*), that of me is afraid of the  
garment; of it do thou, O forest-lord, make first (*ágre*) for thyself  
an inner wrap (*nīví*); let us not suffer harm.

### Notes
This verse is used in Kāuś. 79. 24 next after the two preceding, the  
person who has the garment in charge wrapping a tree with it. The Anukr.  
contains no definition of the meter (8 + 8: 8 + 11 = 35). The verse, as  
noted above, is wanting in Ppp.

My body that I hold most dear trembles in terror at this robe. Tree, make an apron at the top. Let no misfortune fall on us.
