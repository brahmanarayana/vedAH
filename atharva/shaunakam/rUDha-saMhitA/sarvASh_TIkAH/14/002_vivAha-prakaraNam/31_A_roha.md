### Translation
31. Mount the couch with favoring mind; here give birth to progeny for  
this husband; like Indrāṇī, waking with good awakening, mayest thou  
watch to meet dawns tipped with light.

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **c** *suptā* for *subúdhā*, of which the stem and sense  
are questionable (it occurs elsewhere only in vs. 75, below); at the end  
it has *cākaraḥ* (for *jāgaraḥ*). ⌊Cf. Wint, p. 92.⌋ The excess of  
syllables in **d** is a very poor reason for calling the verse (11 + 11:  
11 + 13 = 46) a *jagatī*. In Kāuś. 76. 25 the verse is used, with 1. 60,  
when the bride mounts the couch; and again, 79. 4, when she ascends the  
nuptial bed (vs. 23 immediately follows: see above).

Rise, mount the bridal bed with cheerful spirit. Here bring forth children to this man thy husband. Watchful and understanding like Indrani wake thou before the earliest light of Morning.
