### Translation
13. Propitious hath this woman come to the home; Dhātar appointed this  
world (sphere) to her; her let Aryaman, Bhaga, both Aśvins, Prajāpati,  
increase with progeny.

### Notes
The Anukr. takes no notice of the irregularities of the meter (9 + 11:  
10 + 11 = 41). ⌊It defines the verse twice, first as *triṣṭubh*, then as  
*purobṛhatī* (cf. vi. 126. 3). Pādas **b** and **d** are good *triṣṭubh*  
pādas; and **a** and **c** will pass if we resolve *naārī iyam* and  
*taām*.⌋
