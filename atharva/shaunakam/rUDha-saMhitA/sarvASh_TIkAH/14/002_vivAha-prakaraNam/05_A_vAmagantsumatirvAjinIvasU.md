### Translation
5. Your favor hath come, O ye (two) of abundant good things (?  
*vājínīvasu*); \[our\] desires have rested in \[your\] hearts, O Aśvins;  
ye have been twin keepers, O lords of beauty; may we, being dear, attain  
favorers (*aryamán*) of our homes (? *dúrya*).

### Notes
The verse is RV. x. 40. 12, RV., however, reading *ayaṅsata* at end of  
**b**. ⌊MP. i. 7. 11 follows the RV. text, but with *kāmāṅ* for *kāmās:*  
cf. Wint., p. 70.⌋ More points than one in the translation are doubtful.

Your favouring grace hath come, ye who are rich in spoil! Asvins, your longings are stored up within your hearts. Ye, Lords of Splendour have become our twofold guard: may we as dear friends reach the dwelling of the friend.
