### Translation
61. If (*yát*) sisters (*jāmí*), if young women, have danced together  
in thy house, doing evil with wailing—from that sin etc. etc.

### Notes
Because of the redundant syllable ⌊the second *yád*, intrusion?⌋ in  
**a**, the Anukr. absurdly separates this verse from the others here,  
and calls it a *triṣṭubh*.

If the bride's sisters, if young maids have danced together in thy house, committing sin with shout and cry. May Agni free thee from that guilt, may Savitar deliver thee.
