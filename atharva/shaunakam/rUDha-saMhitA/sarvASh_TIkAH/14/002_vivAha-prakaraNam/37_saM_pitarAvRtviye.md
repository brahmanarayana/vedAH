### Translation
37. Unite (*sam-sṛj*), O ye (two) parents (*pitṛ́*), the (two) things  
that are seasonable; ye shall be mother and father of seed; as a male  
(*márya*) a female (*yóṣā*), do thou mount her; make ye (two) progeny;  
here enjoy (*puṣ*) wealth.

### Notes
⌊For "mount her," W. suggests in pencil "make her mount"; but I suspect  
that the full expression would be *ádhi rohaya śépa enām*. In **a**,  
*ṛ́tviye* is regarded by the *pada*-text as dual, and is translated  
accordingly; it probably means the respective contributions of the two  
to the embryo. Ppp. reads instead (*-rā*) *vṛddhaye*, a welcome  
emendation. Further, in **b**, it puts *pitā*, before *mātā* and has  
*ja* for *ca* and ends **b** with *bhavātha;* ⌊and it makes our 37  
**d** and 39 **c** change place, but with *puṣyatu no* for our  
*puṣyatam*⌋. ⌊Pronounce *máryeva* in **c**: the verse then scans easily  
as 11 + 11: 11 + 12, if we accept the resolution *ṛ́tuiye* in **a**.⌋  
According to Kāuś. 79. 8, it is used in the act of coition. ⌊Concerning  
the matter as an essential element of the ritual, see Winternitz, p.  
92.⌋ Ppp. arranges this and the following six verses in the order 37,  
40, 38, 39, 42, 41. 43.
