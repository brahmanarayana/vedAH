### Translation
65. What is done on the chair (*āsandī́*), on the cushion (*upadhā́na*),  
or what on the covering (*upavā́sana*); what witchcraft they have made at  
the wedding (*vivāhá*)—that do we deposit in the bath.

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **a** *āsandhyā up-*. By Kāuś. 75. 26, the verse is used  
at the bride's bath, next after vss. 52-58, and before 1. 35, 43.  
⌊Griffith would seem to take *yád* as virtually equivalent to *yā́ṁ  
kṛtyā́m*.\]  
  
⌊The *āsandī́* appears to be now a throne (cf. AB. viii. 5, 6, 12), and  
now something between a lounging chair and a bed, 'a long reclining  
chair' such as Anglo-Indians use today with more comfort than elegance.  
That it was usable also as a bier carried by four bearers appears from  
Dīgha Nikāya, ii. 23, and Buddhaghosa's scholion. Compare also the  
description below, AV. xv. 3. 3 ff.—In Hāla's Saptaśataka, *āsandiā* is  
glossed by *khaṭvā* (no. 112, ed. 1870) or *paryan̄kikā* (no. 700, ed.  
1881).⌋

Whatever magic hath been wrought on cushion, chair, or canopy. Each spell to mar the wedding rites, all this we throw into the bath.
