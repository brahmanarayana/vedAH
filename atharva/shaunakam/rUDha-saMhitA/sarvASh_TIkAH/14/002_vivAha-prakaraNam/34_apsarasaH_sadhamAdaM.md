### Translation
34. The Apsarases revel a joint reveling, between the oblation-holder  
and the sun; they are thy birthplace; go away to them; homage I pay thee  
with the Gandharva-season.

### Notes
The first half-verse is identical with vii. 109. 3 **a, b**. The verse,  
a fairly good *triṣṭubh*, appears, with vss. 36 and 38, to be passed  
over by the ⌊London⌋ Anukr. ⌊The Berlin ms. gives the three *pratīkas*,  
followed, without *iti*, by *agastatakṣe* (!).⌋ Ppp. begins the verse  
with *yā ’psarasas s-* (for *yā́ aps-*), and in **b** puts *antara* (for  
*-rā*) before *havirdhānam* .

Apsarases rejoice and feast together between the sun and place of sacrificing. These are thy kith and kin: go thou and join them: I in due season worship thee Gandharva.
