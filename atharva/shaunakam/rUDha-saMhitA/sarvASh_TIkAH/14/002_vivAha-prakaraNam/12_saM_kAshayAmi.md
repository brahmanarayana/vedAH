### Translation
12. I cause the bridal-car to be viewed by the houses with worship  
(*bráhman*), with a friendly, not terrible eye; what of all forms is  
fastened on about, let Savitar make that pleasant for the husbands.

### Notes
Ppp. reads at the end *kṛṇotu tat*. According to Kāuś. 77. 14, the verse  
is uttered when the train comes in sight of the house. Āpast. vi. 6  
(Wint., p. 70 ⌊MP. i. 7. 10⌋) has the same verse, with the variants  
*māítreṇa* in **b**, *asyā́m* for *ásti* in **c**, and (like Ppp.)  
*kṛṇotu tát* at the end. The comm. to Āpast. understands **c** of the  
ornaments worn by the bride, as indicated by the reading *asyā́m*. The  
verse (13 + 11: 11 + 12 = 47) is but a poor *jagatī*.

I look upon the house and bride's procession with prayer and with the gentle eye of friendship. All that is covered there in perfect beauty may Savitar make pleasant to the husband.
