### Translation
71. He am I, she thou; chant am I, verse thou; heaven I, earth thou; let  
us (two) come together here; let us generate progeny.

### Notes
The verse (8 + 8 + 8: 7 + 8 = 39) is strangely called a *bṛhatī* by the  
Anukr. It is found, with more or less variation, in a host of other  
texts: AB. (viii. 27. 4), TB. (iii. 7.1⁹), K. (xxxv. 18), śB. (xiv. 9.  
4¹⁹), AGS. (i. 7. 6), PCS. (i. 6. 3), HGS. (i. 20. 2), Āp. (ix. 2. 3).  
In the first pāda, TB. (with which HGS. and Āp. agree throughout) has  
the unintelligent reading *ámūhám;* AB. has *sa* for *sā*, which seems  
also a mere blunder. After this, AB.śB.AGS.PGS. add the same, inverted:  
*sā́* (AB. *sa* again) *tvám asy ámo ‘hám* (śB. PGS. *ahám*). As regards  
our third pāda, there is no variant in reading, but AB.TB.AGS.HGS.Āp.  
put it before our second. In our second pāda, the same texts omit the  
*asmi;* the whole pāda is wanting in Ppp. For our **d**, AB. has *tāv  
eha saṁ vahāvahāi*, and ends there; TB. etc. give as ending to the verse  
*tā́v é ’hi sám bhavāva* *sahá réto dadhāvahāi puṁsé putrā́ya véttavāi;*  
śB. nearly the same, but with *saṁrabhā́vahāi*, *dadhā́vahāi*, and  
*víttaye;* AGS. instead *tāv e ’he vi vahāvahāi prajām pra janayāvahāi;*  
PGS. spins out the longest ending: *tāv e ’hi vi vahāvahāi saha reto  
dadhāvahāi prajām pra janayāvahāi putrān vindāvahāi bahūn te santu  
jaradaṣṭayaḥ*. ⌊Cf. MP. i. 3. 14, and Wint., p. 52; also MGS. i. 10. 15  
d, and p. 146, and i. 10. 15 e, and p. 150, s.v. *tā;* also GB. ii. 3.  
20; JUB. i. 54.⌋ Kāuś. 79. 10 uses the verse, with i. 34. 1, after the  
consummation of the union.

I am this man, that dame art thou I am the psalm and thou the verse. I am the heaven and thou the earth. So will we dwell together here, parents of children yet to be.
