### Translation
70. I gird thee with the milk of the earth; I gird thee with the milk of  
the herbs; I gird thee with progeny, with riches; do thou, being girded,  
win (*ā-san*) this strength (? *vā́ja*).

### Notes
TS. (iii. 5. 6¹) has a corresponding verse, of which this seems an  
artificial variation: *sáṁ tvā nahyāmi páyasā ghṛténa s. t. n. apá  
óṣadhībhiḥ: s. t. n. prajáyā ’hám adyá sā́ dīkṣitā́ sanavo vā́jam asmé*.  
⌊Cf. MGS. i. 11. 6 (with *adbhís* for *apás*), and p. 156.⌋ Kāuś. 76. 7  
uses the verse (with 1. 42) at the girding of the bride.

With all the milk that is in Earth I gird thee, with all the milk that Plants contain I dress thee. I gird thee round with children and with riches. Do thou, thus girt, receive the offered treasure.
