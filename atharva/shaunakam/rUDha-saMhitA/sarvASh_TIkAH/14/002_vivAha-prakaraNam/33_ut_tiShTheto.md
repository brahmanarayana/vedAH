### Translation
33. Stand up from here, O Viśvāvasu; with homage do we praise thee; seek  
thou a sister (*jāmí*) sitting among the Fathers, inserted (?  
*nyàktām*); that is thy portion by right of birth; know thou that.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
This verse corresponds to RV. x. 85. 22 **a, b** and 21 **c, d**; but  
RV. reads at the beginning *úd īrṣvā́ ’to viś-*; and in **c** *anyā́m* for  
*jāmím*, and *vyàktām* for *nyàktām*, which seems a mere ignorant  
substitution for it. Our mss. are divided between *nyàktam* and *-tām;*  
I.E.p.m.O.s.m.R.T.D.K. give *-tām*, which ending is doubtless to be  
accepted as the true reading. Ppp. reads with RV. at the beginning, but  
goes on independently: *ud īrṣvā ’taṣ patī hy eṣāṁ viśvāvasuṁ namasā  
gīrbhir īḍe*. The Āpast. text (Wint., p. 89 ⌊MP. i. 10. 1-2⌋) reads  
*vittām* for *vyaktām*. Compare Hillebrandt also in ZDMG. xl. 711; he  
renders *vyàktām* simply by 'bride,' one does not see why. ⌊Cf. also  
*Ved. Mythol.* i. 435.⌋ ⌊For the metrical definitions of the Anukr., see  
above.⌋

Rise and go hence, Visvavasu: with reverence we worship thee. Steal to her sister dwelling with her father: this is the share-- mark this--of old assigned thee.
