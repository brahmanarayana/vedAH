### Translation
25. Let there come forth (*vi-sthā*) from the lap of this mother animals  
(*paśú*) of various forms, being born; as one of excellent omen, sit  
thou by this fire; with thy husband (*sámpatnī*), be thou serviceable to  
the gods here.

### Notes
In Kāuś. 78. 9 this verse accompanies the removal of the boy again from  
the bride's lap. The verse is a pure *triṣṭubh*. ⌊W. pencils the note  
"cf. K. xxxix. 10."⌋

Let many babes of varied form and nature spring in succession from this fruitful mother. Wait on this fire, thou bringer of good fortune. Here with thy husband serve the Gods with worship.
