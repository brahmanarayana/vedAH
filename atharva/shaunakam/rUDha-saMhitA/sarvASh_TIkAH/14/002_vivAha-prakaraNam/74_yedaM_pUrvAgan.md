### Translation
74. She who hath come hither before, girdling herself (?), having given  
to this woman here progeny and property—her let them carry along the  
road of what is not gone; this one, a *virā́j*, having good progeny, hath  
conquered.

### Notes
This obscure verse is not made clear by Kāuś. 77. 4; though the latter  
perhaps means it to be used if another bridal procession goes athwart  
the track at a cross-roads. The *pada*-text in a divides without any  
reason *raśanā॰yámānā*. Perhaps, too, we ought to resolve *pū́rvā́gan*  
into *pū́rvā: ā॰ágan*, instead of *pū́rvā: ágan*, as the p. does. The  
third pāda is perhaps a mere ill-wish with contempt: 'she may go to  
grass.' Ppp. reads in **b** *dhattām*, in **c** *abhi* for *anu*, and  
combines in **d** *suprajā ’ty-*. ⌊For consistency, the Berlin text  
should have dattvā́.⌋

Her who first guided by a rein came hither, giving the bride, here offspring and possessions, Let them convey along the future's pathway. Splendid, with noble children, she hath conquered.
