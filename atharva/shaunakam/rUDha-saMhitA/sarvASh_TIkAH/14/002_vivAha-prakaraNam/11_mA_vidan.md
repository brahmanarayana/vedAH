### Translation
11. Let not the waylayers who pursue (*ā-sad*) \[them\] find the two  
spouses; let them go over what is difficult by an easy \[road\]; let the  
niggards run away.

### Notes
Is RV. x. 85. 32, whose only variant is *sugébhis* in **c**. We had  
**a** as xii. 1. 32 **d**, and **d** as vi. 129. 1-3 **d**. MB. (i. 3.  
12) and Āpast. (Wint., p. 67 ⌊MP. i. 6. 10⌋) have the RV. reading. The  
verse is used (Kāuś. 77. 3), with 1. 34, when the bridal train starts.  
⌊The Anukr. calls the vs. *dampatyoḥ paripatithināśanī*⌋.

Let not the highway thieves who lie in ambush find the wedded pair. Let wicked men's malignities go elsewhere by an easy path.
