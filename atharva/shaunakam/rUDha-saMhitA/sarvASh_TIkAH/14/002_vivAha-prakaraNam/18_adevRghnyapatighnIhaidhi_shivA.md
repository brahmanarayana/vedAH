### Translation
18. Not brother-in-law-slaying, not husband-slaying be thou here,  
propitious to the cattle, of easy control, very splendid, having  
progeny, hero-bearing, loving brothers-in-law (?), pleasant, do thou  
worship (*sapary*) this householder's fire.

### Notes
Our mss. differ, as in the preceding verse, between *devṛ́kāmā* and  
*devák-* in **c**. The first three pādas agree nearly with RV. x. 85. 44  
**a-c**, but the latter begins **a** with *ághoracakṣus* (like our 17  
**a**) ⌊and omits *ihá*⌋, reads *sumánās* instead of *suyámā* in **b**,  
and in **c** omits *prajā́vatī* and gives *devákāmā;* its fourth pāda is  
the commonplace phrase *śáṁ no bhava dvipáde śáṁ cátuṣpade*. Ppp. reads  
for **a, b**: *adevaraghni patiraghny edhi syonaṣ paśubhyas sumanas  
suvīraḥ;* and, for **c, d** (given, as noted above, as second half of  
the preceding verse): *prajāvatī vīrasūr devṛkāme ’mam agn-* etc.; it  
thus gets rid of the *syonā* whose apparent intrusion spoils the  
*triṣṭubh*-character of our **c, d**. ⌊The ms. reckons *syonā́* to **d**  
(by placing the mark of pāda-division before it); but the integrity of  
*imám* etc. as a pāda (without *syonā́*) is palpable. Likely our text  
represents a blend of two readings: *vīrasū́ur devákāmā sionā́* (RV.), and  
*prajā́vatī vīrasū́r devṛ́kāmā* (Ppp.): cf. under vs. 17.—Perhaps the  
corruption at xviii. 1. 39 below is in part due to a confused blending  
of two readings.⌋

No slayer of thy husband or his father, gentle and bright, bring blessing on the cattle. Loving thy husband's father, bring forth heroes. Tend well this household fire: be soft and pleasant.
