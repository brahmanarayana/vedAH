### Translation
20. When this bride hath worshiped the householder's, the former  
(*pū́rva*) fire, then, O woman, do thou pay homage to Sarasvatī and to  
the Fathers.

### Notes
Ppp. (which not rarely substitutes *āi* for *ī*) seems to agree with all  
our mss. in reading *asaparyāit* ⌊see the note to vi. 32. 2⌋. Prāt. ii.  
65 prescribes the combination *námas k-* in **d**. The first pāda (10  
syll.) is both irregular and defective. By Kāuś. 77. 23, the ver.se,  
with vs. 46 below, is to accompany the homage paid by the bride to the  
deities mentioned.

As first of all this woman hath adored the sacred household fire. So do thou, Dame, pay homage to the Fathers and Sarasvati.
