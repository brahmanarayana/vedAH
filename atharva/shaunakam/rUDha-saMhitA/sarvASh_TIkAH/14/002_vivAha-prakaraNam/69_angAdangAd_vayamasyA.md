### Translation
69. Away from every limb of her do we deposit the *yákṣma;* let that not  
attain (*pra-āp*) the earth nor the gods; let it not attain the heaven,  
the wide atmosphere; let that defilement not attain the waters, O Agni;  
let it not attain Yama and all the Fathers.

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **a, b** *yo ‘yam asyām upa yakṣmaṁ ni dhatta naḥ*. Kāuś.  
76. 14 uses the verse to accompany the purifying of the bride. The  
metrical structure (8 + 8: 11 + 11: 11 + 11 = 60) is described as well  
as the Anukr. knows how.

We take away consumption from each limb and member of the bride. Let not this reach Earth, nor the Gods in heaven, let it not reach the sky or air's wide region. Let not this dust that sullies reach the Waters, nor Yama, Agni, nor the host of Fathers.
