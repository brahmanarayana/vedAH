### Translation
43. Awaking out of a pleasant lair (*yóni*), mightily enjoying  
yourselves, merry, having good kine, good sons, good houses, may ye,  
living, pass the outshining dawns.

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **c, d** *subhāu suputrāu sukṛtāu carātāu jīvā uṣ-*; our  
P.M.W. have *carātho*. To accent *tárāthas*, counting it to **d**  
instead of **c**, would be an improvement. The verse (which scans 11 +  
11: 8 + 11 or 11 + 8 = 41) is very ill described by the Anukr. According  
to Kāuś. 79. 12, it accompanies the rising from the nuptial bed.

On your soft couch awaking both together, revelling heartily with joy and laughter, Rich with brave sons, good cattle, goodly homestead, live long to look on many radiant mornings.
