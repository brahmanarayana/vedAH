### Translation
7. What herbs \[there are\], what streams, what fields, what forests—let  
these, O bride, defend from the demon thee, possessing progeny, for thy  
husband.

### Notes
The Āpast. text (Wint., p. 70 ⌊MP. i. 7. 9⌋) has the same verse, but  
with different readings: for **b**, *yā́ni dhánvāni yé vánāḥ* ⌊Oxford  
text *vánā*⌋ in **c**, *té* for *tā́s;* for **d**, *prá tvé muñcantv  
áṅhasaḥ*. Kāuś. 77. 11 uses it on the bridal journey 'under the  
circumstances mentioned in the verse.'
