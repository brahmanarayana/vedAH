### Comment
The Anukramaṇī, as we have it, omits the description of several of the verses (26, 34, 36, 38, 47, 50, 68); ⌊and, on the other hand, it defines verses 13 and 33 each twice, each once right and once wrong;⌋ and it mixes the order of others ⌊compare Whitney's remarks, above, page 739, If ¶3, and mine, page 740, top⌋.


The verses (except 50, 58) of this anuvāka or hymn are found also in Pāipp. xviii. (for slight differences of order, see under the verses). ⌊About a dozen verses of this anuvāka or hymn also occur in the RV. wedding-hymn, x. 85.⌋ Only one verse (47) is used by Vāit., but nearly all by Kāuś.


### Translations
Translated: parts, of course, by the RV. translators; and the parts peculiar to our text by Ludwig, p. 472; and, as AV. hymn, by Weber (as above), Ind. Stud. v. 204-217. For vss. 59-62, see Bloomfield, AJP. xi. 336-341, or JAOS. xv., p. xliv, = PAOS. for Oct. 1890.
