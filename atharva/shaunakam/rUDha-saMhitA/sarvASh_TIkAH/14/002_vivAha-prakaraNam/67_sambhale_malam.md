### Translation
67. Having settled the defilement on the wooer, the difficulty on the  
dress, we have become worshipful, cleansed (*śudh*); may he extend our  
life-times.

### Notes
Ppp. also has this time *sambhale* in **a**; in **d**, it combines *nā  
”yūnṣi* and reads *tāriṣam*. ⌊Here, as at iv. 10. 6 and ii. 4. 6: see  
notes,⌋ part of our mss. (Bs.E.O.D.) read *tārṣat*. With the verse  
compare xii. 2. 20 above. The Anukr. passes without notice the extra  
syllable in **a**.
