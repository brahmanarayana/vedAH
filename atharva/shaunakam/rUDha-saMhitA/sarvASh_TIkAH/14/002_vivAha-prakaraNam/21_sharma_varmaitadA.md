### Translation
21. Take this protection, defense, to spread under this woman; O  
Sinīvālī, let her have progeny; may she be in the favor of Bhaga.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The second half-verse is the same with 15 **c, d** above. The rendering  
implies ⌊after *nā́ryāi* in **b**⌋ an emendation to *upastíre*  
(infinitive), which is the reading of Ppp. The Āpast. text (Wint., p. 71  
⌊MP. i. 8. 1⌋) also has it; further, in **a** it has *idám ā́ bhara*,  
and, in **d**, *iyám* inserted before *bhágasya*. In Kāuś. 78. 1, the  
verse is directed to be uttered while he (the bridegroom?) brings the  
hide of a red ox.

Take thou this wrapper as a screen, to be a covering for the bride O Sinivali, let her bear children, and live in Bhaga's grace.
