### Translation
51. What ends \[there are\], how many edges (*síc*), what webs, and what  
lines; what garment woven by the spouses—may that touch us pleasantly.

### Notes
More lit., '\[as\] a pleasant one.' With this verse, according to Kāuś.  
79. 26, the new possessor of the garment puts it on, then coming back  
with vs. 44. The Anukr. notices this time the redundant syllable in  
**b** (we are doubtless to contract to *yāú ’tavo*). Ppp. reads, for  
**c, d**, *vāso yat patnībhṛtaṁ tanvā syonam upa spṛśaḥ*.

May all the hems and borders all the threads that form the web and woof. The garment woven by the bride, be soft and pleasant to our touch.
