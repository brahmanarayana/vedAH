### Translation
40. Let Prajāpati generate progeny for you (two); let Aryaman unite  
(*sam-añj*) \[you\] with days-and-nights; not ill-omened, enter thou  
this world of thy husband; be weal to our bipeds, weal to \[our\]  
quadrupeds.

### Notes
The verse is RV. x. 85. 43, which, however, begins **a** with *ā́ naḥ  
pr-*, **b** with *ājarasā́ya*, and **c** with *ádurman̄galīḥ p-*. Ppp.  
also reads the latter (*-līṣ p-*); and, in **d**, *astu* for *bhana*.  
RV. further omits *imám* in **c**. ⌊MB. at i. 2. 18 follows RV.⌋ The  
Āpast. text (Wint., p. 90 ⌊MP. i. 11, 5⌋) has precisely the RV. version.  
MS. (ii. 13. 23) has pāda *a* only. The verse is almost a good jagatī,  
only a little damaged by the intrusion of *imam* in **c**; ⌊and a  
perfect *jagatī*, if (with RV. MB. MP.) we omit *imam*⌋.

So may the Lord of Life vouchsafe you children, Aryaman bind you, day and night, together. Enter thy husband's house with happy omens, bring blessing to our quadrupeds and bipeds.
