### Translation
10. What *yákṣmas* go to the bride's brilliant (*candrá*) car among the  
people, let the worshipful gods conduct those back whence they came.

### Notes
The verse is RV. x. 85. 31; RV. reads in **b** *jánād ánu*. The Āpast.  
text (Wint., p. 67 ⌊MP. i. 6. 9⌋) has the same verse. ⌊The Anukr. calls  
the vs. *yakṣmanāśanī*.⌋

Consumptions, which, through various folk, attack the bride's resplendent train, These let the holy Gods again bear to the place from which they sprang.
