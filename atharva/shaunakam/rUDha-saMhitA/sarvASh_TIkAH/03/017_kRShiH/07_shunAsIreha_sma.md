### Translation
7. O śunāsīrā, do ye (two) enjoy me here; what milk ye have made in  
heaven, therewith pour ye upon this \[furrow\].

### Notes
'Milk,' i.e. nourishing fluid. Weber implies at the end "earth" (instead  
of "furrow"), which is perhaps to be preferred. RV. (iv. 57. 5) reads  
for **a** *śúnāsīrāv imā́ṁ vā́caṁ ju-;* TA. (as above) the same, except  
that it strangely omits the verb, and thus reduces the *triṣṭubh* pāda  
to a *gāyatrī;* both texts mark the principal pāda-division after **b**.  
The comm. changes all the three verbs to 3d dual. The Anukr. forbids in  
**a** the resolution *-sīrā ihá*. In our edition the verse is numbered  
6, instead of 7.

Suna and Sira, welcome ye this laud, and with the milk that ye have made in heaven, Bedew ye both this earth of ours.
