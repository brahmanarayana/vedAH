### Translation
8. O furrow, we reverence thee; be \[turned\] hitherward, O fortunate  
one, that thou mayest be well-willing to us, that thou mayest become of  
good fruit for us.

### Notes
RV. (iv. 57. 6) inverts the order of **a** and **b**, and both it and  
TA. (as above) end **c** and **d** respectively with *subhágā́ ’sasi* and  
*suphálā́ ’sasi*. All the pāda-mss. have the blundering reading  
*su॰phalā́ḥ* in **d**. The Anukr. perversely refuses to make the  
resolution *tu-ā* in **a**.

Auspicious Sita, come thou near: we venerate and worship thee. That thou mayst bless and prosper us and bring us fruits abundantly.
