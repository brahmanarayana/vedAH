### Translation
5. Successfully (*śunám*) let the good plowshares thrust apart the  
earth; successfully let the plowmen follow the beasts of draft; O  
śunāsīrā, do ye (two), dripping (?) with oblation, make the herbs rich  
in berries for this man.

### Notes
VS. (xii. 69) and MS. (ii. 7. 12) have the whole of this verse; RV. (iv.  
57. 8) and TS. (iv. 2. 5⁶), only the first two pādas. For *suphālā́s* in  
**a**, VS. (also our I.) has *sú phā́lās*, and RV.TS. *naḥ phā́lās*, both  
preferable readings; RV.VS. have *kṛṣantu* for *tudantu*. In **b**, TS.  
gives *abhí* for *ánu* (our P.M. have *ábhínu*); MS. has *kinā́śo abhy  
ètu vāhāíḥ;* RV.VS., *-śā abhí yantu vāhāíḥ*. In **c**, the comm. gives  
*toṣamāṇā*, explaining it by *tuṣyantāu*. In **d**, the mss. vary (as  
everywhere where the word occurs) between *-pippalā́s* and *-piṣpalā́s;*  
about half are for each; VS. MS. end the pāda with *kartanā ’smé*. Ppp.  
has a peculiar version: *śunaṁ kenāśo anv etu vāhaṁ śunaṁ phālo vinadann  
ayatu bhūmim: śunāsīrā haviṣā yo yajātrāi supippalā oṣadhayas santu  
tasmāi.* The comm. ⌊quoting Yaska⌋ declares *śunāsīrāu* to be Vāyu and  
Āditya (wind and sun); or else, he says, *śuna* is god of happiness and  
*Sīra* of the plow.

Happily let the shares turn up the ploughland, the ploughers happily follow the oxen. Pleased with our sacrifice, Suna and Sira! make the plants bring this man abundant produce.
