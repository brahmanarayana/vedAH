### Translation
6. Successfully let the draft-animals, successfully the men,  
successfully let the plow (*lā́n̄gala*) plow; successfully let the straps  
be bound; successfully do thou brandish the goad.

### Notes
This is RV. iv. 57. 4, without variation; it is also found, with the two  
following verses, in TA. (vi. 6. 2, vss. 6-8), which reads *nārā́s*  
instead of *náras* at end of **a**. Part of our mss. (P.M.W.E.) have  
*úṣṭrām* in **d**. The comm. declares śuna to be addressed in the last  
pāda. Ppp. has in xii. *śunaṁ vṛtrām āyaccha śunam aṣṭrām ud in̄gayaḥ  
śunaṁ tu tapyatāṁ phālaś śunaṁ vahatu lān̄galam;* and in xix. the same  
**a, b** ⌊ending *-ya*⌋, but, for **c, d**, *śunaṁ vahasya śuklasyā  
’ṣṭrayā jahi dakṣiṇam*.

Happily work our steers and men! May the plough furrow happily, Happily be the traces bound. Happily ply the driving-goad.
