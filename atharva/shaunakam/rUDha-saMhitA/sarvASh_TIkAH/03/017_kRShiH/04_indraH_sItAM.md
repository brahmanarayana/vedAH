### Translation
4. Let Indra hold down the furrow; let Pūshan defend it; let it, rich in  
milk, yield to us each further summer.

### Notes
This verse is found only in RV. (iv. 57. 7), which reads *ánu yachatu*  
for *abhí rakșatu;* Ppp. has *mahyaṁ* instead of *abhi*. We had the  
second half-verse above, as iii. 10. 1 **c, d**.

May Indra press the furrow down, may Pushan guard and cherish her. May she, well stored with milk yield milk for us through each succeeding year.
