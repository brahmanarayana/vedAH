### Translation
9. Appeased is the flesh-eating, appeased the men-injuring fire; so also  
the one that is of all conflagrations, him, the flesh-eating, have I  
appeased.

### Notes
Ppp. has *atho puruṣareṣiṇaḥ* for **b**, and this time *viśvadavyas* in  
**c**. The *anuṣṭubh* is rather *virāj* than *nicṛt*.

Flesh-eating Agni is appeased, appeased is he who hurteth men. Now him who burneth every thing, the Flesh-consumer, have I stilled.
