### Translation
4. He who is the all-eating god, and whom they call Desire (*kā́ma*),  
whom they call giver, receiving one, who is wise, mighty, encompassing,  
unharmable—to those fires be this oblation made.

### Notes
MS. begins the verse with *viśvā́dam agním;* K., with *hutādam agnim;* of  
**b**, both spoil the meter by reading *pratigrahītā́ram;* MS. begins  
**c** with *dhī́ro yáḥ;* K's **c** is corrupt. Ppp. reads *āha* for  
*āhus* in **a** (not in **b** also). The comm. simply paraphrases  
*pratigṛhṇántam* by *pratigrahītī́ram;* the reference is probably to the  
offerings which Agni receives in order to give them to the various  
gods. In our edition, an accent-mark belonging under *ā* of *āhús* in  
**a** has slipped aside to the left.
