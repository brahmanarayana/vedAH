### Translation
6. Attach yourselves, O kine, to me as lord of kine; this your stall  
here \[be\] flourishing; to you, becoming numerous with abundance of  
wealth, to you living, may we living be near (*upa-sad*).

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
*Bhávantas* in **c** would be a desirable emendation. *Upa-sad* may be  
rather 'wait upon' (so Grill), only then we should expect rather  
*sadāma* (comm., *upagacchema*). ⌊W's implied difference between  
*sadema* and *sadāma* is not clear to me.⌋ Ppp. reads in **a**  
*gopatyā*, and its **b** is *mayi vo goṣṭha iha poṣayāti.* ⌊The epithet  
*ārṣī* seems to be as meaningless here as at iii. 12. 7—see note, end.⌋
