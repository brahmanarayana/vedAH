### Translation
3. Having come together, iinaffrighted, rich in manure, in this stall,  
bearing the sweet of soma, come ye hither, free from disease.

### Notes
Three of the pādas (**a, b, d**) again form, with considerable variants,  
a *gāyatrī* in MS. (ibid.) immediately following the one noted above:  
MS. has *ávihrutās* for *ábibhyuṣīs*, *purīṣíṇīs* for *kar-*, and, in  
place of our **d**, *svāveśā́ na ā́ gata.* Ppp. gives, as not seldom, in  
part the MS. readings, corrupted: it begins *saṁjanānāṁ vihṛtām*, has  
*havis* for *madhu* in **c**, and, for **d**, *svāveśāsa etana*. The  
combination of p. *upa॰étana* into s. *upétana* is one of those aimed at  
by Prāt. iii. 52, according to the comment on that rule; but it would  
equally well fall under the general rule (iii. 38) as to the order of  
combination when *ā* comes between two vowels (*upa-ā-itana* like  
*indra-ā-ihi* etc.). ⌊Cf. also Lanman, JAOS. x. 425.⌋
