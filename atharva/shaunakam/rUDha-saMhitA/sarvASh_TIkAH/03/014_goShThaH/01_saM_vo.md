### Translation
1. With a comfortable (*suṣád*) stall, with wealth, with well-being,  
with that which is the name of the day-born one, do we unite you.

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **b** *sapuṣṭyā* for *subhūtyā.* The obscure third pāda is  
found again below as v. 28. 12 **c**; it is altogether diversely  
rendered (conjecturally) by the translators (Weber, "with the blessing  
of favorable birth"; Ludwig, "with \[all\] that which one calls  
day-born"; Grill, "with whatever a day of luck brings forth"); R.  
suggests "with all (of good things) that the day brings, or that is  
under the heaven": none of these suits the other occurrence.
