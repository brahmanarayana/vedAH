### Translation
2. Let Aryaman unite you, let Pūshan, let Brihaspati, let Indra, who is  
conqueror of riches; in my possession gain ye what is good.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
'In my possession,' lit. 'with me' (bei mir, chez moi). The comm. takes  
*puṣyata* as = *poṣayata;* and so do the translators, unnecessarily and  
therefore inadmissibly; or, we may emend to *puṣyatu*, with *vásu* as  
subject. "Unite" calls for the expression of with what; this is not  
given, but the verse may be regarded as (except **d**) a continuation of  
vs. 1. The three pādas **a-c** are found as a *gāyatrī*-verse in MS.  
(iv. 2. 10: with *poṣā́* for *pūṣā́* in **b**). Ppp. has *iha puṣyati* at  
beginning of **d**.
