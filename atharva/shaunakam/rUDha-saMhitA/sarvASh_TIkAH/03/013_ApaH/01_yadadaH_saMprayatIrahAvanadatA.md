### Translation
1. Since formerly (? *adás*), going forth together, ye resounded  
(*nad*) when the dragon was slain, thenceforth ye are streams (*nadī́*)  
by name: these are your names, O rivers.

### Notes
The *pada*-mss. all commit the very gratuitous blunder of writing *tā́ḥ*  
instead of *tā́* at the beginning of **d**, as if it belonged to  
*sindhavas* instead of to *nā́māni;* SPP. emends to *tā́*, and the comm.  
so understands the word. The comm. takes *adás* as Vedic substitute for  
*amuṣmin*, qualifying *áhāu.* None of the other texts gives any various  
reading for this verse. Pāda **d** sets forth, as it were, the office of  
the first four verses, in finding punning etymologies for sundry of the  
names of water.

As ye, when Ahi had been slain, flowed forth together with a roar, So are ye called the Roaring Ones: this, O ye Rivers, is your name.
