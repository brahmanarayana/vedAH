### Translation
6. Then indeed I see, or also hear; unto me comes the noise, to me the  
voice of them; I think myself then to have partaken ambrosia (*amṛ́ta*)  
when, ye gold-colored ones, I have enjoyed (*tṛp*) you.

### Notes
TS. has the inferior readings *nas* for *mā* at end of **b** and *yád*  
for *yadā́* in **d**. MS. is corrupt in **b**; its *pada*-text reads  
*vā́k: nu: āsām*, but the editor gives in *saṁhitā*-text *vā́r nv āsām.*  
The comm. combines *vā́g mā.* Ppp. has at the beginning *yād* for *ād.*  
The comm. takes the opportunity of the occurrence of *hiraṇya-* in **d**  
to bring forward an etymology of it which he here and there repeats; it  
is *hita-ramaṇīya!* The verse is improperly reckoned as *nicṛt*. ⌊In the  
edition *amṛ́tastha* is a misprint for *-sya.*⌋
