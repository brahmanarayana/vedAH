### Translation
1. Sharpened up is this incantation (? *bráhman*) of mine; sharpened up  
\[my\] heroism, strength; sharpened up, victorious, be the unwasting  
authority (*kṣatrá*) \[of them\] of whom I am the household priest  
(*puróhita*).

### Notes
Or *bráhman* and *kṣatrám* may signify respectively the Brāhman and  
Kṣatriya quality or dignity of the *puróhita* and his constituency. The  
verse is found also in VS. (xi. 81), TS. (iv. 1. 10³), TA. (ii. 5. 2,  
vs. 15), MS. (ii. 7. 7), and K. (xvi. 7, Weber). The first two of these  
agree in all their readings, omitting *idám* in **a** and *ajáram astu*  
in **c**, and reading in **c, d** *jiṣṇú yásyā ’hám ásmi;* and TA.MS.  
differ from them only by adding *me* before *jiṣṇú;* Ppp. has *kṣatraṁ  
me jiṣṇu*, but agrees with our text in **d**. The comm. moreover has  
*jiṣṇu*, and the translation implies it; *jiṣṇús* can only be regarded  
as a blunder. Ppp. further gives *mayī ’dam* for *ma idam* in **a**, and  
*mama* for *balam* in **b**. Our original **c** has apparently got  
itself mixed up with vs. 5 **c**.
