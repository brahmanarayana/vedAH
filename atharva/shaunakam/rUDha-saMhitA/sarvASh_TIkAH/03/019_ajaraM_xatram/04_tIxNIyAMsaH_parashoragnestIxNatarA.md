### Translation
4. Sharper than an ax, also sharper than fire, sharper than Indra's  
thunderbolt—\[they\] of whom I am the household priest.

### Notes
Emendation to *indravajrā́t* would rectify the meter of **c**; but the  
Anukr. apparently accepts the redundancy there as balancing the  
deficiency in **a**.

Keener than is the axe's edge, keener than Agni's self are they, Keener than Indra's bolt are they whose Priest and President am I.
