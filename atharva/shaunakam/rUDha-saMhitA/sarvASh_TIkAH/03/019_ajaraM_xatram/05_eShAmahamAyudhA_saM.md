### Translation
5. The weapons of them I sharpen up; their royalty having good heroes, I  
increase; be their authority unwasting, victorious; their intent let all  
the gods aid.

### Notes
The translation again (as in vs. 2) implies emendation of *syāmi* in  
**a** to *śyāmi*, which is read by Ppp. and by the comm. Most of our  
mss. (all save O.Op.), as of SPP's, accent in **b** *súvīram*, and both  
editions have adopted the reading; but it ought, of course, to be  
*suvī́ram*, as always elsewhere (and as the comm. here describes the  
word). Ppp. has *vardhayasva* at end of **b**, and its **d** is *ugram  
eṣāṁ cittaṁ bahudhā viśvarūpā*. The definition of the verse as  
*triṣṭubh* is wanting in the Anukr. ⌊London ms.⌋, doubtless by an error  
of the manuscripts, which are confused at this point. ⌊The Berlin ms.  
does give it.⌋

The weapons of these men I whet and sharpen, with valiant heroes I increase their kingdom. Victorious be their power and ever ageless! May all the Gods promote their thoughts and wishes.
