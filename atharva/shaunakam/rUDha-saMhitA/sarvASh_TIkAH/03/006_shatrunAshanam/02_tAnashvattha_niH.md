### Translation
2. Crush them out, O *aśvatthá*, our violent foes, O expelling one,  
allied with Vṛtra-slaying Indra, with Mitra, and with Varuṇa.

### Notes
The translation implies the reading of *vāibādha* in **b** as an  
independent word; it is so regarded by BR., Weber, the later  
translators, and the comm.; all the *pada*-mss. make it into a compound  
with *dódhatas*, and both editions so write it. Ppp. reads instead, for  
**b**, *śatrūn mayi bādha todhata.* Some of our mss. (P.M.W.E.) read in  
**a** *ní śṛ-;* one of SPP's has *sṛṇīhi.* The comm. explains *dódhatas*  
as *bhṛśaṁ kampayitṝn;* ⌊but see *Ved. Stud.* ii. 10⌋.  
  
Ppp. adds a verse of its own: *yathā ’śvattha niṣṇāmi pūrvāṅ jātān utā  
’parān* (cf. x. 3. 13-15): *evā pṛdanyatas tvam abhi tiṣṭha sahasvatā.*
