### Translation
6. As, O *aśvatthá*, ascending them of the forest-trees, thou dost put  
them beneath thee (*ádhara*), so the head of my foe do thou split apart  
and overcome.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Ppp. (as we saw above) has the second half of this verse, with variants,  
as its 3 **c, d**. What the *vānaspatyá* is, as distinguished from  
*vánaspáti*, is as obscure as the similar relation of *rtú* and *ārtavá*  
⌊iii. 10. 9 note⌋; possibly 'they of that sort, they and their kind';  
our translation marks, rather mechanically, the distinction. The comm.  
says that here *vanaspati* means "the place where trees grow," and  
*vānaspatya* the trees themselves—which is an explanation quite after  
his kind.

As thou, Asvastha!, mountest on the trees and overthrowest them, So do thou break my foeman's head asunder and o'erpower him.
