### Translation
5. Let perdition bind them, with unreleasable fetters of death—my foes,  
O *aśvatthá*, whom I hate and who \[hate\] me.

### Notes
Ppp. has *avimokyāis* in **b**, and (as in vs. I ) begins **d** with  
*yāṅś cā ’ham.* Several of our mss, (P.M.W.E.) have at the beginning the  
senseless reading *simātu.*

Nirriti bind them with the bonds of Death which never may be loosed. Mine enemies, Asvattha! those who hate me and whom I detest.
