### Translation
1. The male (*púmāṅs*) \[is\] born out of the male—the *aśvatthá* forth  
from the *khadirá;* let it smite my foes, whom I hate and who \[hate\]  
me.

### Notes
A very acceptable emendation would be *pári jātás*, since *pári* is  
plainly accessory to the ablative *puṁsás*, as *ádhi* to *khadirā́t* in  
**b** (cf. *ásatas pári jajñiré*, x. 7. 25). Ppp. retains the initial  
*a* of *aśvatthas*, and begins **d** with *yāṅś cā ’ham.* The *aśvattha*  
begins as a parasite, usually on the *śamī* (fem.), this time from the  
hard *khadira* (masc).

Masculine springs from masculine, Asvattha grows from Kha- dira, May it destroy mine enemies, who hate me and whom I detest.
