### Translation
7. Let them float forth downward, like a boat severed from its mooring  
(*bándhana*); of them, thrust forth by the expelling one, there is no  
returning again.

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **c** *nurbādha;* our Op. has *vāibādhá:* *pra॰nuttānām.*  
*Astu* in **d**, for *asti*, would be an improvement. The comm. gives a  
double explanation of *bandhana*, as either place or instrument of  
fastening. ⌊The vs. recurs at ix. 2. 12, with *sā́yaka-* for  
*vāibādhá-.*—W's collation of Op. gives *pra॰*, not *prá॰*!⌋

Let them drift downward like a boat torn from the rope that fastened it. There is no turning back for those whom He who Cleaves hath driven away.
