### Translation
2. The many roads, travelled by the gods, that go about (*sam-car*)  
between heaven-and-earth—let them enjoy me with milk, with ghee, that  
dealing (*krī*) I may get (*ā-hṛ*) riches.

### Notes
Ppp's version is very different: *ihāi ’vaṣ panthā bahavo devayānām anu  
dyāvāpṛthivī supraṇītiḥ: teṣām ahnāṁ varcasy ā dadhāmi yathā klītvā  
dhanatn āvahāni.* The comm. allows us alternatively to understand  
*deva-* in **a** as "by traders"; he renders *juṣantām* in **c** by  
*sevantām*, as if it were causative. His text has at the beginning *ye  
te panth-*. The emendation, suggested by Weber, of *mā* in **c** to *me*  
would help the sense. The first half-verse is found again below as vi.  
55. 1 **a, b.** To make a regular *triṣṭubh*, we must contract to  
*-pṛthvī́* in **b**, and expand to *krī-tu-ā́* in **d**; the Anukr.  
perhaps regards the two irregularities as balancing one another.

The many paths which Gods are wont to travel, the paths which go between the earth and heaven, May they rejoice with me in milk and fatness that I may make rich profit by my purchase.
