### Comment
Four of the verses are found in Pāipp. xix. (1, 4, 6, 2, in this order). The hymn is used by Kāuś. in a rite for good-fortune in trading (50. 12), and again (59. 6) for a similar purpose; also (or vs. 1) in the indramahotsava ceremony (140. 16); also vss. 7 and 8 in the appeasing of the flesh-eating fire (70. 13, 14). In Vāit. (6. 9), vs. 7 is employed in the ceremony of establishing the sacrificial fire. The usual statement of these various uses appears to be lacking in the manuscript of the comm., and is supplied, only in part, by its editor.
