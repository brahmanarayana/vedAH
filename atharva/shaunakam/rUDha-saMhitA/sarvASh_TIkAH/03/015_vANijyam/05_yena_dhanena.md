### Translation
5. With what riches I practise (*car*) bargaining, seeking riches with  
riches, ye gods—let that become more for me, not less; O Agni, put down  
(*ni-sidh*) with the oblation the gain-slaying gods.

### Notes
Or, possibly, 'the gods of the gain-slayer' (*sātaghnás* as gen. sing.;  
the comm. takes it as accus. pl., and Zimmer and Ludwig so translate).  
The omission of *devā́n* would rectify the meter and better the sense,  
and Weber and Grill ⌊and Hillebrandt⌋ leave it out. The Anukr. gives a  
mechanically correct definition of the verse as it stands.

The wealth wherewith I carry on my traffic, seeking, ye Gods! wealth with the wealth I offer, May this grow more for me, not less: O Agni, through sacrifice chase those who hinder profit!
