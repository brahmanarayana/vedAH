### Translation
8. Every day may we bring constantly for thee as for a standing horse, O  
Jātavedas; rejoicing together with abundance of wealth, with food, may  
we thy neighbors, O Agni, take no harm.

### Notes
The verse nearly accords with xix. 55. i, below; the second half is the  
same as there; the first half here is more unlike the parallel verse in  
other texts (VS. xi. 75; śB. vi. 6. 4. 1; TS. iv. i. 10¹; K. xvi. 7; MS.  
ii. 7. 7) than is xix. 55. 1 **ab**—see under xix. 55. 1; in the second  
half they vary only by putting *ágne* at the beginning of **d**; they  
make a more manageable sentence by furnishing an object, *ghāsám*  
'fodder,' for *bharema*. The comm. renders *tiṣṭhate* by *svagṛhe  
vartamānāya.*  
  
Here, at the end of the third *anuvāka*, of 5 hymns and 38 verses, the  
old Anukr. says simply *aṣṭāu* (but O.R. give *aṣṭatriṅśat*).  
  
The fifth *prapāṭhaka* also ends with this hymn.

Still to thee ever will we bring oblation, as to a stabled horse, O Jatavedas. Joying in food and in the growth of riches may we thy servants, Agni, never suffer.
