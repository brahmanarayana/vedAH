### Translation
3. With fuel, O Agni, with ghee, I, desiring, offer the oblation, in  
order to energy (*táras*), to strength;—revering with worship  
(*bráhman*), so far as I am able—this divine prayer (*dhī́*), in order to  
hundred-fold winning.

### Notes
The verse is RV. iii. 18. 3, without variant—save that RV. accents of  
course *juhómi*, as does our edition by necessary emendation, while SPP.  
follows all the mss. in giving *juhomi* (the *pada*-text puts a sign of  
pāda-division after the word, but also before it). The verse is not at  
all likely to have been an original part of our hymn; the word  
*śataséyāya* in **d** has caused its addition. The comm. renders  
*tárase* by *vegāya śīghragamanāya*, and applies *yā́vad ī́śe* in two  
ways, to the winning or to the worshipping.
