### Translation
3. The army of enemies, O bounteous one, playing the foe against us—do  
ye (two), O Vṛtra-slaying Indra, Agni also, burn against them.

### Notes
The verse is found also as SV. ii. 1215, which reads *chatruyatī́m* in  
**b**, and begins **c** with *ubhāú tā́m* (*tā́m* is read by the comm.,  
and is called for as an emendation in our verse); it also has the  
correct accent *amitrasenā́m*, which is found in only two of our mss. (O.  
Op.) and three of SPP's; both editions read *-sénām.* In our text,  
*āgníś* in **d** is a misprint for *agníś.* ⌊SPP. combines *asmā́n ch-*,  
badly: cf. i. 19. 4, note.⌋

O Maghavan, O Indra, thou who slayest fiends, and, Agni, thou, Burn, both of you, against these men, the foeman's host that threatens us.
