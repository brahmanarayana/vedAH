### Translation
1. Let Agni, knowing, go against our foes, burning against the  
imprecator, the niggard; let him confound (*mohaya-*) the army of our  
adversaries (*pára*); and may Jātavedas make them handless.

### Notes
Ppp. makes *śatrūn* and *vidvān* in **a** change places. SPP. reports  
that the text used by the comm. reads *ṇaḥ* after *agnir* both here and  
in 2. 1 **a**. The comm. signalizes the beginning of the book by giving  
absurd etymologies of *agni* at the length of nearly a page. Pāda **c**  
lacks a syllable, unless we allow ourselves to resolve *sé-na-ām.*
