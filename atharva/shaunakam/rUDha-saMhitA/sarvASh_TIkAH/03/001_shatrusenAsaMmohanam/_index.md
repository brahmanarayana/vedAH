### Comment
Found in Pāipp. iii., next after the one which here follows it. In Kāuś. (14. 17), this hymn and the next are called mohanāni 'confounders,' and are used in a rite (14. 17-21) for confounding an enemy's army; its details have nothing to do with those of the hymns.


### Translations
Translated: Ludwig, p. 518; Weber, xvii. 180; Griffith, i. 81; Bloomfield, 121, 325.
