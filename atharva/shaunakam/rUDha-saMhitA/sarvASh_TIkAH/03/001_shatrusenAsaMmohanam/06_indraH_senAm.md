### Translation
6. Let Indra confound the army; let the Maruts slay with force; let Agni  
take away its eyes; let it go back conquered.

### Notes
All the mss. read *índra*, vocative, at the beginning of the verse; but  
SPP's text, as well as ours, emends to *índraḥ s-;* and this the comm.  
also has. The comm. further in **c** *dhattām* instead of *dattām.*

Let Indra daze their army. Let the Maruts slay it with their might. Let Agni take their eyes away, and let the conquered host retreat.
