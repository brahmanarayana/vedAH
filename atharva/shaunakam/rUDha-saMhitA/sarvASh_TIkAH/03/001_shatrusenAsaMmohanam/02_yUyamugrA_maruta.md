### Translation
2. Ye, O Maruts, are formidable for such a plight; go forward upon  
\[them\], kill, overcome! The Vasus have killed \[them\]; suppliant  
\[are\] these; for let Agni, their messenger, go against \[their foes\],  
knowing.

### Notes
The second half-verse is rendered literally as it stands, but is  
certainly badly corrupt. Ppp. has *amīmṛcdaṁ vasavo nāthitebhyo agnir hy  
eṣāṁ vidvān pratyetu śatrūn*, which is much more acceptable: *nāth-*  
would be 'for \[us\] who supplicate.' *Dūtas* seems to have blundered in  
here out of 2. 1 **a**. Ludwig emends *nāthitā́s* to *-tā́n*, which would  
improve **c**, but leave it unconnected with **d**. In our edition  
*práty etu* is an erratum for *pratyétu*, which all the mss. read. The  
comm., with his customary neglect of accent, takes *ugrā́s* in **a** as  
vocative. He takes *īḍṛ́śe* as a locative (= *apradhṛsye saṁgrāmalakṣaṇe  
karmaṇi*), against the testimony of the other passages where the word  
occurs, and supplies *matsahāyās.* In **b**, he reads (with a couple of  
SPP's mss. that follow him) *mṛṇátas*, and takes it (again against the  
accent) as accus. pl. *Ámīmṛṇan* in **c** he renders as an imperative.  
The meter of the verse (11 + 11: 12 + 13 = 47) is capable of being  
fitted to the description of the Anukr. ⌊11 + 10: 12 + I2 = 45⌋ by duly  
managing the resolutions. ⌊Aufrecht, KZ. xxvii. 219 (1885), reconstructs  
the vs., putting *mṛḍáyata* for *mṛṇáta* in **b** and reading **c, d**  
thus: *ámīmṛḍan vásavo nāthitā́so agnír hí śatrū́n pratyéti vídhyan.* Cf.  
Bloomfield, 326.—Roth gives (in his notes) *mṛḍata* for *mṛṇata* and (in  
his collation) *yeṣām* for *hy eṣām*, as Ppp. readings.⌋

Mighty are ye for such a deed, O Maruts. Go forward, overcome them and destroy them. The Vasus slew, and these were left imploring. Wise Agni as our messenger assail them!
