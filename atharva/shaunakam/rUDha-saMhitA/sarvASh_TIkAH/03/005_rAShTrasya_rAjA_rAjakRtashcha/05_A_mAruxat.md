### Translation
5. The *parṇá*-amulet hath ascended me, in order to great unharmedness,  
so that I may be superior to patron (*aryamán*) and to ally (*saṁvíd*).

### Notes
*Saṁvíd* is here taken as corresponding noun to the common adjective  
*saṁvidāná* (the Pet. Lex., "possession"; Weber, "favor"); the comm.  
makes it *samānajñānāt* or *samabalāt;* and *aryaman*, according to him,  
comes from *arīn yamayati*, and means *adhikabalaḥ purupradātā ca*, Ppp.  
combines *mahyā ’riṣṭ-* in **b**, and has for **d** *manuṣyā adhi  
saṁśataḥ* (or *saṁmataḥ*). All the mss., and SPP's text, read *uttarás*  
in **c**; our *úttaras* is a necessary emendation. ⌊As to *aryamán*, cf.  
Weber's note.⌋

The Parna-Charm hath come to me for great security from ill. That I may be exalted, yea, above the wealth of Aryaman.
