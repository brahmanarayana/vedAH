### Translation
4. The *parṇá*, Soma's formidable power, hath come, given by Indra,  
governed (*śās*) by Varuṇa; may I, shining greatly, wear it in order to  
length of life for a hundred autumns.

### Notes
The translation implies emendation in **c** of the unmanageable  
*priyāsam* to *bhriyāsam*, an obvious improvement, adopted also by  
Weber, and supported by the reading of Ppp., *tam ahaṁ bibharmi;* the  
comm., too, though reading *priy-*, glosses it with *bhriyāsaṁ  
dhārayeyam.* In **b**, Ppp. has *sakhyas* for *śiṣṭas.* The comm. finds  
in *sómasya parṇás* in **a** allusion to the origin of the *parṇa*-tree  
from a leaf (*parṇa*) of soma, and quotes for it TS. iii. 5. 7¹.  
*Rócamānas* in **c** he uses as *nam*, qualifying *tám.* The metrical  
definition of the verse is wanting in the Anukr. mss.; we may call it a  
*nicṛt triṣṭubh.* ⌊See Weber's note on *parṇá.*⌋

As Indra's gift, by Varuna instructed, Parna hath come, the mighty strength of Soma: This would I, brightly shining, love and cherish for long life lasting through a hundred autumns.
