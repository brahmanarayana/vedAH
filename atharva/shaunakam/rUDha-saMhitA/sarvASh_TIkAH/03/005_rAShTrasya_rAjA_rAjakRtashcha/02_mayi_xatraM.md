### Translation
2. In me \[maintain\] dominion, O *parṇá*-amulet, in me maintain wealth;  
may I in the sphere of royalty be familiar (? *nijá*), supreme.

### Notes
Compare the nearly corresponding vi. 54. 2, which suggests emendation of  
*nijás* to *yujás* ⌊'may I be supreme above \[any\] ally or fellow-king'  
(*yujás* as abl.)⌋. Ppp. has *rāṣṭram* for *kṣatram* in **a**, and its  
**d** reads *yajā bhūyāsam uttarā*, supporting the emendation. Our Bp.  
reads in **c** *-vargré*, as some of the mss. do in the other  
occurrences of this obscure word: the comm. explains it by *āvarjane  
svādhīnī-karaṇe* 'appropriation,' and *nija* by *ananyasahāya.* ⌊BR.  
give 'beständig' for *nija.*⌋
