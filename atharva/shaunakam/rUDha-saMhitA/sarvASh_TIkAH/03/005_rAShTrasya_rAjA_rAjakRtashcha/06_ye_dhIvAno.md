### Translation
6. They that are clever chariot-makers, that are skilful smiths—subjects  
to me do thou, O *parṇá*, make all people (*jána*) round about.

### Notes
Ppp. begins *yat takṣāṇo rath-*, and its second half-verse is *sarvāṅs  
tvā ’nṛṇa randhayo ’pastiṁ kṛṇu medinam.* The comm. renders *dhīvānas*  
by *dhīvarā mātsikāḥ* 'fishermen,' and gives the technical definition of  
the caste of *rathakāras.* Weber (p. 196 ff.) treats with much fulness  
of these and other caste matters. *Upastīn* the comm. explains, nearly  
enough correctly, by *sevārthaṁ samīpe vidyamānān upāsīnām vā.*
