### Translation
7. They that are kings, king-makers, that are charioteers and  
troop-leaders—subjects to me do thou, O *parṇá*, make all people round  
about.

### Notes
Our Bp. reads in **b** *grāma॰ṇyàḥ*, emended to *॰nyàḥ;* Kp. has  
*grāmanyàḥ;* Op. and D. (and, so far as appears, all SPP's *pada*-mss.)  
*grāmaṇyàḥ;* the word is divided by the RV. *pada*-text (*grāma॰nī́ḥ*),  
as in all reason it should be; and its division seems favored, if not  
required, by our Prāt. iii. 76. Ppp. has a quite different text:  
*upastir astu vāiśya uta śūdra utā ”ryaḥ* for **a, b**, with **c, d** as  
in its version of vs. 6 (but with *tān ṛṇa* ⌊intending *tān parṇa?*⌋  
instead of *tvā ’nṛṇa*). Weber, on authority of śB. iii. 4. 1. 7,  
proposes to emend **a** to *yé ‘rājāno;* the comm. explains the  
*rā́jānas* by *anyadeśādhipāḥ;* and *rājakṛ́tas* by *rājye ‘bhiṣiñcanti  
’ti sacivāḥ.* ⌊In SPP's *Corrections* (to p. 364), his J. P. are  
reported as dividing *grāma॰nyàḥ.*⌋
