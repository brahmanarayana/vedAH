### Translation
6. The track (*padá*) of Idā \[is\] full of ghee, greatly trickling; O  
Jātavedas, accept thou the oblations. The cattle of the village that are  
of all forms—of those seven let the willing stay (*ráṁti*) be with me.

### Notes
Versions are found in AśS. (ii. 2. 17), ĀpśS. (vi. 5. 7), HGS. (ii. 17.  
2), and MB. (ii. 2. 14), and of the latter half in TA. (iii. 11. 12, vs.  
31 **a, c**). MB. agrees with our text throughout; the three others have  
*carācaram* at end of **a**, and all three *havir idaṁ juṣasva* (for  
*prati* etc.) in **b**; HGS. begins with *iḍāyāi sṛptam*, and ĀpśS.  
combines *iḍāyāḥ p-*; then, in **d**, ĀpśS., HGS., and TA. read *ihá*  
instead of *máyi;* and AśS. *puṣṭis* for *raṁtis;* HGS. ends with  
*raṁtir asiu puṣṭiḥ.* The comm. reads *ilāyās* in **a**; he renders  
*sarīsṛpam* by *atyarthaṁ sarpat*, *raṁtis* by *prītis*, and specifies  
the seven village (i.e. domestic) animals as cow, horse, goat, sheep,  
man, ass, camel; but the number seven is doubtless used only as an  
indefinite sacred one. Pada **a** is again *jagatī*, as in vs. 5. ⌊Pāda  
**c** is our ii. 34. 4 **a**; between *viśvarūpās* and *teṣām* ĀpśS.  
inserts *virūpās* (a fragment of our ii. 34. 4 **b**!).—Prāt. ii. 72  
requires *iḍāyās p-.*⌋

The shrine of Ila flows with oil and fatness: accept, O Jatavedas, our oblations. Tame animals of varied form and colour--may all the seven abide with me contented.
