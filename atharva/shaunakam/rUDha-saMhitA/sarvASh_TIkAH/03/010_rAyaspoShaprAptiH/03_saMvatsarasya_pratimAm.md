### Translation
3. Thou, O night, whom we worship (*upa-ās*) as model (*pratimā́*) of the  
year-—do thou unite our long-lived progeny with abundance of wealth.

### Notes
Or, perhaps better (so the comm. and Weber), 'do thou \[give\] us  
long-lived progeny; unite \[us\] with abundance of wealth.' Ppp. has for  
**b** *ye tvā rātrim upāsate*, and in **c** *teṣām* for *sā nas.* ⌊MGS.  
has the vs. at ii. 8.4^(d) (cf. p. 156), agreeing nearly with Ppp.⌋ The  
first half-verse is read also in TS. (v. 7. 2¹), K. (xl. 2), PGS. (iii.  
2. 2), and MB. (ii. 2. 18): TS. gives at end of **b** *upā́sate*, MB.  
*yajāmahe;* PGS. has *pratimā yā tāṁ rātrīm upāsmahe.* In our edition,  
restore a lost accent-mark over the *sṛ* of *sṛja* in **d.**
