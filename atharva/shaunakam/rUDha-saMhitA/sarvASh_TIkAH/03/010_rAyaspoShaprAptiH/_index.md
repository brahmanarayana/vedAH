### Comment
Found, except vss. 9 and 13, in Pāipp. i., but with a very different order of verses (1-4, 6, 11, 10, 8, 5, 12, 7). Used by Kāuś. in connection with the aṣṭakā ceremony, or celebration of the festival of the moon's last quarter (19. 28, and again, with more fulness, 138. 1-16), or of a particular last quarter, regarded as of special importance. The details of the Kāuś. are expanded and explained by the comm.; they are not of a nature to cast light upon the interpretation of the verses. Weber (pp. 219 ff.) discusses at considerable length the questions connected with the festival. Vāit., which does not concern itself with the aṣṭakā, yet employs vs. 6 (13. 6) at the agniṣṭoma sacrifice, in connection with the somakrayaṇī cow; and also vs. 7 c-f (9. 4) in the sākamedha rite of the cāturmāsya sacrifice. The comm. quotes vss. 2, 3, 7 as employed by Pariśiṣṭa 6. 1.
