### Translation
1. She first shone out; she became a milch-cow at Yama's; let her, rich  
in milk, yield (*duh*) to us each further summer (? *sámā*).

### Notes
The verse occurs also in several other texts: in TS. (iv. 3. 11⁵), MS.  
(ii. 13. 10), K. (xxxix. 10), PGS. (iii. 3. 5), and MB. (ii. 2. 1; 8.  
1); and its second half is RV. iv. 57. 7 **c, d**, and MB. i. 8. 8 **c,  
d**; ii. 2. 17 **c, d**, and also found below as 17. 4 **c, d**. The  
version of K. agrees (Weber) throughout with ours; TS. has, for **a**,  
*yā́ prathamā́* *vyāúchat*, with *dhukṣva* at end of **c**, and PGS.  
agrees with it; MS. has *duhe* at end of **c**; MB. (in all four  
occurrences) has *duhā utt-*, and in 8. i also *arhaṇā putra vāsa* for  
**a**. The comm. takes *sámām* in **d** as an adverbial accus. (=  
*sarveṣu vatsareṣu*), as does Weber. ⌊Cf. Hillebrandt, *Ved. Mythol.* i.  
500.⌋

The First hath dawned. With Yama may it be a cow to pour forth milk. May she be rich in milk and stream for us through many a com- ing year.
