### Translation
2. The night which the gods rejoice to meet, \[as\] a milch-cow coming  
unto \[them\], which is the spouse (*pátnī*) of the year—let her be very  
auspicious to us.

### Notes
The verse is found also in PGS. (iii. 2. 2), HGS. (ii. 17. 2) ⌊MP. (ii.  
20. 27) and MGS. (ii. 8.4^(c))⌋, and its second half in MB. (ii. 2. 16  
**c, d**); the first four have the better readings *janās* in **a** and  
*ivā ”yatīm* in **b** ⌊and MGS. has *rātrīm.*⌋ Ppp. has in **b** *dhenu  
rātrim up-*, and at the end *-galā*. For *saṁvatsarásya pátnī* (cf. vs.  
8 **a, b**) the comm. quotes TS. vii. 4. 8¹.
