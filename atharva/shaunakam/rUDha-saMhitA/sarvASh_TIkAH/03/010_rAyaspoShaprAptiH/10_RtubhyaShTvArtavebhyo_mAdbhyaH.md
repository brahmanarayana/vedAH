### Translation
10. To thee for the seasons, them of the seasons, the months, the years,  
the Creator (*dhātár*), the Disposer (*vidhātár*), the Prosperer (?  
*samṛ́dh*), the lord of existence, do I sacrifice.

### Notes
All the *saṁhitā*-mss. combine in **a** *-bhyaṣ ṭvā*, and SPP. accepts  
the reading in his text; ours emends to *-bhyas tvā;* such treatment of  
final *as* is common in Ppp., and sporadic examples of it are found  
among the AV. mss., but it is hardly to be tolerated in a text like  
ours; and the comment to Prāt. iv. 107 quotes the passage as *-bhyas  
tvā.* The comm. ⌊at xix. 37. 4⌋ deems this verse ⌊and not v. 28. 13⌋ to  
be the one repeated as xix. 37. 4; see under that verse. Ppp. has, for  
**a, b,** *yajur ṛtvigbhya ārtavebhyo mābhyas saṁvatsarāya ca*, which at  
any rate rids the text of the embarrassing *tvā*. Here the comm.  
declares the *ārtavas* to be "days and nights, etc."; *samṛ́dh* he  
explains as *samardhayitre etannāmne devāya.*
