### Translation
13. Thou whose son is Indra, whose son is Soma, daughter art thou of  
Prajāpati; fulfil thou our desires; accept our oblation.

### Notes
Wanting in Ppp., as above noted.  
  
The second *anuvāka* contains 5 hymns, 40 verses; and the quotation from  
the old Anukr. is simply *daśa*.

Indra's and Soma's mother! thou art daughter of Prajapati. Satisfy thou our hearts' desires. Gladly accept our sacrifice.
