### Translation
12. The sole *áṣṭakā*, paining herself (*tapyá-*) with penance,  
generated an embryo, a greatness, Indra; by him the gods overcame their  
foes; slayer of the barbarians became the lord of might (*śácī-*).

### Notes
The verse is found also in TS. (iv. 3. 11³), K. (xxxix. 10), PGS. (iii.  
3. 5), and MB. (ii. 3. 21); and **a** is identical with HGS. ii. 15.9  
**a** ⌊and MP. ii. 20. 35 **a**⌋: TS. accents *tápya-* in **a** (the  
comm. does the same), and its **c, d** read: *téna dásyūn vy àsahanta  
devā́ hantā́ ’surāṇām abhavac chácībhiḥ*, and K. PGS. have the same  
version; Ppp. agrees with them in reading *asurāṇām* for *dásyūnām*, and  
MB. has their **d**, but our **c**, except *asahanta* for *vy aṣah-*.  
The *ṣ* of *vy àṣ-* is distinctly required by Prāt. ii. 92; but SPP.  
gives in his text *vy às-*, against a majority of the mss. reported by  
him. Our P.M.W. are corrupt at the end, but P.M. show distinctly  
*-ībhiḥ*, indicating the reading of TS. etc. The comm. gives three  
different explanations of *gárbham* in **b**, adding *garaṇīyam* or  
*stutyam* (from *gṛ* 'sing'), and then *garbhasthavad adṛśyam* (from  
*gṛ* 'swallow'), to the true meaning. The *ekāṣṭakā* he defines to be  
"eighth day of the dark half of Māgha." The concluding pāda is *jagatī*.

Ekashtaka, burning with zealous fervour, brought forth her babe the great and glorious Indra. With him the Gods subdued their adversaries: the Lord of Might became the Dasyus' slayer.
