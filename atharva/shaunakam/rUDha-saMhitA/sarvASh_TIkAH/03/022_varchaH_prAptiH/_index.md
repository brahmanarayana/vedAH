### Comment
Found also (except vs. 6) in Pāipp. iii. Is reckoned to the varcasya gaṇa (Kāuś. 12. 10, note), and used in a charm for splendor (13. 1), with binding on an amulet of ivory. The comm. quotes the hymn also as employed by the Nakṣ. K. in a mahāśānti called brāhmī, for attainment of brahman-splendor; and by Pariś. iv. 1, in the daily morning consecration of an elephant for a king.
