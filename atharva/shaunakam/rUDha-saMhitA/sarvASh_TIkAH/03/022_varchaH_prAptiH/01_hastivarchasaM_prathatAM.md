### Translation
1. Let elephant-splendor, great glory, spread itself, which came into  
being from Aditi's body; that same have all together given to me—all the  
gods, Aditi, in unison.

### Notes
⌊Cf. vii. 17. 3 n.⌋  
  
A number of the mss. (including our Bp.Op.) read *ā́dityās* ⌊accent!⌋ in  
**b**, and several of ours follow it with *yám* instead of *yát*. Ppp.  
rectifies the meter of **d** by reading *devāsas*. Emendation in **a**  
to *bṛhádyaśas* would be acceptable. śB. (iii. 1. 3. 4; perhaps on the  
basis of **b**?) has a legend of the production of the elephant from  
something born of Aditi (see R. in *Ind. Stud.* xiv. 392). The comm.  
explains *prathatām* in **a** by *asmāsu prathitam prakhyātam bhavatu*  
'be proclaimed as belonging to us.' In our edition, an accent-mark has  
dropped out from under the *ba* of *-babhūva*. An irregular verse,  
scanned by the Anukr. as 12 + 10: 10 + 10 = 42, but convertible into 45  
syllables by resolving *tanú-as, sáru-e, víśu-e* (of which only the  
first is unobjectionable). ⌊If we read *devāsas* in **d**, the vs. is in  
order (12 + 11:? + 11), except in **c** (*tád ít sárve?*).⌋

Famed be the Elephant's strength, the lofty glory, which out of Aditi's body took existence! They all have given me this for my possession, even all the Gods and Aditi accordant.
