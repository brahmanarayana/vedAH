### Translation
2. Let both Mitra and Varuṇa, Indra and Rudra, \[each\] take notice; the  
all-nourishing gods—let them anoint me with splendor.

### Notes
All the mss.\* read *cetatus* at end of **b**, and so does Ppp., and our  
edition has it; but SPP. follows the comm. and substitutes *cetatu;* SV.  
i. 154 has *sómaḥ pūṣā́ ca cetatuḥ;* the translation implies *cetatu*,  
the other being probably a false form, generated under stress of the  
difficult construction of a singular verb with the preceding subjects.  
Weber takes it as *cetatus*, 3d dual perf. of root *cat* "frighten into  
submission." The Anukr. takes no notice of the deficiency of a syllable  
in **a**. \*⌊So W's two drafts; but his collations note P.M.W. as  
reading *cetutaḥ* (!) and Op. as reading *cetatú*.⌋

On this have Mitra, Varuna, Indra, and Rudra fixed their thought. May those all-fostering deities anoint and balm me with his strength.
