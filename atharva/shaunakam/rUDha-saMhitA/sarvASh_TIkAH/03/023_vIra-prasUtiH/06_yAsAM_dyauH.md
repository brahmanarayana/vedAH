### Translation
6. The plants of which heaven has been the father, earth the mother,  
ocean the root—let those herbs of the gods (*dāíva*) favor thee, in  
order to acquisition of a son.

### Notes
The first half-verse is found again later, as viii. 7. 2 **c, d**; in  
both places, part of the mss. read *dyāúṣ p-* (here only our O., with  
half of SPP's); and that appears to be required by Prāt. ii. 74,  
although the looser relation of the two words favors in a case like this  
the reading *dyāúḥ*, which both editions present. Ppp- has an  
independent version: *yāsāṁ pitā parjanyo bhūmir mātā babhūva:* with  
*devīs* in **c** (this the comm. also reads) and *oṣadhīs* in **d**. The  
verse is irregular, and capable of being variously read; and what the  
Anukr. means by its definition is obscure.
