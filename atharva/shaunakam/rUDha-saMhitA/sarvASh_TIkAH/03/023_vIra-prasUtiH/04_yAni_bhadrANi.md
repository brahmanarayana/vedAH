### Translation
4. And what excellent seeds the bulls generate, with them do thou  
acquire (*vid*) a son; become thou a productive milch-cow.

### Notes
śGS. (as above) has for **b** *puruṣā janayanti naḥ;* it rectifies the  
meter of **c** by reading *tebhiṣ ṭ-* for *tāts t-* (and it has *janaya*  
for *vindasva*); in **d**, it gives *suprasūs*, which is better than our  
*sā́ pr-*. MP. (as above) ⌊i. 13. 3⌋ repeats our verse very closely, only  
with *nas* for *ca* in **b**, and *putrān* in **c**; and it has, just  
before, the line *tāni bhadrṇi bījāny ṛṣabhā janayantu nāu*. A verse in  
HGS. (as above) is quite similar: *yāni prabhūṇi vīryāṇy ṛṣabhā  
janayantu naḥ: tāis tvaṁ garbhiṇī bhava sa jāyatāṁ vīratamaḥ svānām;*  
and it offers a little later *sā prasūr dhenugā bhava*. Our reading  
*tāis tvám* in **c** is assured by Prāt. ii. 84; the resolution *tu-ám*  
makes the meter correct.
