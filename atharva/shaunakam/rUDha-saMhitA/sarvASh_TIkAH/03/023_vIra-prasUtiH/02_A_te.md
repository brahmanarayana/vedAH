### Translation
2. Unto thy womb let a fœtus come, a male one, as an arrow to a quiver;  
let a hero be born unto thee here, a ten-months' son.

### Notes
This verse and the two following occur in śGS. (i. 19. 6), and this one  
without variant. Also this one in MP. ⌊i. 12. 9⌋ (Winternitz, p. 94),  
and in an appendix to AGS. i. 13. 6 (Stenzler, p. 48), with *yonim*  
after *garbhas* in **a** (and AGS. reads *āitu*), and omitting *atra* in  
**c**; and further in HGS. (i. 25. 1), like MP. in **a**, but retaining  
*atra*.

As arrow to the quiver, so let a male embryo enter thee. Then from thy side be born a babe, a ten-month child, thy hero son.
