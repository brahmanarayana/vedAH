### Translation
1. Just here I fix (*ni-mi*) \[my\] dwelling (*śā́lā*) firm; may it stand  
in security, sprinkling ghee; unto thee here, O dwelling, may we resort  
(*sam-car*) with all our heroes, with good heroes, with unharmed heroes.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *abhi* instead of *upa* in **d**. Pādas **a, b** are found in  
PGS. iii. 4. 4, with *tiṣṭhatu* for *-āti;* and **b** in śGS. iii. 3,  
with *tiṣṭha* for the same; HGS. (i. 27. 2) has the whole verse, with  
*tiṣṭhati* in **a**, *anu* (for *upa*) in **d**, and *suvīrās* before  
*sarvav-* in **c**.
