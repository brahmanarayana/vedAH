### Translation
2. Just here stand thou firm, O dwelling, rich in horses, in kine, in  
pleasantness, in refreshment, in ghee, in milk; erect thyself (*ut-śri*)  
in order to great good-fortune.

### Notes
Ppp. leaves the *a* of *aśvāvatī* in **b** unelided. PGS. (ibid.) has  
pādas **b** and **d**, making one verse of them with 3 **c, d**; pādas  
**a, b** are also found in śGS. (ibid.), with considerable variants:  
*sthūṇe* for *dhruvā*, *dhruvā* for *śāle*, and *sīlamāvatī* for  
*sūnṛ-;* and HGS. (ibid.) has again the whole verse, with *ūrjasvatī  
payasā pinvamānā* for **c**. The comm., with the usual queer perversion  
of the sense of *sūnṛtā*, renders *sūnṛtāvatī* by *bahubhiḥ  
priyasatvavāgbhir bālādīnāṁ vāṇībhir yuktā.* Pādas **b** and **c** are  
*jagatī.*
