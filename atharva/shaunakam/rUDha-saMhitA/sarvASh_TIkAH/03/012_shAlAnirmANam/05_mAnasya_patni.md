### Translation
5. O mistress of the building (? *mā́na*), as sheltering, pleasant, hast  
thou, a goddess, been fixed by the gods in the beginning; clothing  
thyself in grass, mayest thou be well-willing; then mayest thou give us  
wealth together with heroes.

### Notes
Ppp. has, for **c, d**, *ūnnaṁ vasanā sumanā yaśas tvaṁ rayiṁ no dhi  
subhage suvīram.* "Grass" in **c** refers probably to a thatched roof.  
*Mā́na* the comm. gives two explanations for: either "of the reverend  
(*mānanīya*) lord of the site (*vāstupati*)," or else "of the spoiling  
(? *mīyamāna*) grain etc." (*patnī* in this case signiying *pālayitri*).  
In **b** the comm. reads *nirmitā.* HGS. (i. 27. 8) has **a, b, c**  
(with a wholly different **d**) in a corrupt form: *mā naḥ sapatnaḥ  
śaraṇaḥ syonā devo devebhir vimitā ’sy agre: tṛṇaṁ vasānāḥ sumanā asi  
tvam;* but our **d** (with *-vīrāṁ r-*) occurred just before (i. 27. 7).
