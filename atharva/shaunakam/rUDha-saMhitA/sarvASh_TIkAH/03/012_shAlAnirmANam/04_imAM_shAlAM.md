### Translation
4. This dwelling let Savitar, Vayu, Indra, Brihaspati fix, foreknowing;  
let the Maruts sprinkle it with water, with ghee; let king Bhaga deepen  
(*ni-tan*) our ploughing.

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **a, b** *vāyur agnis tvaṣṭā hotā ni*, and has *somas*  
(which suits *rājā* better) for *bhagas* in **d**. In **c** it begins  
with the true reading *ukṣantu;* this is so naturally suggested as  
emendation of the *uchántu* of the mss. that all the translators assume  
it (Weber, strangely mistaking the plain statement of the *Index  
Verborum*, accuses us of having wrongly altered *ukṣántu* in our edition  
to *uchántu!*); *ukṣántu* is also read by the comm., and by two or three  
of SPP's mss. that follow him; and SPP. very properly admits it into his  
text. SPP. also reads after it *udnā́*, with the comm., but against all  
his mss. ⌊except the *śrotriya* K⌋; there is no instance where *udnā́*  
and *udnás* are correctly read in any of them (here, our Bp.O.Op. have  
*utnā́*, P.M. *utvā́*, the rest\* *unnā́:* our edition gives *unnā́*, and  
Weber has failed to see that it was corrected in the *Index Verborum*  
⌊under *udán*⌋). The comm. makes **d** refer to the ploughing of the  
site of the house: *śālābhūmeḥ karṣaṇaṁ nitarāṁ karotu.* ⌊\*E.H.D.K.Kp.  
and Ppp. have *unnā́;* I. has *uttā́;* W. has *-tu tvā*.⌋  
  
⌊For *uchantu*, see x. 9. 23 n.⌋

This House may Savitar and Vayu stablish, Brihaspati who knows the way, and Indra. May the moist Maruts sprinkle it with fatness, and may King Bhaga make our corn-land fruitful.
