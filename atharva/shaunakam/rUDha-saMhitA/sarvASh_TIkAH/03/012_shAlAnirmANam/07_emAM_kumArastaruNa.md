### Translation
7. To it the tender boy, to it the calf, with moving creatures  
(*jágat*), to it the jar of *parisrút*, with mugs of curd, have come.

### Notes
Ppp. has *tvā* for *imām* in **a** and **c**, and in **c** *pariśṛtaṣ;*  
and it ends **d** with *kalaśaś ca yā.* The mss. vary between  
*parisrútas* and *-śrút-* (our Bp.H.O.Op.Kp. have *ś*); the comm. has  
*s*, and renders the word by *parisravaṇaśīlasya madhunaḥ* 'foaming over  
sweet.' The word is quoted in the comment to Prāt. ii. 106 as an example  
of *s* after *i* protected from lingualization by a following *r*. The  
comm. reads in **c** *kumbhās*, and  in **d** *kalaśīs;* half the mss.  
(including our Bp.E.I.H.K.) accent *kalaśāís.* The comm. explains  
*jágatā* as *gamanaśīlena gavādinā*, which is doubtless its true sense.  
The verse is found also in AGS. (ii. 8. 16), PGS. (iii. 4. 4), śGS.  
(iii. 2. 9), and HGS. (i. 27. 4): the first two and the last have (like  
Ppp.) *tvā*, and śGS. reads *enam* (for *é ’mā́m*); for *jágatā*, PGS.  
has *jagadāis* and AGS. *jāyatām;* śGS. gives *bhuvanas*, with *pari*  
for *sahá;* all differ again as to the last word, presenting *-upa*  
(PGS.), *ayan* (AGS.), *ayann iva* (HGS.) or *gaman* (śGS.); and śGS.  
has further *kumbhyās* in **c**, while for *parisrútas* AGS. has  
*pariśritas* and HGS. *hiraṇmayas* ⌊see also MP. ii. 15. 4 and MGS. ii.  
11. 12^(b)⌋. The epithet *ārṣī*, added by the Anukr. to the metrical  
definition of the verse, is without meaning as distinguishing it from  
vs. 9 ⌊cf. iii. 14. 6, note⌋.
