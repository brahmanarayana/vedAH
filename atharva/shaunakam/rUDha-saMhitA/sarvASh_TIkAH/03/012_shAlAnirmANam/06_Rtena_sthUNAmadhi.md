### Translation
6. With due order, O beam (*vaṅśá*), ascend the post; formidable,  
bearing rule, force away (*apa-vṛj*) the foes; let not the attendants  
(*upasattár*) of thy houses be harmed, O dwelling; may we live a hundred  
autumns with all our heroes.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *sthuṇā ’dhi* in **a**, and in **c, d** has *-tāro ‘tra  
virājāṁ jīvāṁ śaradaś śatāni.* Both meter and sense indicate that  
*gṛhā́ṇām* is an intrusion in **c**; and *suvī́rās* at the end would  
rectify the meter of **d**. The first pāda is the beginning of a verse  
in AGS. ii. 9; and HGS. (i. 27. 7) has the first half-verse, with  
*sthūṇāu* in **a**, and *ūrdhvas* and *apa sedha* in **b** ⌊cf. MP. ii.  
15. 6; MGS. ii. 11. 14 is corrupt⌋. The comm. reads *arṣan* for *riṣan*  
in **c**; he explains *ṛténa* by *abādhyena rūpeṇa saha*, and  
*upasattāras* by *upasadanakartāras*. The verse (11 + 11: 14 + 12 = 48)  
is defined by the Anukr. with mechanical correctness.
