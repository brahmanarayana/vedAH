### Translation
1. The gods have turned away from old age; thou, O Agni; away from the  
niggard; I away from all evil \[have turned\], away from *yákṣma*, to  
union (*sám*) with life-time.

### Notes
The *acṛtan* of our text is an error for *avṛtan*, which all the mss.  
(and, of course, SPP.) read; *vi-vṛt* is common in the sense 'part  
from.' The comm. gives instead *avṛtam*, which he takes as 2d dual,  
rendering it by *viyojayatam*, and understanding *devā́* (p. *devā́ḥ*) as  
*devāu*, vocative, namely the two Aśvins! and he supplies a *yojayāmi*  
also in the second half-verse, with an *imam* ⌊referring to the Vedic  
scholar⌋ for it to govern.

May Gods release from failing strength, thou Agni, from malignity! I free from every evil, from decline: I compass round with life.
