### Translation
5. Tvashṭar harnesses (*yuj*) for his daughter a wedding-car (*vahatú*);  
at the news, all this creation (*bhúvana*) goes away; I away from etc.  
etc.

### Notes
⌊Discussed at length by Bloomfield, JAOS. xv. 181 ff.⌋ An odd alteration  
of RV. X. 17. 1 **a, b** (our xviii. i. 53, which see), which reads  
*kṛṇoti* for *yunakti*, and *sám eti* for *ví yāti;* and it is very  
oddly thrust in here, where it seems wholly out of place; *ví yāti* must  
be rendered as above (differently from its RV. value), to make any  
connection with the refrain and with the preceding verses. Weber's  
suggestion that it is Tvashṭar's intent to marry his own daughter that  
makes such a stir is refuted by the circumstance that the verb used is  
active. According to the comm., *vahatú* is the wedding outfit (*duhitrā  
saha prityā prasthāpanīyaṁ vastrālaṁkārādi dravyam*), and *yunakti* is  
simply *prasthāpayati*. The *pada*-mss., in accordance with the later  
use of *íti*, reckon it here to pāda **a**.
