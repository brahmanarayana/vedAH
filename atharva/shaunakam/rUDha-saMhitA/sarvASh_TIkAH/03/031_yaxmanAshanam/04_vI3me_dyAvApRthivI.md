### Translation
4. Apart \[from one another\] go heaven-and-earth here (*imé*), away the  
roads, to one and another quarter; I away from etc. etc.

### Notes
*Itás* in **a** is here understood as 3d dual of *i*, with Weber and  
with the comm. (= *vigacchatas*), since the meaning is thus decidedly  
more acceptable; its accent is easily enough explained as that of the  
verb in the former of two successive clauses involving it (though  
*avṛtan* was not accented in vs. 1 **a**). The redundancy in **a** is  
easily corrected by contracting to *-pṛthvī;* the Anukr., however, does  
not sanction this.
