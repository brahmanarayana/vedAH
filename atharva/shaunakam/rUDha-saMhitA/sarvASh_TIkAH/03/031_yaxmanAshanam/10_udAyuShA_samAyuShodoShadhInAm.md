### Translation
10. Up with life-time; together with life-time; up with the sap of the  
herbs: I away from etc. etc.

### Notes
The first half-verse, with the first half of our vs. 11, makes a verse  
occurring in several texts: TS. (i. 2. 8¹), TA. (iv. 42, vs. 31: agrees  
precisely with TS.), VS. (Kāṇv. ii. VII. 5), AśS. (i. 3. 23), PGS. (iii.  
2. 14). All these read *svāyúṣā* instead of *sám ā́ytiṣā* in **a**; and  
VS. and PGS. lack the second pāda. The comm. points out that *asthāma*  
is to be understood from vs. 11.

Rise up with life, conjoined with life. Up, with the sap of growing plants! I free, etc.
