### Translation
3. The animals (*paśú*) of the village \[have turned\] away from those  
of the forest; the waters have gone (*sṛ*) away from thirst; I away  
from etc. etc.

### Notes
All the mss. leave *āpas* in **b** unaccented, as if vocative; our text  
makes the necessary correction to *ā́pas*, and so does SPP. in his  
*pada*-text, while in *saṁhitā* he strangely (perhaps by an oversight?)  
retains *āpas*. The comm. paraphrases *ví...asaran* with *vigatā  
bhavanti*, not venturing to turn it into a causative as he did *vy  
avṛtan*. The Anukr. takes no notice of the redundant syllable in **a**.
