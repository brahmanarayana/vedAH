### Translation
3. Since he has not named (*grah*) thy name, thou also stayest (*ram*)  
not with him as husband; unto distant distance make we my rival go.

### Notes
This translation of the first half-verse follows closely our text. RV.  
has a very different version: *nahy àsyā nā́ma gṛbhṇā́mi nó asmín ramate  
jáne* 'since I name not her (its?) name, she (it?) also does not stay  
with (find pleasure in) this person (people?).' Winternitz applauds and  
accepts his commentator's explanation of **b**: "nor finds she pleasure  
in me" (taking *ayaṁ janas* in the much later sense of "I"), but it  
seems wholly unsatisfactory. The meter calls for emendation in **a** to  
*jagráha* 'I have named,' equivalent to the RV. reading; and R. makes  
the emendation, and retains the *jáne* of RV., rendering (as addressed  
by the woman using the charm to the plant) "I have not named \[to her\]  
thy name; and thou stayest (stayedst) not with the person (bei der  
Person)." The comm. regards the rival as addressed, and conveniently  
makes *ramase* = *ramasva:* "stay thou not with this my husband." Weber  
renders *ramase* by "kosest," thou dalliest not. No satisfactory  
solution of the difficulty is yet found.

Indeed he hath not named her name: thou with this husband dalliest not, Far into distance most remote we drive the rival wife away.
