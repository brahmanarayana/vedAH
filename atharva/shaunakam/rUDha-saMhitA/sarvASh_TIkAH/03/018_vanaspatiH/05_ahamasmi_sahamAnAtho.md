### Translation
5. I am overpowering; likewise art thou very powerful; we both, becoming  
full of power, will overpower my rival.

### Notes
The verse xix. 32. 5 is a variation on this. RV. reads *átha* for *átho*  
in **b**, and the older *bhūtvī́* for *bhūtvā́* in **c**.

I am the conqueror, and thou, thou also art victorious: As victory attends us both we will subdue my fellowwife.
