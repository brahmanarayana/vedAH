### Translation
2. O thou of outstretched leaves, fortunate, god-quickened, powerful, do  
thou thrust away my rival, make my husband wholly mine.

### Notes
'Outstretched,' lit. supine; horizontal, with the face of the leaf  
upward. RV. has *dhama* for *nuda* in **c**, and the modern *kuru* for  
*kṛdhi* at the end. Ppp. offers only the first half-verse, in this form:  
*uttānaparṇāṁ subhagāṁ sahamānāṁ sahasvatīm;* MP. also has *sahamāne*  
instead of *devajūte*.
