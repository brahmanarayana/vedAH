### Translation
6. Ye gods that are in this upward quarter, helpful (*ávasvant*) by  
name—of you there the arrows are Brihaspati: do ye be etc. etc.

### Notes
In this quarter (*upári*) according to TS., the name is "overlords," and  
the arrows "rain, the helpful one." Ppp. adds at the end *iti  
rakṣāmantram*, and our verse viii. 3. 1 follows. TS. adds an  
imprecation, nearly like that in our hymn 27: *tébhyo vo námas té no  
mṛḍayata té yáṁ dviṣmó yáś ca no dvéṣṭi táṁ vo jámbhe dadhāmi*.
