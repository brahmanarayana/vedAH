### Translation
5. Since I shall bind thee \[on\] for spoiling, I shall spoil the  
*kābavá;* ye shall go up with curses, like swift chariots.

### Notes
The translation implies emendation of *bhartsyā́mi* (our edition) or  
*bhatsyā́mi* (SPP's and the comm.) to *bhantsyā́mi*, from root *bandh*,  
which seems plainly indicated as called for; the comm. explains *bhats-*  
first as *badhnāmi*, and then as *dīpayāmi;* the great majority of mss.  
give *bharts-*. Ppp. is quite corrupt here: *juṣṭī tvā kāṁcchā ’bhi  
joṣayitvā bhavaṁ.* The comm. has at the end *cariṣyatha* (two or three  
of SPP's mss. agreeing with him), and he combines in **c** *udāśavas*  
into one word, "harnessed with speedy horses that have their mouths  
raised for going."

Yea, I will chide thee to thy shame, I will disgrace the Kabava. Under our impracations ye, like rapid cars, shall pass away.
