### Translation
6. A hundred and one *víṣkandhas* \[are\] distributed over the earth;  
thee have they first taken up, of them the *víṣkandha-*spoiling amulet.

### Notes
That is, 'an amulet that spoils those *víṣkandhas*' (Weber otherwise).  
In **c**, for the *jaharus* of all the mss. and of both editions, we  
ought of course to have *jahrus;* this the comm. reads: such expansions  
of *r* with preceding or following consonant to a syllable are not rare  
in the manuscripts. Ppp. has a different second half-verse: *teṣāṁ ca  
sarveṣām idam asti viṣkandhadūṣaṇam.* The second pāda is found, in a  
different connection, as MB. ii. 8. 4 **b**. The comment on Prāt. ii.  
104, in quoting this verse, appears to derive *víṣkandha* from root  
*skand*. The verse is made *bhurij* only by the false form *jaharus*.  
⌊For "101," see note to iii. 11. 5.⌋
