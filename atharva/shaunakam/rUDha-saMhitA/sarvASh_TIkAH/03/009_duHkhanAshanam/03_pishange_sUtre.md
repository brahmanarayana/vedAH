### Translation
3. On a reddish string a *khṛ́gala*—that the pious (*vedhás*) bind on;  
let the binders (?) make impotent the flowing (?), puffing (?) *kābavá*.

### Notes
All obscure and questionable. Ppp's version is: for **a**, *sūtre  
piśun̄khe khugilaṁ;* in **b**, *yad* for *tad;* for **c**, *śravasyaṁ  
śuṣma kābabam* (the nāgarī copyist writes *kāvardham*). The comm. also  
has in **c** *śravasyam*, and three or four of SPP's mss. follow him;  
the translation assumes it to be for *srav-*. The comm. explains  
*khṛ́galam* by *tanutrāṇam* 'armor,' quoting RV. ii. 39. 4 as authority;  
*śravasyam* by *bālarūpam annam arhati* (since *śravas* is an  
*annanāman!*); *śúṣmam* by *śoṣakam* ⌊see Bloomfield, ZDMG. xlviii.  
574⌋; *kābava* as a hindrance related with a *kabu*, which is a speckled  
(*karburavarṇa*) cruel animal; and *bandhúras* is either the amulet  
bound upon us, or it is for *-rās*, "the amulet, staff, etc., held by  
us."

Then to a tawny-coloured string the wise and skilful bind a brush. Let bandages make impotent the strong and active Kabava.
