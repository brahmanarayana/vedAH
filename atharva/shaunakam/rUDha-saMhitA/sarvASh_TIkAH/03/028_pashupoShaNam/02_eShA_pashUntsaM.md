### Translation
2. She quite destroys the cattle, becoming a flesh-eater, devourer (?  
*vy-ádvarī*); also one should give her to a priest (*brahmán*); so would  
she be pleasant, propitious.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The *pada*-text divides *vi॰ádvarī*, evidently taking the word from root  
*ad* 'eat'; the Pet. Lex. suggests emendation to *vyádhvarī*, from  
*vyadh* 'pierce.' The comm. reads *vyadhvarī*, but he defines it first  
as coming from *adhvan*, and meaning "possessed of bad roads, that cause  
unhappiness," or, second, as from *adhvara*, and signifying "having  
magical sacrifices, that give obstructed fruit"! ⌊See note to vi. 50. 3,  
where W. corrects the text to *vyadvará:* accent of masc. and fem.,  
*Gram.* § 1171 a, b.⌋
