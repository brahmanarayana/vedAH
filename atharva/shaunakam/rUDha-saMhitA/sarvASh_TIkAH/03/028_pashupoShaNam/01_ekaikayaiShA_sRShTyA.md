### Translation
1. She herself came into being by a one-by-one creation, where the  
being-makers created the kine of all forms; where the twinning \[cow\]  
gives birth, out of season, she destroys the cattle, snarling, angry.

### Notes
The translation implies emendation of *rúśatī* at the end to *rúṣyatī*  
or *ruṣatī́* ⌊rather *rúṣyatī*, so as to give a *jagatī* cadence⌋—which,  
considering the not infrequent confusion of the sibilants, especially  
the palatal and lingual, in our text and its mss., and the loss of *y*  
after a sibilant, is naturally suggested ⌊cf. iv. 16. 6^(b)⌋. The comm.  
makes a yet easier thing of taking *rúśatī* from a root *ruś* 'injure,'  
but we have no such root. Some of our mss. (P.M.W.E.) read *eṣā́m* in  
**a**, and two (P.O.) have *sṛ́ṣṭvā*.\* The comm. understands *sṛṣṭis*  
with *eṣā* in **a**, and explains *ekāikayā* by *ekāikavyaktyā*. Perhaps  
we should emend to *ékāí ’kayā* 'one \[creature\] by one \[act of\]  
creation' ⌊and reject *eṣā́*?, as the meter demands⌋. See Weber's notes  
for the comparison of popular views as to the birth of twins, more  
generally regarded as of good omen. The Anukr. apparently counts 11  
⌊13?⌋ + 15: 12 + 12 = 50 ⌊52?⌋ syllables; either *bhūtakṛ́tas* or  
*viśvárupās* could well enough be spared out of **b** ⌊better the  
former; but it is bad meter at best⌋. \*⌊Shown by accent to be a blunder  
for *sṛ́ṣṭyā*, not *sṛṣṭvā*.⌋
