### Translation
4. Here prosperity, here sap—here be thou best winner of a thousand;  
make the cattle prosper, O twinning one.

### Notes
The comm. supplies *bhavatu* to the first pāda. All the mss. agree in  
giving the false accent *sahásrasātamā* in **b**; it should be  
*sahasrasā́tamā*—or, to rectify the meter, simply *-sā́*. It  
*pada*-division, *sahásra॰sātama* is prescribed by the text of Prāt. iv.  
45. *Kakubh* properly has no need of the adjunct *yavamadhyā;* it is  
very seldom used by our Anukr. as name of a whole verse ⌊8 + 12: 8⌋.
