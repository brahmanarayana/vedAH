### Translation
5. Where the good-hearted \[and\] well-doing revel, quitting disease of  
their own body—into that world hath the twinning one come into being;  
let her not injure our men and cattle.

### Notes
The first half-verse is also that of vi. 120. 3 (which occurs further in  
TA.). Some of SPP's mss. write in **b** *tanvā̀s*, protracting the  
*kampa*-syllable.
