### Translation
6. The dawns submit themselves (? *sam-nam*) to the sacrifice  
(*adhvará*), as Dadhikrāvan to the bright place; hitherward let them  
convey for me Bhaga, acquirer of good things, as vigorous (*vājín*)  
horses a chariot.

### Notes
All the other texts, including Ppp., read *nas* instead of *me* at end  
of **c**. The comm. renders *sáṁ namanta* by *saṁ gacchantām*, calls  
*dadhikrāvan* a horse's name, and explains the action of the obscure  
pāda **b** by *sa yathā śuddhāya gamanāya saṁnaddho bhavati.* The Anukr.  
appears to sanction the abbreviation *rátham ’va* in **d**.

To this our sacrifice may the Dawns incline them, and come to the pure place like Dadhikravan. As strong steeds draw a chariot may they bring me hitherward Bhaga who discovers treasure.
