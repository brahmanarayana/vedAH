### Translation
3. O Bhaga, conductor, Bhaga, thou of true bestowal, Bhaga, help upward  
this prayer (*dhī́*), giving to us; O Bhaga, cause us to multiply with  
kine, with horses, O Bhaga, with men,—rich in men may we be.

### Notes
In this verse AV. and RV. agree throughout; TB. reads *ava* with  
unlengthened final in **b**, and VS. no with unlingualized nasal in  
**c**.

Bhaga, our guide, Bhaga whose gifts are faithful, favour this hymn and give us wealth, O Bhaga. Bhaga, augment our store of kine and horses. Bhaga, may we be rich in men and heroes.
