### Translation
7. Let excellent dawns, rich in horses, rich in kine, rich in heroes,  
always shine for us, yielding (*duh*) ghee, on all sides drunk of: do ye  
protect us ever with well-beings.

### Notes
TB. read *prápīnās* at end of **c**; Ppp. has instead *pravīṇās;* the  
comm. explains by *āpyāyitās* 'filled up, made teeming,' which is very  
possibly to be preferred. ⌊Delete the accent-mark under *gómatīr.*⌋

May the kind Mornings dawn on us for ever with, wealth of kine, of horses, and of heroes. Streaming with all abundance, pouring fatness, Do ye preserve us evermore with blessings!
