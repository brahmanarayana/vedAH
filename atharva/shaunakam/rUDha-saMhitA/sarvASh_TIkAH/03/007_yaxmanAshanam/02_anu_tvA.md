### Translation
2. After thee hath the bull-gazelle stridden with his four feet; O  
horn, do thou unfasten (*vi-sā*) the *kṣetriyá* that is compacted (?) in  
his heart.

### Notes
Ppp. has a different **d**: *yadi kiṁcit kṣetriyaṁ hṛdi.* The word-play  
in **c**, between *viṣāṇā* and *vi-sā*, is obvious; that any was  
intended with *viṣūcīna* in 1 **d** is very questionable. This verse,  
again, is found in ĀpśS. ib., but with considerable variants: *anu*  
*tvā hariṇo mṛgaḥ paḍbhiś caturbhir akramīt: viṣāṇe vi ṣyāi ’taṁ  
granthiṁ yad asya gulphitaṁ hṛdi;* here it is a "knot" that is to be  
untied by means of the horn. One of our mss. (O.) has in **c**  
*paḍbhís*, like ĀpśS. The comm., followed by a couple of SPP's mss.,  
further agrees with ĀpśS. by reading *gulphitam* in **c**, and explains  
it as *gulphavad grathitam.* The occurrence of the rare and obscure  
*guṣpita* ⌊misprinted *guṣṭitam*⌋ in śB. iii. 2. 2. 20 is also in  
connection with the use of a deer's horn.

With his four feet the vigorous Buck hath bounded in pursuit of thee. Unbind the chronic sickness, Horn! deeply inwoven in the heart.
