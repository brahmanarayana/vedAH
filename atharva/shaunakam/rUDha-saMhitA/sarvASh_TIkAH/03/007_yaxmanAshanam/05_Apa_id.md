### Translation
5. The waters verily \[are\] remedial, the waters disease-expelling, the  
waters remedial of everything; let them release thee from *kṣetriyá*.

### Notes
The first three pādas are RV. x. 137. 6 **a, b, c**, save that RV. has  
*sárvasya* in **c**; but vi. 91. 3 below represents the same verse yet  
more closely.

Water, indeed, hath power to heal, Water drives malady away. May water--for it healeth all--free thee from permanent disease.
