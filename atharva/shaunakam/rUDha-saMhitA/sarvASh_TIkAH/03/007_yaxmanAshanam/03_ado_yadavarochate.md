### Translation
3. What shines down yonder, like a four-sided roof (*chadís*), therewith  
we make all the *kṣetriyá* disappear from thy limbs.

### Notes
In our edition, *téna* in **c** should be *ténā*, as read by nearly all  
the *saṁhitā*-mss. (all save our P.M.), and by SPP. The sense of **a,  
b** is obscure to the comm., as to us; he guesses first that it is "the  
deer-shaped thing extended in the moon's disk," or else "a deer's skin  
stretched on the ground"; *chadís* is "the mat of grass with which a  
house is covered." Weber takes it as a constellation; Grill  
(mistranslating *pakṣa* by "post"), as the gazelle himself set up on his  
four legs, with his horns for roof! If a constellation, it might be the  
Arab "manzil" γ, ζ, η, π Aquarii, which its shape and name connect with  
a tent: see *Sūrya-Siddhānta*, note to viii. 9 (under 25th asterism);  
this is not very far from the stars mentioned in the next verse ⌊λ and ν  
Scorpionis⌋.
