### Translation
2. I know him that is rich in milk; he hath made the grain much; the god  
that is "collector" by name, him do we call, whichever is in the house  
of one who sacrifices not.

### Notes
That is, away from the service of the impious to that of us, the pious.  
A god "collector" (*sambhṛ́tvan*) is not known elsewhere. Ppp. reads for  
**a** *ahaṁ veda yathā payaś*, and, in **c-e**, *yo vedas tavaṁ yajāmahe  
sarvasyā yaś ca no gṛhe*. In our edition, an accent-mark has slipped  
from under *-dā-* to under *ve-* at the beginning. It is the fourth pāda  
that is *nicṛt* ⌊read *táṁ-taṁ?⌋.*

Him who is rich in milk I know. Abundant hath he made our corn. The God whose name is Gatherer, him we invoke who dwelleth in his house who sacrifices not.
