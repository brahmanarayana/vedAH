### Translation
6. Three measures of the Gandharvas, four of the house-mistress; of them  
whichever is richest in fatness, with that one we touch thee.

### Notes
Ppp. reads at the end *marṣāmasi;* the comm. regards the grain as the  
object of address in **d**, and the intent to be "increase thou by the  
act of touching"; Weber understands rather the master of the house, or  
perhaps the harvest-wagon. The "measures" are doubtless those of grain  
set apart; the comm. calls them *samṛddhihetavaḥ kalāḥ;* and he gives as  
alternative explanation of "house-mistress" the Apsarases, spouses of  
the Gandharvas!

Three sheaves are the Gandharvas' claim, the lady of the house hath four. We touch thee with the sheaf that is the most abundant of them all.
