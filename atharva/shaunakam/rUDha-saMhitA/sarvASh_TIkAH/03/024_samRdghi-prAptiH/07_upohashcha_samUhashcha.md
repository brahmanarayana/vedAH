### Translation
7. Bringer (*upohá*) and gatherer (*samūhá*) \[are\] thy (two)  
distributors, O Prajāpati; let them convey hither fatness, much  
unexhausted plenty.

### Notes
Two or three of our mss. (P.s.m.M.W.) read in **c** *vahatam*, as does  
the comm., with one of SPP's mss. The comm. explains *kṣattā́rāu* by  
*sārathī abhimatakāryasampādakāu*.
