### Translation
1. Rich in milk \[are\] the herbs, rich in milk my utterance (*vácas*);  
accordingly, of them that are rich in milk I bring by thousands.

### Notes
The first half-verse occurs again, a little changed, as xviii. 3. 56  
**a, b**; it is also RV. X. 17. 14 **a, b**, etc.: see under xviii. 3.  
56. The comm. reads in **d** *bhareyam* for *bhare ’ham;* he understands  
"be" instead of "are" in **a, b**. For second half-verse Ppp. has *atho  
payasvatāṁ paya ā harāmi sahasraśaḥ*.
