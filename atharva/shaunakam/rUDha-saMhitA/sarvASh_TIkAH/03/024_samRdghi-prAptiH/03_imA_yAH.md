### Translation
3. These five directions that there are, the five races (*kṛṣṭí*)  
descended from Manu (*mānavī́*)—may they bring fatness (*sphātí*)  
together here, as streams \[bring\] drift when it has rained.

### Notes
Or *nadī́s* might be nom. sing.; the comm. of course takes it as plural;  
*śāpam* he understands as "a kind of animals" (*prāṇijātam*). Our O.Op.  
have at the end *-vahāṁ*. Ppp. reads for **b** *mānavāiḥ pañca gṛṣṭayaḥ*  
(cf. *gṛṣṭi* for *kṛṣṭi* in ii. 13. 3); and, for **c, d**, *sarvāś  
śaṁbhūr mayobhuvo vṛṣe śāpaṁ nadīr iva*.
