### Translation
5. O hundred-handed one, bring together; O thousand-handed one, pile  
together; of what is made and of what is to be made do thou convey  
together the fatness here.

### Notes
Ppp. has for **b** *sahasrāi ’va saṁgiraḥ*, for **c** *yathe ’ya sphātir  
āyasi*, and for **d** our **c**.  The comm. reads *samāvaham* at the  
end, rendering it *samprāpto ’smi;* to the adjectives in **c** he  
supplies *dhanadhānyādeḥ*. ⌊*Sáṁ kira*, 'overwhelm,' i.e. 'bestow  
abundantly.'⌋
