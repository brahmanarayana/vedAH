### Translation
5. Do thou, O Agni, with the fires (*agní*), increase our worship  
(*bráhman*) and sacrifice; do thou, O god, stir us up to give, unto  
giving wealth.

### Notes
The second half-verse is of doubtful meaning—perhaps 'impel to us wealth  
for giving' etc.—being evidently corrupted from the better text of RV.  
(x. 141. 6; also SV. ii. 855), which reads in **c** *devátātaye* for  
*deva dā́tave*, and in **d** *rāyás* for *rayím;* even Ppp. has  
*devatātaye*. The comm. has *dānave* (rendering it "to the sacrificer  
who has given oblations") for *dātave*, also *nodaya* for *codaya*.
