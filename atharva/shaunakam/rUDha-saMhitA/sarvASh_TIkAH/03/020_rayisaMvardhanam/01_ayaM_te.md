### Translation
1. This is thy seasonable womb (*yóni*), whence born thou didst shine;  
knowing it, O Agni, ascend thou; then increase our wealth.

### Notes
The verse is found in numerous other texts: besides RV. (iii. 29. 10),  
in VS. (iii. 14 et al.), TS. (i. 5. 5² et al.), TB. (i. 2. 1¹⁶ et al.),  
MS. (i. 5. 1 et al.), K. (vi. 9 et al.), Kap. (i. 16 et al.), JB. (i.  
6l): in nearly all occurring repeatedly. VS.TS.TB.JB. differ from our  
version only by reading *áthā* for *ádhā* at beginning of **d**; Ppp.  
and the comm. have *atha;* MS.K. substitute *tátas;* but RV. gives  
further *sīda* for *roha* in **c**, and *gíras* for *rayím* in **d**.  
The comm., in accordance with the ritual uses of the verse, declares  
*ayám* at the beginning to signify either the fire-stick or the  
sacrificer himself.

This is thine ordered place of birth whence sprung to life thou shinest forth. Knowing this, Agni, mount on high and cause our riches to increase.
