### Translation
9. Let the five directions yield (*duh*) to me, let the wide ones yield  
according to their strength; may I obtain all my designs, with mind and  
heart.

### Notes
All the *pada*-mss. divide and accent *prá: ápeyam*, but SPP. emends to  
*prá: āpeyam* ⌊see *Sansk. Gram.* §850⌋; the comm. reads *āpeyam*. The  
comm. declares *urvī́s* to designate heaven and earth, day and night, and  
waters and herbs.

May heaven's five spacious regions pour their milk for me with all their might. May I obtain each wish and hope formed by my spirit and my heart.
