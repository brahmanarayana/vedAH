### Translation
10. A kine-winning voice may I speak; with splendor do thou arise upon  
me; let Vāyu (wind) enclose (*ā-rudh*) on all sides; let Tvashṭar assign  
to me abundance.

### Notes
Several of our mss. (P.M.W.O.Kp.) read *rudhām* in **c**. The comm.  
explains *ā́ rundhām* by *prāṇātmanā ”vṛṇotu*.  
  
This fourth *anuvāka* contains 5 hymns, with 40 verses, and the  
quotation from the old Anukr. is simply *daśa*.

May speech that winneth cows be mine. With splendour mount thou over me. May Vayu hedge me round about May Pushan make me pros- perous.
