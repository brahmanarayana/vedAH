### Translation
2. All desires (*kā́ma*) it fulfils, arising (*ā-bhū*), coming forth  
(*pra-bhū*), becoming (*bhū*); \[as\] fulfiller of designs, the  
white-footed sheep, being given, is not exhausted (*upa-das*).

### Notes
The precise sense of the three related participles in **b** is very  
questionable (Weber renders "da seiend, tüchtig, und kräftig"; Ludwig,  
"kommend, entstehend, lebend"); the comm. says "permeating, capable ⌊of  
rewarding⌋, increasing."

He satisfies each hope and want, prevailing, present and pre- pared. The wish-fulfilling ram, bestowed, white-footed is exhaustless still.
