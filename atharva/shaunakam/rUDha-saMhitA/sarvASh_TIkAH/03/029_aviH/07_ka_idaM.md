### Translation
7. Who hath given this to whom? Love hath given unto love; love \[is\]  
giver, love acceptor; love entered into the ocean; with love I accept  
thee; love, that for thee!

### Notes
⌊Not metrical.⌋ This "verse" and the following appear to have nothing to  
do with the preceding part of the hymn, which has 6 vss.\* (according to  
the norm of this book). This "verse" is found in a whole series of  
texts, as a formula for expiating or avoiding what may be improper in  
connection with the acceptance of sacrificial gifts. The version of TA.  
(iii. 10. 1-2, 4: also found, with interspersed explanation, in TB. ii.  
2. 5⁵, and repeated in ĀpśS. xiv. 11. 2) is nearly like ours, but omits  
the second *adāt*, and reads *kā́maṁ samudrám ā́ viśa;* that of AśS. (v.  
13. 15) has the latter reading but retains the *adāt*. That of PB. (i.  
8. 17) and K. (ix. 9) differs from ours only by having *ā ’viśat*  
instead of *ā́ viveśa*. MS. (i. 9. 4) omits the phrase *kā́maḥ samudrám ā́  
viveśa*, and reads *kā́māya* for the following *kā́mena*. And VS. (vii.  
48: with it agree śB. iv. 3. 4³² and śśS. iv. 7. 15) has as follows: *kò  
‘dāt kásmā adāt: kā́mo ‘dāt kā́māyā ’dāt: kā́mo dātā́ kā́maḥ pratigrahītā́  
kā́māi ’tát te*. ⌊See also MGS. i. 8. 9, and p. 149.⌋ Of course, the  
comm. cannot refrain from the silliness of taking *kás* and *kásmāi* as  
signifying "Prajāpati," and he is able to fortify himself by quoting TB.  
ii. 2. 5⁵, as he also quotes 5¹ for the general value of the formula;  
and even 5⁶ for the identity of kama with the ocean, although our text,  
different from that of TB., does not imply any such relation between  
them. The Anukr. scans thus; 7 + 6: 11 + 9: 9 + 4 = 46. \*⌊Cf.  
introduction to this hymn.⌋

Whose gift was this, and given to whom? Kama to Kama gave the gift. Kama is giver, Kama is receiver. Kama has passed into the sea. Through Kama do I take thee to myself. O Kama, this is thine.
