### Translation
3. Let earth accept thee, this great atmosphere; let me not, having  
accepted, be parted with breath, nor with self, nor with progeny.

### Notes
Addressed to the thing accepted (*he deya dravya*, comm.). The Anukr.  
regards pāda **c** as ending with *ātmánā*, and the *pada*-text divides  
at the same place.

He who bestows a white-hooved ram, adequate to the place he holds. Ascends to the celestial height, the heaven where tribute is not paid to one more mighty by the weak.
