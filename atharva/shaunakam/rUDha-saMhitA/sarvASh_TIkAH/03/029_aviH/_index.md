### Comment
By this offering, one is released from the payment otherwise due to Yama's councilors on admission into the other world: the ideas are not familiar from other parts of the mythology and ritual. ⌊But cf. Hillebrandt, Ved. Mythol. i. 511; Weber, Berliner Sb., 1895, p. 845.⌋ The comm. explains thus: ubhayavidhasya karmaṇaḥ ṣoḍaśasaṁkhyāpūrakaṁ yat pāpam puṇyarāśer vibhaktaṁ kurvanti, as if the sixteenth were the share of demerit to be subtracted from the merit, and cleansed away (pari-śodhay-) by Yama's assistants, etc. In c he reads muñcatu for -ti; śitipād in d he renders śvetapād. The last pāda lacks a syllable, unless we make a harsh resolution. Our text reads in b -pūrttásya; ⌊for consistency, delete one t⌋.
