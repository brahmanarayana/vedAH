### Translation
6. Like refreshing drink (*írā*), it is not exhausted; like the ocean, a  
great draught (*páyas*); like the two jointly-dwelling gods, the  
white-footed one is not exhausted.

### Notes
The comparison in **c** is so little apt that what it refers to is hard  
to see: the comm. regards the Aśvins as intended, and Weber does the  
same, understanding *savāsín* as "dressed alike" (the comm. says  
*samānaṁ nivasantāu*); Ludwig thinks of "heaven and earth"; one might  
also guess sun and moon. R. suggests the sense to be "he has gods for  
neighbors, right and left." The Anukr. appears to sanction the  
contraction *samudrá ’va* in **b**.

Like a refreshing draught, like sea, the mighty flood, he faileth not. Like the two Gods whose home is one, the ram white-footed, faileth not.
