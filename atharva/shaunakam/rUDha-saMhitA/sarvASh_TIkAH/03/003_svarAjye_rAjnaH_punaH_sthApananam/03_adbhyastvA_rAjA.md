### Translation
3. For the waters let king Varuṇa call thee; let Soma call thee for the  
mountains; let Indra call thee for these subjects (*víś*); becoming a  
falcon, fly unto these subjects.

### Notes
"For" may of course be "from" in **a** and **b**, as preferred by ⌊the  
four⌋ translators and comm. Ppp. reads, in **a, b** *varuṇo juhāva somas  
tvā ’yaṁ hvayati;* and again in **c**, *indras ivā ’yaṁ hvayati.* With  
the proper resolutions, this verse is a decent *triṣṭubh;* the Anukr.  
scans it as 11 + 10: 10 + 10 = 41. The verses in our text are wrongly  
numbered from this one on.
