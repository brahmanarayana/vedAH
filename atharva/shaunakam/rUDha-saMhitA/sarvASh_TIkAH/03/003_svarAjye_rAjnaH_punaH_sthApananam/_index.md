### Comment
Found in Pāipp. ii. (our vs. 5 coming last). Used by Kāuś. (16. 30), with the hymn next following, in a ceremony for the restoration of a king to his former kingdom. In Vāit. (9. 2), vs. 1 accompanies a morning oblation to Agni anīkavant in the sākamedha rite of the cāturmāsya sacrifice; and again (30. 27), vs. 2 is used at the end of the sāutrāmaṇī ceremony.
