### Translation
5. Let thine opponents call thee; thy friends have chosen \[thee\]  
against \[them\] (? *práti*); Indra-and-Agni, all the gods, have  
maintained for thee security (*kṣéma*) in the people (*víś*).

### Notes
The comm., and a few of SPP's mss. that follow it, have at the beginning  
*váyantu* (= *sāṁtatyena sevantām*). Several *saṁhitā*-mss. (including  
our P.M.O.Op.) read *pratijānā́ḥ;* Ppp. has the easier reading *pañca  
janāḥ*, with *hvyanti* for *-ntu*, and, in **b**, *varṣata* for  
*avṛṣata;* also it ends with *adīdharas.* As in more than one other  
case, all the mss. accent *té* in the second half-verse, and the  
pada-*mss.* puts its double stroke of *pada*-division before the word;  
and both editions read *té;* but it should plainly be *te*, as our  
translation renders, and as the comm. also explains it. The comm.  
combines in **b** *pratimitrās*, making it mean "opposing friends"; the  
combination of *vṛ* 'choose' with *prati* is strange and obscure.

Let thine opponents call thee back. Thy friends have chosen, thee again. Indra and Agni, all the Gods have kept thy home amid the tribe.
