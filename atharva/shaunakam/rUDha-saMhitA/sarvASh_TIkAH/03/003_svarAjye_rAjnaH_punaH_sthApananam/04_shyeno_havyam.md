### Translation
4. Let the falcon lead hither from far (*pára*) the one to be called,  
living exiled in others' territory (*kṣétra*); let the (two) Aśvins make  
the road for thee easy to go; settle together about this man, ye his  
fellows.

### Notes
The translation follows both previous translators, and the comm. (=  
*hvātavyam*), in implying *hávyam* in **a** instead of *havyám*  
'oblation'; yet Ppp. reads *havis*, which supports *havyám.* The comm.,  
with several of SPP's mss., has *avaruddham* in **b**; for ⌊the  
technical⌋ *aparuddhaś caran* (and *ava-gam*, 6 **d**) compare  
especially PB. xii. 12. 6.

May the hawk bring the man who must be summoned, from far away, in alien land, an exile. May both the Asvins make thy pathway easy. Come, and unite yourselves with him, ye Kinsmen.
