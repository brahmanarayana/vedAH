### Translation
4. Go asunder, ye designs of them; also, ye intents, be confounded; also  
what is today in their heart, that smite thou out from them.

### Notes
All the mss. have in **b** *cittā́ni*, as if not vocative, and SPP.  
retains the accent, while our text emends to *cittāni;* the comm.  
understands a vocative. The comm. further takes *vyākūtayas* as one  
word, explaining it as either *viruddhāḥ saṁkalpāḥ* or else (qualifying  
*devās* understood) as *śatrūṇāṁ vividhākūtyutpādakāḥ.* ⌊For **d**,  
rather, 'that of them smite thou out from \[them\].'⌋

Vanish, ye hopes and plans of theirs, be ye confounded, all their thoughts! Whatever wish is in their heart, do thou expel it utterly.
