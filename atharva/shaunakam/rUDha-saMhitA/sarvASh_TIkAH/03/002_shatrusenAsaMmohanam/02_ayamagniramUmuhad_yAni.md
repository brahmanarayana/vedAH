### Translation
2. Agni here hath confounded the intents that are in your heart; let him  
blow (*dham*) you away from \[our\] home; let him blow you forth in  
every direction.

### Notes
Ppp. has *dhamātu* for *-matu* both times. The comm. renders *amūmuhat*  
by *mohayatu*, in accordance with his doctrine that one verbal form is  
equivalent to another.
