### Translation
3. O Indra! confounding \[their\] intents, move hitherward with  
\[their\] design (*ā́kūti*); with the blast of fire, of wind, make them  
disappear, scattering.

### Notes
The second half-verse is identical with 1. 5 **b, c**. Pāda **b**  
apparently means 'take away their design, make them purposeless'; the  
comm., distorting the sense of *arvān̄*, makes it signify "go against  
\[their army\], with the design \[of overwhelming it\]." Ppp. reads  
*ākūtyā ’dhi* (i.e. *-tyās adhi?*). In our edition, restore the lost  
accent-mark over the *-dra* of *índra* in **a.**

Dazing their senses, Indra, come hitherward with the wish and will. With Agni's, Vata's furious rush drive them to every side away.
