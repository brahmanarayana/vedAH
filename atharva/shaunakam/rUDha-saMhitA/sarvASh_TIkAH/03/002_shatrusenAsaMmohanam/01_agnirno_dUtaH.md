### Translation
1. Let Agni our messenger, knowing, go against \[them\], burning against  
the imprecator, the niggard; let him confound the intents of our  
adversaries; and may Jātavedas make them handless.

### Notes
All the mss. have in **a** the false accent *praty étu* (seemingly  
imitated from 1. 2 **d**, where *hí* requires it), and SPP. retains it;  
our edition makes the necessary emendation to *práty etu*. Ppp. appears  
to have *śatrūn* instead of *vidvān* at end of **a**.

May Agni, he who knows, our envoy, meet them, burning against ill-will and imprecation. May he bewilder our opponent's senses. May Jatavedas smite and make them handless.
