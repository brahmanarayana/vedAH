### Translation
4. Let the (two) Aśvins thee first,—let Mitra-and-Varuṇa both, let all  
the gods, the Maruts, call thee; then put (*kṛ*) thy mind unto the  
giving of good things; from thence, formidable, share out good things to  
us.

### Notes
With **c** compare RV. i. 54. 9 **d**, which rectifies the meter by  
reading *kṛṣva.* The second half-verse is quite different in Ppp.:  
*sajātānāṁ madhyameṣṭhe ’ha masyā* (cf. ii. 6. 4 **c**; iii. 8. 2 **d**)  
*sve kṣetre savite vi rāja.* The third pāda is made *bhurij* by the  
change of *kṛṣva* to *kṛṇuṣva.*

First shall the Asvins, Varuna and Mitra, the Universal Gods, and Maruts call thee. Then turn thy mind to giving gifts of treasures, thence, mighty one, distribute wealth among us.
