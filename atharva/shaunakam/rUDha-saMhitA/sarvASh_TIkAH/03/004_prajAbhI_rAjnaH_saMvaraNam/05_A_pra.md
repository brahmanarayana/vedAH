### Translation
5. Run forth hither from the furthest distance; propitious to thee be  
heaven-and-earth both; king Varuṇa here saith this thus; he here hath  
called thee; ⌊therefore (*sá*)⌋ do thou come to this place.

### Notes
Ppp. has *babhūtām* for *ubhe stām* at end of **b**, and *ahvat svenam  
ehi* at end of **d**. SPP. reports all his *pada*-mss. as reading *aha*  
instead of *āha* in **c**; no such blunder has been noted in ours. His  
ms. of the comm. also appears to have *āhvat* in **d**, but doubtless  
only by an oversight of the copyist (under the next verse it gives  
*ahvat* in an identical phrase of exposition). MS. (ii. 2. 11; p. 24. 3)  
gives a *pratīka* reading *ā́ préhi paramásyāḥ parāvátaḥ*, while no  
corresponding verse is found in its text—or elsewhere, so far as is  
known, unless here.

Speed to us hither from the farthest distance. Propitious unto thee be Earth and Heaven. Even so hath Varuna this King asserted, he who himself hath called thee: come thou hither.
