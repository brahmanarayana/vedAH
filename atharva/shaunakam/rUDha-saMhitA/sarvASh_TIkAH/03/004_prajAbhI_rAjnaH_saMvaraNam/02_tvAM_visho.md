### Translation
2. Thee let the people (*víśas*) choose unto kingship (*rājyà*), thee  
these five divine directions; rest (*śri*) at the summit of royalty, at  
the pinnacle (*kakúd*); from thence, formidable, share out good things  
to us.

### Notes
The verse is found also in TS. (iii. 3. 9²) and MS. (ii. 5. 10), with  
nearly accordant differences of reading: *gā́vo ‘vŗņata rājyā́ya* in  
**a**; *tvā́ṁ havanta* (MS. *vardhanti*) *marútaḥ svarkā́ḥ* for **b**;  
*kṣatrásya kakúbhi* (MS. *kakúbbhiḥ*) *śiśriyāṇás* in **c**. TB.,  
moreover, has the second half-verse (in ii. 4. 7⁷; the first half is our  
iv. 22. 2 **a, b**), agreeing with AV. except by giving *kṣatrásya  
kakúbhis.* Ppp. further varies the word by reading *kakudhi;* it also  
has in **a** *vṛṇutām*, and for **d** *ato vasūni vi bhajāsy ugraḥ.* A  
number of the mss. (including our O.Op.) read in **a** *rā́jyāya*, as,  
indeed, they generally disagree ⌊in threefold wise⌋ as to the accent of  
this word. P.M.W. have in **a** *vṛṣatām.* The comm. renders *várṣman*  
by *śarīre, śrayasva* by *āssva.*
