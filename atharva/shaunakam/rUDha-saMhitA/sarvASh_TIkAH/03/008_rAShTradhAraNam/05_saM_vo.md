### Translation
5. We bend together your minds, together your courses (*vratá*),  
together your designs; ye yonder who are of discordant courses, we make  
you bend \[them\] together here.

### Notes
This and the following verse, not found with the others in Ppp., occur  
again below as vi. 94. 1, 2 ⌊cf. also ii. 30. 2⌋, and vs. 1 occurs in  
Ppp. xix., with the other material of our sixth book; they are so far  
discordant in subject with the preceding verses that we may fairly call  
them out of place here. This one exists in MS. (ii. 2. 6), with  
*anaṁsata* for *namāmasi*, and *sthá* for *sthána*. A RV. *khila* to x.  
191 has *jānatām* in **a** for *saṁ vratā*, *ākūtis* in **b**, and, for  
**c, d**, *asāu yo vimanā janas taṁ samāvartayāmasi.* The first  
half-verse, further, nearly accords with VS. xii. 58 **a, b**, TS. iv.  
2. 5¹ **a, b**, MS. ii. 7. 11 **a, b** (they have *vām* for *vas*, and,  
for **b**, *sám u cittā́ny ā́ ’karam*). Nearly all our *saṁhitā*-mss. read  
*-tāḥ* before *sthána*, nor is there anything in the Prāt. to prescribe  
the omission of the *visarga* in such a situation, while the comment to  
ii. 40 expressly quotes the passage as an example of the assimilation of  
it to a following initial sibilant. The comm. reads *stana* instead of  
*sthana.* Three of our mss. (P.M.E.) read at the end *-nayāmasi.*

We bend together all your minds, your vows and purposes we bend. We bend together you who stand apart with hopes opposed to ours.
