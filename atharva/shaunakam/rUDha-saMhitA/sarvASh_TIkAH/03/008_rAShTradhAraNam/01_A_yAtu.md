### Translation
1. Let Mitra come, arranging with the seasons, uniting (? *sam-veśaya-*)  
the earth with the ruddy ones (*usríyā*); then to us let Varuṇa, Vāyu,  
Agni, assign great royalty of union (? *saṁveśyà*).

### Notes
The verse is very obscure, and probably corrupt, though found almost  
without variant (only *tat* for *atha* in **c**) in Ppp. also. The  
epithet *saṁveśyà* (found only here) seems fashioned to correspond to  
the participle *saṁveśáyan* in **b**; but Weber renders the ppl. by  
"umlagernd" and the epithet by "ruhsam"; the comm., by "pervading"  
(*vyāpnuvan*) and "suitable for abiding in" (*saṁveśārham  
avasthānayogyam*). The comm. takes *usríyās* as *gāvas*, i.e. *kiraṇās*  
'rays.' R. ventures heroic emendations: "Let Mitra come after ordering  
of the time, enlivening (*saṁhāpayan* or something equivalent, since  
'putting to rest' is no result of the action of Mitra's rays) the earth  
with his rays; but let Varuṇa make wind and fire (*vāyúm agním*), make  
our great realm go to rest." The first pada is redundant, unless we make  
the double combination *mitrá rtúbhiḥ.* ⌊BR. take *kalp-* as 'sich  
richtend nach.'⌋

Let Mitra come, arranging, with the Seasons, lulling the Earth to rest with gleams of splendour. And so let Agni, Varuna, and Vayu make our dominion tran- quil and exalted.
