### Translation
2. Let Dhātar, Rāti, Savitar enjoy here (*idám*); let Indra, Tvashṭar,  
welcome my words (*vácas*); I call the divine Aditi, mother of heroes  
(*śū́ra-*), that I may be midmost man of my fellows.

### Notes
The first pada is also vii. 17. 4 **a**, and VS. viii. 17 **a**. The  
plural verb in **b** seems to imply that all the deities mentioned in  
the line are to be regarded as its subjects. *Madhyameṣṭhā́* (like  
*madhyamaśī́*, iv. 9. 4), probably the one whom the others gather about  
as chief; the comm. has nothing valuable (*samṛddhakāmaḥ san svasamānāiḥ  
sevyaḥ*). The comm. takes *rāti* in **a** as = Aryaman. Ppp. has  
*gṛhṇantu* for *haryantu* in **b**. The meter of **d** would be  
rectified by reading *syā́m* (or *ásam*, as is perhaps assumable in this  
stage of the language) for *ásāni*. The verse as it stands (11 + 12: 11  
+ 12 = 46) is ill described as a *jagatī.*
