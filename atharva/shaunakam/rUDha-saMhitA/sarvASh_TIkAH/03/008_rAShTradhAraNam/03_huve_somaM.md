### Translation
3. I call, with acts of homage. Soma, Savitar, all the Ādityas, in the  
contest for preëminence; may this fire shine for very long, kindled by  
\[my\] fellows who gainsay not.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The translation implies in **b** emendation ⌊cf. iii. 18. 4⌋ to  
*ahamuttaratvé* (against all the mss. and both editions), as proposed by  
BR., i. 891; the comm. also takes it as two words, and renders  
*uttaratvé* by *yajamānasya śrāiṣṭhye.* Ppp. reads *devān* for *ādityān*  
in **b**. The comm. has *dīdayat* in *saṁhitā;* our *pada*-text has it,  
and Prāt. iii. 22 and iv. 89 deal with its conversion to *dīdāyat* in  
*saṁhitā.*

Soma I call, and Savitar with homage, and all the Adityas in the time of contest. Long may this fire send forth its splendour, lighted by kinsmen uttering no word against me.
