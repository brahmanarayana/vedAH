### Translation
5. Fixed quarter; Vishṇu overlord; the serpent with black-spotted  
(*kalmā́ṣa-*) neck defender; the plants arrows: homage to those etc. etc.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *kulmāṣa-;* the comm. explains the word by *kṛṣṇavarṇa*. TS.  
calls the quarter *iyám* 'this'; in MS. it is *ávācī* 'downward'; TS.  
treats of it after the upward one, and makes Yama the overlord. In our  
edition, an accent-mark under the *-kṣi-* of *rakṣitā́* has slipped to  
the right, under *-tā*.
