### Translation
1. Eastern quarter; Agni overlord; black serpent defender; the Ādityas  
arrows: homage to those overlords; homage to the defenders; homage to  
the arrows; homage be to them; who hates us, whom we hate, him we put in  
your jaws (*jámbha*).

### Notes
Ppp. has *ṛṣibhyas* instead of *iṣubhyas*, and *vas* instead of  
*ebhyas;* and it adds further to the imprecation *tam u prāṇo jahātu*,  
which our text has in a similar connection at vii. 31. 1; x. 5. 25-35;  
xvi. 7. 13. The "defender" is in each case a kind of serpent; and this,  
which is but an insignificant item in our two hymns, has a more  
important bearing on the application of the corresponding TS. and MS.  
passages. The TS. passage runs thus: "thou art the eastern quarter,  
convergent by name; of thee there Agni is overlord, the black serpent  
defender; both he who is overlord and he who is guardian, to them (two)  
be homage; let them be gracious to us; whom we hate and who hates us,  
him I put in the jaws of you (two)"; and the MS. version differs only in  
one or two slight points. The comm. supplies each time to the name of  
the quarter *asmadanugrahārthaṁ vartatām* or something equivalent. There  
seems to be no natural way of dividing these verses into 5 pādas; the  
refrain is probably counted by the Anukr. as 42 syllables, and the  
addition of the other part brings the number in each verse up to from 62  
to 66 syllables (*aṣṭi* is properly 64).
