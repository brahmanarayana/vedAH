### Translation
4. Northern quarter; Soma overlord; the constrictor (*svajá*) defender;  
the thunderbolt (*aśáni*) arrows: homage to those etc. etc.

### Notes
The comm. gives for *svajá* a double explanation, either "self-born"  
(*sva-ja*) or else "inclined to embrace" (root *svaj*). Both the other  
texts assign Varuṇa as overlord; for defender, TS. designates the  
cross-lined serpent, MS. the *pṛdāku* (in the corrupt form *sṛ́dāku* or  
*-āgu:* the editor adopts the latter). Ppp. makes wind (*vāta*) the  
arrows.
