### Translation
3. Let not brother hate brother, nor sister sister; becoming accordant  
(*samyáñc*), of like courses, speak ye words auspiciously (*bhadráyā*).

### Notes
The comm. reads *dviṣyāt* in **a**. The majority of SPP's *pada*-mss.  
give *sá॰vratā* (instead of *-tāḥ*) in **c**. The comm. further reads  
*vadatu* in **d**, explaining it to mean *vadantu*.
