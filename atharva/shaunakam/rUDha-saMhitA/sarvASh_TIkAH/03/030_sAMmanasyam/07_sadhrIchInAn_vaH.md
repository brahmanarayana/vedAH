### Translation
7. United, like-minded I make you, of one bunch, all of you, by \[my\]  
conciliation; \[be\] like the gods defending immortality (*amṛ́ta*); late  
and early be well-willing yours.

### Notes
We had the first pāda above as vs. 5 **d**; emendation to *sadhrī́cas*  
would rectify the meter; the Anukr. takes no note of the metrical  
irregularity; it is only by bad scanning that he makes out any  
difference between vss. 5 and 7. The translation implies in **b**  
*-śnuṣṭīn*, which is read by SPP., with the majority of his mss., and  
supported by the comm's *ekaśnuṣṭim* (explained by him as *ekavidhaṁ  
vyāpanam ekavidhasyā ’nnasya bhuktiṁ vā*); part of our mss. also  
(Bp.E.H.Op.) read clearly *-śn-*, while others are corrupt, and some  
have plainly *-śr-*: cf. the note to 17. 2 above. Ppp. has at the end  
*susamitir vo ’stu*.

With binding charm I make you all united, obeying one sole leader and one-minded. Even as the Gods who watch and guard the Amrit, at morn and eve may ye be kindly-hearted.
