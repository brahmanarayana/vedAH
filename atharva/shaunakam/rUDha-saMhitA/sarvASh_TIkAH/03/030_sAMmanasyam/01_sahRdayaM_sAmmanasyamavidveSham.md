### Translation
1. Like-heartedness, like-mindedness, non-hostility do I make for you;  
do ye show affection (*hary*) the one toward the other, as the  
inviolable \[cow\] toward her calf when born.

### Notes
Ppp. has *sāmnasyam* in **a**, and in **c** *anyo ‘nyam*, as demanded by  
the meter. The comm. also reads the latter, and for the former  
*sāmmanuṣyam;* and he ends the verse with *aghnyās*.

Freedom from hate I bring to you, concord and unanimity. Love one another as the cow loveth the calf that she hath borne.
