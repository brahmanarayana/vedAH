### Translation
6. Your drinking (*prapā́*) \[be\] the same, in common your share of  
food; in the same harness (*yóktra*) do I join ⌊*yuj*⌋ you together;  
worship ye Agni united, like spokes about a nave.

### Notes
The comm. explains *prapā* as "drinking saloon" (*pānīyaśālā*). Two of  
our mss. (P.M.) read at the beginning *samānī́ṁ*. ⌊To reproduce (as W.  
usually does) the radical connection (here between *yóktra* and *yuj*),  
we may render 'do I harness you.' The Anukr. seems to scan 12 + 11: 9 +  
8 = 40; the vs. is of course 11 + 11: 8 + 8.⌋

Let what you drink, your share of food be common together, with one common bond I bid you. Serve Agni, gathered round him like the spokes about the chariot nave.
