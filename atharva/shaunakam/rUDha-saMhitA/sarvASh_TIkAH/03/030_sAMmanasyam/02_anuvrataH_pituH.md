### Translation
2. Be the son submissive to the father, like-minded with the mother; let  
the wife to the husband speak words (*vā́c*) full of honey, wealful.

### Notes
The translation implies at the end *śaṁtivā́m* ⌊BR. vii. 60⌋, which SPP.  
admits as emendation into his text, it being plainly called for by the  
sense, and read by the comm. (and by SPP's oral reciter K, who follows  
the coram.); this ⌊not *śaṁtivā́m*⌋ is given also by Ppp. (cf. xii. 1.  
59, where the word occurs again). The comm. further has in **b** *mātā́*  
(two of SPP's reciters agreeing with him).

One-minded with his mother let the son be loyal to his sire. Let the wife, calm and gentle, speak words sweet as honey to her lord.
