### Translation
3. The well-straightened arrow of love which dries the spleen,  
forward-winged, consuming (*vyòṣa*)—therewith I pierce thee in the  
heart.

### Notes
The accent of *vyòṣa* is anomalous ⌊*Skt. Gram.* §1148 n⌋, being rather  
that of a possessive compound ⌊§1305 a⌋; ⌊cf. vs. 4⌋. The comm. appears  
to take *plīhan* as signifying 'lung'; the obscure *prācīnapakṣa* he  
makes equivalent to *ṛjavaḥ pakṣā yasyāḥ.*

The shaft of Kama, pointed well, that withers and consumes the spleen. With hasty feathers, all aglow, therewith I pierce thee to the heart.
