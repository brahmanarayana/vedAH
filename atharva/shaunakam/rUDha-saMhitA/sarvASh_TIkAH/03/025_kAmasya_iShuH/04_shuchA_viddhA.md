### Translation
4. Pierced with consuming pain (*śúc*), dry-mouthed, do thou come  
creeping to me, gentle, with fury allayed, entirely \[mine\],  
pleasant-spoken, submissive.

### Notes
The great majority of mss. (including our Bp.P.M. W.E.I.) accent *vyóṣa*  
in this verse, which is preferable; but both editions give *vyòṣa*,  
because the mss. are unanimously for it in vs. 3 **c**. The comm.  
renders it by *vidāhayukta*. ⌊I cannot make out from W's collations that  
M.W. read *vyóṣa*⌋.

Pierced through with fiercely-burning heat, steal to me with thy parching lips, Gentle and humble, all mine own, devoted, with sweet words of love.
