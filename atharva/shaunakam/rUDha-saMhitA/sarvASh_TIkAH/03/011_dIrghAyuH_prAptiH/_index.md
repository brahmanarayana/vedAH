### Comment
The first four verses are found in Pāipp. i., with the bulk of the 4-verse hymns; they are also RV. x. 161. 1-4 (RV. adds a fifth verse, which occurs below as viii. 1. 20). The hymn is used by Kāuś. (27. 32, 33) in a general healing ceremony (without specification of person or occasion; the schol. and comm. assume to add such), and, in company with many others (iv. 13. 1 etc. etc.), in a rite for length of life (58. 11); and it is reckoned to the takmanāśana gaṇa (26. 1, note) and to the āyuṣya gaṇa (54. 11, note; but the comm., ignoring these, counts it as one of the aṅholin̄ga gaṇa). In Vāit. (36. 19), vs. 8 accompanies the setting free of the horse at the aśvamedha sacrifice; and the hymn (the edition says, i. 10. 4; the pratīkas are the same) is employed, with ii. 33 etc., in the puruṣamedha (38. 1).—⌊See also W's introduction to ii. 33.⌋
