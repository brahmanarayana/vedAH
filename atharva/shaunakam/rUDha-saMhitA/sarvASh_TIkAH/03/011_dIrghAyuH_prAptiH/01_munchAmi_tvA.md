### Translation
1. I release thee by oblation, in order to living, from unknown *yákṣma*  
and from royal *yákṣma;* if now seizure (*gráhi*) hath seized him, from  
it, O Indra-and-Agni, do ye release him.

### Notes
RV. inserts *vā* after *yádi* in **c**. Ppp. has, in the second  
half-verse, *grāhyā gṛhīto yady eṣa yatas tata ind-*. The comm. explains  
*rājayakṣma* as either "king of *yakṣmas*" or else "the *y.* that seized  
king Soma first," quoting for the latter TS. ii. 5. 6⁵ ⌊see references  
in Bloomfield's comment⌋. The first pāda is *jagatī.*
