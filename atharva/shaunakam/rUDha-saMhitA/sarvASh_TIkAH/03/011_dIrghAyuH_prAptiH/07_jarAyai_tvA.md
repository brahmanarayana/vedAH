### Translation
7. Unto old age do I commit thee; unto old age do I shake thee down  
(*ni-dhū*); may old age, excellent, conduct thee; let the other deaths  
go away, which they call the remaining hundred.

### Notes
The Anukr. scans the verse as 9 + 8: 7 + 8 + 8 = 40, not admitting any  
resolution in **c**.

I give thee over to old age, make thee the subject of old age. Let kindly old age lead thee on. Let all the other deaths, whereof men count a hundred, pass away!
