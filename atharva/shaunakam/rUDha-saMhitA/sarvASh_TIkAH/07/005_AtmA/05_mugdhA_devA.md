### Translation
5. The gods, confounded, both sacrificed with a dog and sacrificed  
variously with limbs of a cow; he who knoweth with the mind this  
sacrifice—him mayest thou proclaim to us here, here mayest thou speak.

### Notes
The second half-verse is the same with 2. 1 **c, d** above. *Tam*  
(rendered 'him') in **d** might refer grammatically to the offering  
itself, instead of to him who knows it. All the *pada*-mss. read at the  
beginning *mugdhā́* instead of *-dhā́ḥ*, as which latter the word must be  
understood, and is translated. SPP. admits *-dhā́ḥ* in his *pada*-text.  
Henry emends to *mūrdhnā* ⌊cf. also *Mém. Soc. Ling.* ix. 248⌋.
