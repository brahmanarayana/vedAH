### Comment
Found (the first two verses only) also in Pāipp. xx., and (the same verses) also in other texts, as noted below. Kāuś. takes no notice of the hymn; but it is prescribed by Vāit. (13. 13), in the agniṣṭoma ceremony, in connection with the entertainment (ātithyā) of Soma.


### Translations
Translated: Henry, 2, 49; Griffith, i. 329.
