### Translation
1. By the sacrifice the gods sacrificed to the sacrifice; those were  
the first ordinances (*dhárman*); those greatnesses attach themselves to  
(*sac*) the firmament, where are the ancient (*pū́rva*) perfectible  
(*sādhyá*) gods.

### Notes
The verse is RV. i. 164. 50,\* found also in VS. (xxxi. 16), TS. (iii.  
5. 11⁵), TA. (iii. 12. 7), MS. (iv. 10. 3), CB. (x. 2. 2³, with  
comment); ⌊*Kaṭha-hss.*, p. 83;⌋ the only variant is *sacante* for  
*sacanta* in TS.TA. "This passage and vii. 79. 2 cast light upon the  
idea of *sādhya;* there are two kinds of gods: those with Indra at their  
head and the *sādhya* 'they who are to be won' (*sādhya* 'what is to be  
brought into order, under control, or into comprehension'). They are  
thus the unknown, conceived as preceding the known. Later they are  
worked into the ordinary classification of Vasus, Rudras, etc.; and what  
was formerly a serious religious problem, a hierarchy conceived as  
possible before the now-accepted gods (something like the pre-Olympians  
with the Greeks), has become an empty name." R. \*⌊Also RV. x. 90. 16.⌋

The Gods adored the Sacrifice with worship: these were the statutes of primeval ages. Those mighty ones attained the cope of heaven, there where the Sadhyas, Gods of old, are dwelling.
