### Translation
3. As the gods sacrificed to the gods with oblation, to immortals, with  
immortal mind—may we revel there in the highest firmament; may we see  
that at the rising of the sun.

### Notes
The verse is no *pan̄kti*, but a good *triṣṭubh*.

Where the Gods worshipped Gods with their oblation, worship- ped immortals with immortal spirit, There in the loftiest heaven may we be happy, and look upon that light when Surya rises.
