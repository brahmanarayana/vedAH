### Translation
1. Weal for us let the wind blow; weal for us let the sun burn; be the  
days weal for us; \[as\] weal let the night be applied; weal for us let  
the dawn shine forth.

### Notes
The whole verse occurs in TA. iv. 42. 1, with *pavatām mātaríśvā* for  
*vātu* in **a**, and *rā́triḥ* in **d**. MS., in iv. 9. 27, has only four  
pādas, with *‘bhí* added before *vātu* in **a**. VS. has the same  
amount, our **a, b** being xxxvi. 10 **a, b** (with *pavatam* for *vātu*  
in **a**), and our **c, d** being xxxvi. 11 **a** (with *rā́triḥ* instead  
of our *rā́tri*). All have alike in **d** the strange expression *práti  
dhīyatām*. The Anukr. ignores the deficiency of two syllables in **a**.  
⌊Ppp. has *me* for *nas* all four times; also *‘bhivāte* for *vātu*, and  
*tapati* for *-tu*.
