### Translation
5. Of the sapless *śarkóṭa*, crawling on, on the ground (*nīcī́na*)—its  
poison, verily, I have taken away, likewise I have ground it up.

### Notes
The comm. reads in **c** *adiṣi* (taking it from *dā* 'cut') instead of  
*ādiṣi* (p. *asya:* *ā॰ádiṣi*). He understands the *śarkoṭa* to be a  
kind of snake; Henry renders it "scorpion" ⌊after Grill⌋.

This scorpion here that creeps along, low on the ground and powerless-- I have removed his poison and then utterly demolished him.
