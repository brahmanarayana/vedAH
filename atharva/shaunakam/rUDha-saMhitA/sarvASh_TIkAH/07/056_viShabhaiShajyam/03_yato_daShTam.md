### Translation
3. Whence bitten, whence sucked—thence do we call \[it\] out for thee;  
of the petty, hastily-biting (?) stinging insect the poison \[is\]  
sapless.

### Notes
The great majority of SPP's authorities, with some of ours (Bp.O.) read  
in **c** *triprad-*, and so also the comm., who explains it as 'stinging  
with three organs, namely, mouth, tail, and feet'; the *pada*-division  
*tṛpra॰d-* is against this (it would be *tri॰prad-*), and SPP. also  
accepts in his text *tṛpra॰d-*. The comm. further reads *nir vayāmasi*  
in **b**. He explains *yátas* in **a** as for *yátra*, 'in whatever part  
thou art bitten' etc.; and *dhītám* by *pitaṁ sarpādinā*. Ppp. reads  
*yataṣ prataṁ* at end of **a**, *nayāmasi* at end of **b**, and  
*tṛpradaṅśmano* in **c**.
