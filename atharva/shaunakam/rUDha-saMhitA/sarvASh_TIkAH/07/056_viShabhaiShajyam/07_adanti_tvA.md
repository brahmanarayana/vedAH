### Translation
7. Ants eat thee; pea-hens pick thee to pieces; verily may ye all say  
"the poison of the *śarkóṭa* is sapless."

### Notes
All SPP's *pada*-mss. read *pipī́likā* (not *-kāḥ*) in **a**. SPP.  
understands (one does not see why) the comm. to take *bhalabravātha* as  
one word; he (the comm.) glosses it with *sādhu brūta;* in **a, b** he  
makes the addressee a snake. ⌊Pischel, *Ved. Stud.* i. 62, discusses  
*bhala*.⌋

The emmets make a meal of thee and peahens tear and mangle thee: All ye are crying out, In sooth the scorpion's poison hath no strength.
