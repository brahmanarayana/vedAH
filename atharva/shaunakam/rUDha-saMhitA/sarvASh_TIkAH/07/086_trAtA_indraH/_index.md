### Comment
Wanting in Pāipp. Follows in its applications closely those of 85 (Kāuś. 59. 14, and notes to 137. 4 and 25. 36); but appears further (140. 6) in the indramahotsava, with hymn 91 and v. 3. 11, accompanying an offering of butter.


### Translations
Translated: Henry, 36, 106; Griffith, i. 372.
