### Translation
1. What food I eat in dream, \[and that\] is not found in the morning—be  
all that propitious to me, for that is not seen by day.

### Notes
The comm. appears to regard *nahí* in **c** as two independent words. A  
corresponding verse is found in ĀpśS. x. 13. 11 and HGS. i. 17. 4;  
reading thus: *yad annam adyate naktam* (H. *sāyam*) *na tat prātaḥ  
kṣudho ‘vati* (H. *av. kṣ.*): *sarvaṁ tad asmān mā hiṅsīr* (H. *-sīn*)  
*nahi tad dadṛśe divā* (H. *divā dadṛśe divaḥ*). Ppp. has *nas* instead  
of *me* in **c**.

The food that in a dream I eat is not perceived at early morn. May all that food be blest to me because it is not seen by day.
