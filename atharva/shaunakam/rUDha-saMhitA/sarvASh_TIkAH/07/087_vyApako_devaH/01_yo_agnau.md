### Translation
1. The Rudra that is in the fire (*agní*), that is within the waters,  
that entered the herbs, the plants, that shaped (*kḷp*) all these  
beings—to that Rudra, to Agni, be homage.

### Notes
TS., at V. 5. 9³, has a nearly corresponding address, but making no  
pretense to a metrical character: it reads *yó rudró agnāú* (so far,  
Ppp. agrees) *yó apsú yá óṣadīṣu* *yó rudró víśvā bhúvanā ”vivéśa  
tásmāi rudrā́ya námo astu;* thus omitting the perplexing *agnaye* at the  
end, for which Ppp. also has the better reading *adya*. The comm.  
explains *cākḷpe* by (*sraṣṭuṁ*) *samartho bhavati*. Pāda **b** is  
*triṣṭubh;* ⌊but **a** is not to be made good by pronouncing *rudró* as  
a trisyllable⌋.

To Rudra in the fire, to him who dwells in floods, to Rudra who hath entered into herbs and plants, To him who formed and fashioned all these worlds, to him this Rudra, yea, to Agni, reverence be paid!
