### Translation
1. With Indra, with fury may we overcome them that play the foe, smiting  
Vritras irresistibly.

### Notes
The verse is found also in TS. iii. 5. 3² and MS. i. 3. 12. TS. reads  
*sayújas* for *manyúnā*, and *sāsahyā́ma* for *abhí syāma;* *syāma* for  
*vayám*, *áva bādhe* for *abhi syāma*, and *ghnatā́* for *ghnántas*. Most  
of the *saṁhitā*-mss. give *ṣyāma* (our W.O., and two fifths of SPP's  
authorities, *sy-*), and both printed texts read it; but the Prāt. (ii.  
107) expressly requires *syāma*, and that accordingly should be the  
accepted text. ⌊In **c**, rather, 'smiting adversaries'?⌋
