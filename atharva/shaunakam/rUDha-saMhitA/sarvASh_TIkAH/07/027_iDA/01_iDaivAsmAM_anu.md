### Translation
1. Let Iḍā herself dress us with the vow (*vratá*), \[she\] in whose  
place {*padá*) the pious purify themselves; ghee-footed, able,  
soma-backed, she, belonging to all the gods, hath approached the  
offering.

### Notes
Or *vratá* in **a** may mean the *vrata*-milk (comm. simply *karman*).  
ĀpśS. omits *eva* and reads *ghṛtena* for *vratena* in **a**, and has  
for **c**, *vāiśvānarī śakvarī vāvṛdhānā*. The comm. reads *upā ’stṛta*  
in **d**.

May Ida with her statute dwell beside us, she in whose place the pious purge and cleanse them. She, mighty, Soma-decked, whose foot drops fatness, meet for All-Gods, hath come to aid our worship.
