### Translation
1. Let Dhātar assign (*dhā*) to us wealth, \[he\] being master (*īś*),  
lord of the moving creation; let him yield to us with fulness.

### Notes
Literally (at the end) 'with full,' to which the comm. supplies  
*dhanena*. Ppp. shows no variants. TS. (ii. 4. 5¹ et al.) has *dadātu*  
in **a**, and *vāvanat* for *yachatu* at the end. MS. ⌊iv. 12. 6⌋ has  
only **a** (with *dadhātu*), combining it with our 2 **b-d**.

May the Ordainer give us wealth, Lord, ruler of the world of life: with full hand may he give to us.
