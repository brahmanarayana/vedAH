### Translation
2. Let Dhātar assign to his worshiper an unexhausted further life; may  
we obtain the favor of the all-bestowing god.

### Notes
TS. (iii. 3. 11³), MS. (iv. 12. 6), AśS. (vi. 14. 16)\*, śśS. (ix. 28.  
3), and śGS. (i. 22), have the same verse, with sundry differences: all†  
read *dadātu* in **a**, and TS.MS. have *no rayím* for *dāśúṣe* (thus  
substituting our 1 **a**); in **b**, śśS. and śGS. have *akṣitim* at  
end; in **d**, for *viśvárādhasas*, TS. has *satyárādhasas*, MS.śśS.śGS.  
*satyádharmaṇas*, and AśS. *vājinīvatas*. Ppp. is defective in this  
verse, but presents no variants. The comm. explains *dhīmahi* once by  
*dhārayema* and once by *dhyāyema*. \*⌊So also AGS. (transl.), p. 36,  
note, as in AśS.⌋ †⌊Save MS.⌋

May Dhatar grant the worshipper henceforth imperishable life. May we obtain the favour of the God who giveth every boon.
