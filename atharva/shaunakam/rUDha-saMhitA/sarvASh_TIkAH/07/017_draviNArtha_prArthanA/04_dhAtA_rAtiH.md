### Translation
4. Let Dhātar, Rāti, Savitar enjoy this, let Prajāpati, Agni our  
treasure-lord; let Tvashṭar, Vishṇu, sharing (*rā*) together with  
progeny, assign wealth to the sacrificer.

### Notes
The beginning of this corresponds with that of iii. 8. 2, above. The  
verse is found without variant\* in TS. (1. 4. 44¹); VS. (viii. 17) and  
MS. (i. 3. 38) have different readings: in **b**, after *prajā́patir*,  
VS. *nidhipā́ devó agníḥ*, MS. *váruṇo mitró agníḥ;* in **c**, MS. begins  
*víṣṇus tváṣṭā*, VS. ends *-rarāṇā́s;* in **d**, VS. ends *dadhāta*.  
Ppp., in **d**, has *pūṣā* instead of *viṣṇus*. ⌊MP. has **c** at i. 7.  
12.⌋ \*⌊Save *nidhipátis* for *nidhípatis:* cf. *Gram.* §1267 a.⌋
