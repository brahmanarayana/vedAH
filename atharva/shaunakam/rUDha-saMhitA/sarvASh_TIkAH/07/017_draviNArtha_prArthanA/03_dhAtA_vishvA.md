### Translation
3. Let Dhātar assign all desirable things unto the progeny-wishing  
worshiper in his home; for him let the gods wrap up immortality  
(*amṛ́ta*)—all the gods, Aditi, in unison.

### Notes
This verse occurs only in TS. (iii. 3. 11³) and MS. (iv. 12. 6), both  
reading alike: for **a**, *dhatā́ dadātu dāśúṣe vásūni; mīḍhúṣe* (for  
*dāśúṣe*) in **b**; *amṛ́tāḥ sáṁ vyayantām* in **c**; and *devā́sas* in  
**d**. Ppp. gives, for **a**, *dhātā, viśvāni* ⌊which rectifies the  
meter⌋ *dāśuṣe dadātu;* for **c**, *tasyā prajām amṛtas saṁvayantu;*  
and, in **d**, *devāsas* (rectifying the meter) ⌊and confirming my  
conjecture made at the former occurrence of this pāda at iii. 22. 1  
**d**⌋.

To him may Dhatar grant all kinds of blessings who, craving children, serves him in his dwelling. Him may the Gods invest with life eternal, yea, all the Gods and Aditi accordant.
