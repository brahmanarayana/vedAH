### Translation
1. To verse (*ṛ́c*), to chant (*sā́man*) we sacrifice, by (both) which  
men perform rites (*kárman*); these bear rule at the seat (*sádas*);  
they hand (*yam*) the offering to the gods.

### Notes
The verse is SV. i. 369, which, however, reads *yacāmahe* in **a**,  
*kṛṇváte* in **b**, *ví té* for *eté* in **c**, and *vakṣataḥ* in **d**;  
GGS. iii. 2. 48, giving the *pratīka*, has *yajāmahe*. Ppp. also has  
*kṛṇvate* and *vi te*, but *yachatām* at the end. The comm. explains  
*sadasi* by *etannāmake maṇḍape*.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
    
2 (57. 1). When (*yád*) I have asked verse ⌊and⌋ chant ⌊respectively⌋  
for oblation ⌊and⌋ force, ⌊and⌋ sacrificial formula (*yájus*) for  
strength, let not therefore this Veda, asked, injure me, O lord of might  
(*śácī-*).  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
The construction of the six bare accusatives in the first line is made  
in accordance with the comm., and appears perhaps the most probable,  
though not beyond question. ⌊In **c**, Ppp. has *bhūtir*⌋ but whether  
for *eṣa* or for *tasmāt* is not clear from R's note.⌋

We worship holy Verse and Song, by which they carry out their acts, Shining in order's seat these twain present the sacrifice to Gods.
