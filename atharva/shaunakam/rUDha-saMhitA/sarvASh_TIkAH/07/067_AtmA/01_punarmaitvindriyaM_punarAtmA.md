### Translation
1. Again let sense (*indriyá*) come to me, again soul, property, and  
*bráhmaṇa* (sacred knowledge); let the fires of the sacred hearth again  
officiate just here in their respective stations.

### Notes
The verse occurs in śśS. viii. 10. 2, with *mām* for *mā* in **a**, and,  
in **c, d**, *dhiṣṇyāso yathāsthānaṁ dhārayantām ihāi ’va;* and the  
*pratīka púnar mā́m āítv indriyám* is found in TA. i. 32. 1, but might  
rather be intended to quote the parallel but quite different verse found  
at AGS. iii. 6. 8: *punar mām āitv indriyam punar āyuḥ punar bhagaḥ;  
punar draviṇam āitu mām punar brāhmaṇam āitu mām;* which MB. (i. 6. 33)  
also has, with *mā* in **c** and **d**. ⌊Cf. TA. i. 30. 1; also MGS. i.  
3. 1, and p. 152.⌋ AGS. adds a second verse, of which the first half  
corresponds with our **c, d**: *ime ye dhiṣṇyāso agnayo yathāsthānam iha  
kalpatām* ⌊cf. MGS. i. 3. 1⌋. The Anukr. seems to scan **a** and **c**  
as 7 syllables each.

May sense return to me again, and spirit, return my Sacred Power and my possessions! Again let fires, aflame on lesser altars, each duly stationed, here succeed and prosper.
