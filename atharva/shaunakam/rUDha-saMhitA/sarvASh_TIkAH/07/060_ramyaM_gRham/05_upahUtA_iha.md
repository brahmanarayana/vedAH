### Translation
5. Called on here \[are\] the kine, called on the goats and sheep;  
likewise \[is\] the sweet drink of food called on in our houses.

### Notes
The majority of authorities read *ṇaḥ* at the end (our E.O.R. have *n*);  
both editions give *naḥ* with the minority, and with the other texts  
(VS. iii. 43; Āp. vi. 27. 3; LśS. iii. 3. 1; śGS. iii. 3, 7; HGS. i. 29.  
1); the only variant is in LśS., *yo rasas* for *kīlālas* in **c**.
