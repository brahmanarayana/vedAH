### Translation
6. Be ye just here; go not after; adorn yourselves with all forms; I  
shall come along with what is excellent; become ye more abundant through  
me.

### Notes
'Go not after': that is, 'do not follow me as I go away' (so the comm.).  
The verse is used in Kāuś. (23. 6) in the ceremony of house-building, on  
the breaking of previous silence; and again (24. 16), in a rite for  
prosperity, by one setting out on a journey, contemplating the house and  
its occupants.

Full of refreshment, full of charms, of laughter and felicity, Be ever free from hunger, free from thirst! Ye Houses, fear us not. Stay here, and come not after me: prosper in every form and shape. With happy fortune will I come! Grow more abundant still through me!
