### Translation
4. Called on \[are\] they of much riches, companions, enjoying sweets  
together; be ye hungerless, thirstless; ye houses, be not afraid of us.

### Notes
Ppp. has *svādusaṁnaras* at end of **b**, and its second half-verse is  
*ariṣṭās sarvapūrṇā gṛhā nas santu sarvadā*. Āp. and HGS. (as above)  
have our **a, b**, and a **c-d** like that of Ppp., save *sarvapūruṣās*  
for *-pūrṇās* (HGS. also *bhūrisakhās* in **a**).
