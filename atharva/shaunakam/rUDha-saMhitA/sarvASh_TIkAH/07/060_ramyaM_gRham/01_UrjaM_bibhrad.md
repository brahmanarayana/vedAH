### Translation
1. Bearing sustenance (*ū́rj*), good-winning, very wise, with mild  
friendly eye, I come to the houses, well-willing, greeting; be quiet, be  
not afraid of me.

### Notes
The first and third pādas are found in VS. iii. 41, as a second  
half-verse, and also in LśS. iii. 3. 1, ĀpśS. vi. 27. 5, śGS. iii. 7.  
For *vasuvánis* in **a**, all read *vaḥ sumánās;* in **c**, their  
reading *gṛhā́n āí ’mi* (LśS. *emi*, ĀpśS. *ā ’gām*) *mánasā módamānaḥ*  
(LśS. *dāivena*). Ppp. has a very different text: *gṛhān emi mánasā  
modamāno ”rjaṁ bibhrad vasumatis sumedhā ’ghoreṇa cakṣuṣā mitriyeṇa  
gṛhāṇāṁ paśyaṅ paya ut tarāmi.* ⌊HGS. (i. 29. 1 a) and Āp. (vi. 27. 3)  
have a verse whose **c** is our **a** (but Āp. has *vaḥ suvaniḥ*), and  
whose **d** is Ppp's **a** (but Āp. has *āi ’mi*).⌋
