### Translation
3. O waters, do ye carry forth both this reproach and what is foul  
(*mála*), and what untruth I have uttered in hate, and what I have sworn  
fearlessly (?).

### Notes
The majority of our mss. (all but R.T.) accent *ā́pas* in **a**, and SPP.  
reports that three of his mss. also do the same: both texts emend to  
*āpas*. Ppp. omits *abhi* in **c**, and combines in **d** *śepe ‘bhī-*.  
The verse is found, with pervading differences of reading, as RV. i. 23.  
22, and also, less discordant, in VS. vi. 17, ĀpśS. vii. 21. 6, LśS. ii.  
2. 11. VS. differs from our text only by accenting *abhīrúṇam;* Āp. has  
*vā* for *ca* in **c** and **d**; LśS. agrees throughout. The RV. text  
is this: *idáṁ āpaḥ prá vahata yát kíṁ ca duritám máyi: yád vā ’hám  
abhidudróha yád vā śepá utā́ ’nṛtam*. The sense of our *abhī́ruṇam* at the  
end is extremely questionable; very possibly it may contain *abhi* and  
have nothing to do with the root *bhī;* it occurs only in this verse.  
The comm. explains it as *abhi* and *ruṇa* for *ṛṇa* 'debt.'

Ye Waters, wash away this stain and whatsoever taint be here, Each sinful wrong that I have done and every harmless curse of mine.
