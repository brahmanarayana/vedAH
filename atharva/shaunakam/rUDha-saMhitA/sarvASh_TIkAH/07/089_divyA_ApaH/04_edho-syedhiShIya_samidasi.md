### Translation
4. Fire-wood (*édhas*) art thou, may I be prosperous (*edh*); fuel  
(*samidh*) art thou, may I altogether prosper (*sam-edh*); brightness  
art thou, put thou brightness in me.

### Notes
⌊Prose.⌋ This address to the pieces of kindling-wood or fuel piled on  
the sacred fire, punning on the similarity of the roots *idh* 'burn' and  
*edh* 'prosper,' is found also in VS. xxxviii. 25, K. ix. 7, xxxviii. 5,  
AśS. iii. 6. 26, LśS. ii. 12. 12, śGS. ii. 10. VS. and śGS. have all  
three parts, only omitting *sám edhiṣīya* in the second\*; LśS. has only  
the first two addresses, and reads in each *edhiṣīmahi;* AśS. reads as  
LśS., but has also our third address prefixed as its first, with the  
variant *me dehi*. The Anukr. scans 8 + 9: 10 = 27. ⌊MGS. has the first  
two addresses at i. 1. 16 (cf. p. 149, 156); then follows *apo adyānv  
acāriṣam;* and *tejo ‘si* is at ii. 2. 11 (cf. p. 150).⌋ \*⌊And reading  
*edhiṣīmáhi* in the first.⌋
