### Translation
1. By this shape (*viṣṭhá*) generating exploits (*kárvara*), he verily,  
fiery, a wide way for space (? *vára*); he went up to meet the  
sustaining top (*ágra*) of the sweet; with his own self (*tanū́*) he sent  
forth (*īraya-*) a self.

### Notes
The translation given is purely mechanical. With **c** compare iv. 32. 7  
**c**. The comm., after a mystic explanation, gives as alternative  
another, accordant with the use in Kāuś., making the verse relate to a  
king who desires victory and mounts a new chariot. He understands  
*viṣṭhā* as *-ās;* our *pada*-text reads *vi॰sthā́* ⌊as does SPP's⌋. The  
other texts all agree with ours in **a, b** (but TS. understands  
*viṣṭhā́s*, MS. *viṣṭhā́*); in **c** (cf. iv. 32. 7 c), all\* have  
*dharúṇas*, TS. accents *práti*, and MS. reads *pratyán̄* (!) *āit;* for  
**d**, TS.KśS. have *svā́yāṁ yát tanúvāṁ tanū́m āírayata*, and MS.AśS.śśS.  
*svā́ṁ yát tanū́ṁ tanvā̀m āírayata*. Doubtless *āirayata* is the reading to  
be given at the end of the verse in our text; it is accepted by SPP.,  
being favored by the considerable majority of his authorities, as it is  
of ours (Bp.W.T.R.p.m. *-at*; K. has *-yanta*). Ppp. has *dharuṇe* in  
**c**. \*⌊AśS.śśS. in fact have *-am*.⌋ ⌊KśS. has *tanvām*.⌋
