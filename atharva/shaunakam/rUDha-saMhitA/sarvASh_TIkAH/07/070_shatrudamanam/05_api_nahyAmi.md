### Translation
5. I fasten back thine arms; I fasten up thy mouth; with the fury of  
terrible Agni—therewith have I smitten thine oblation.

### Notes
SPP. has at the beginning *ápi*, his authorities being equally divided  
between *ápi* and *ápa*. The majority of ours (only D. noted to the  
contrary) have *ápa*, which is decidedly to be preferred, as  
corresponding also to 4 **a**, and as less repetitious. ⌊TB. (ii. 4. 23)  
has our vs., with *ápa* again (see vs. 4) in **b**, *devásya bráhmaṇā*  
for *ghorásya manyúnā* in **c**, and *sárvam* for *téna* and *kṛtám* for  
*havís* in **d**.⌋

Behind thy back I tie thine arms, I bind a bandage on thy mouth: With the terrific Agni's wrath have I destroyed thy sacrifice.
