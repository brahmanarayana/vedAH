### Translation
2. The sorcerers, perdition, also the demon—let them smite his truth  
with untruth; let the gods, sent by Indra, disturb (*math*) his  
sacrificial butter; let not that meet with success which he yonder  
offers.

### Notes
TB. (as above) omits the meter-disturbing *devā́s* in **c**, and reads,  
in '**d**, *sámṛddhim* (error for *sám ardhi?*), and, at the end,  
*karóti*. The comm. understands at the beginning *yātudhā́nā* (as fem.  
sing.). The verse (11 + 11: 13 + 11) is in no proper sense *jagatī*.

For him may sorcerers, Destruction, demons strike and prevent fulfilment through their falsehood. Let Gods, by Indra sent, destroy his butter, and let his sacrifice be ineffective.
