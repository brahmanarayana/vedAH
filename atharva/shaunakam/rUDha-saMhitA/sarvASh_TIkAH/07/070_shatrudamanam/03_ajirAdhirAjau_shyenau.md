### Translation
3. Let the two speedy over-kings, like two falcons flying together,  
smite the sacrificial butter of the foeman, whosoever shows malice  
against us.

### Notes
The comm. understands in **a**, 'two messengers of death, thus styled';  
the meaning is obscure. Almost all the authorities (save our R.?T., and  
this doubtless by accident) have at the end *-aghāyánti;* the comm.,  
however, reads *-yáti*, as do, by emendation, both the edited texts.
