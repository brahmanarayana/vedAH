### Translation
1. Whatsoever he yonder offers with mind, and what with voice, with  
sacrifices, with oblation, with sacred formula (*yájus*), that let  
perdition, in concord with death, smite, his offering, before it comes  
true.

### Notes
That is, before its objects are realized (comm. *satyabhūtāt karmaphalāt  
pūrvam*). This verse and the next are found also in TB. ii. 4. 2¹⁻²,  
which reads here, at end of **b**, *yájuṣā havírbhiḥ* (Ppp. has the  
same); in **c**, *mṛtyúr nírṛtyā saṁvidānáḥ*, and, for **d**, *purā́  
diṣṭā́d ā́hutīr asya hantu;* Ppp. has, for **d**, *purā dṛṣṭā rājyo hantv  
asya* intending *dṛṣṭād ājyam?*⌋.

Whatever sacrifice that man performeth with voice, mind, sacred formula, oblation, May, in accord with Death, Destruction ruin his offering before it gain fulfilment.
