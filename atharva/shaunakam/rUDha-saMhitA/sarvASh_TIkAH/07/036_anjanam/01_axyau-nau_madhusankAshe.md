### Translation
1. The eyes of us two \[be\] of honey-aspect; our face \[be\] ointment;  
put (*kṛ*) thou me within thy heart; may our mind verily be together.

### Notes
The comm. begins with *aksāu*, and Ppp. also reads the same. The  
*pada*-text divides *sahā́ ’sati* into *sahā́: ásati*, which is plainly  
wrong (should be *asati*).

Sweet are the glances of our eyes, our faces are as smooth as balm, Within thy bosom harbour me; one spirit dwell in both of us!
