### Translation
1. O Agni-and-Vishnu, great \[is\] that greatness of yours; ye drink of  
the ghee that is called secret, assuming seven treasures in each house;  
may your tongue move on to meet the ghee.

### Notes
TS. has, in **b**, the imperative *vītám*, and śśS. *pātam*, and both  
*gúhyāni*, which makes of *nā́ma* an accus. pl.; at the end, TS. has  
*caraṇyet*, and śśS. *-ṇyat;* and both *dádhānā* at end of **c**: śśS.  
further exchanges 1 **c** and 2 **c**, and has *upa* for *prati* at  
beginning of **d**. MS. mixes up the material of the two verses still  
more, putting our 1 **b, c** after our 2 **a** in iv. 10. 1, and our 2  
**b, c** after our 1 **a** in iv. 11. 2 (in iv. 10. 1 it reads *gúhyāni*  
and *dádhānā*, like the other two texts, the *pāthás*, like ours); in  
**d** (iv. 11. 2), it has *ánu* (the text wrongly *nú*) instead of  
*práti*, and at the end *-ṇyat*. KB. (vii. 2) has two pādas resembling  
**d** (one with *upa* and one with *prati* at the beginning, and both  
ending with *caraṇyat*). With **b** compare further RV. iv. 58. 1 **c**,  
and with **c** RV. v. 1. 5 ⌊**c** and vi. 74. 1 **c**⌋. Ppp. exchanges  
the place of 1 **b** and 2 **b**, and reads in the former (like śśS.)  
*pātam* and *guhyāni* see my addition to note to vs. 2⌋.

This is your glorious might, Agni and Vishnu! Ye drink the essence of the mystic butter. Placing in every home seven costly treasures. Let your tongue stretch to take the offered fatness.
