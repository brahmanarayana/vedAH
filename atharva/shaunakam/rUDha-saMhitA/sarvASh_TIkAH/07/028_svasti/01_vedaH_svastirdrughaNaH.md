### Translation
1. The *vedá* \[is\] well-being, the tree-smiter well-being; the rib  
\[is\] sacrificial hearth (*védi*), the ax our well-being;  
oblation-making, worshipful, lovers of the offering, let those gods  
enjoy this offering.

### Notes
The first half-verse corresponds to the initial clauses of TS. iii. 2.  
4¹: *sphyáḥ svastír vighanáḥ svastíḥ párśur védiḥ paraśúr naḥ svastíḥ*.  
By the *vedá* is doubtless here meant the bunch of sacred grass so  
called, used in the ceremonies of offering (*darbhamuṣṭi*, comm.). The  
*ṇ* of *drughaṇas* (p. *dru॰ghanaḥ*) is prescribed by Prāt. iii. 76. The  
comm. explains it by *lavitrādiḥ*, because *drur drumo hanyate ‘nena*.  
Half of SPP's authorities accent *páraśus* the first time, and of ours  
all but one ( D. ), and we accordingly adopted that reading in our text,  
as it seemed very unlikely that it would be so distinguished from  
*paraśús* in the same pāda without reason—and the reason in fact seems  
to be that it stands for *párśus* (TS.) ⌊which pronunciation the meter  
decidedly favors—for the *suastí* at the end of **b** must scan as 3  
syllables⌋. SPP. accents *paraśús* both times. The comm. apparently  
understands *páraśus*, as he explains it as *parśuḥ pārśvavan̄kris*  
⌊*tṛṇādicchedanī*⌋, but the second *paraśús* by *vṛkṣacchedanasādhana*.  
He takes away the strange inconsistency in the use of *svasti* by  
reading (like TS.) *svastiḥ* at end of **b**. ⌋Discussions of  
*drughaṇa:* Geldner, *Ved. Stud.* ii. 3; von Bradke, ZDMG. xlvi. 462;  
Bloomfield, ib. xlviii. 546; Franke, WZKM. viii. 342.⌋ ⌊In **b**, Ppp.  
reads *paraśur vediṣ paraśu nas svasti*, and, in **d**, *havir idaṁ* for  
*yajñam imaṁ.*⌋

Blest be the Broom, may the Mace bring a blessing, and may the Altar and the Hatchet bless us. Worshipful Gods, may they accept this worship, lovers of sacri- fice, and sacrificers.
