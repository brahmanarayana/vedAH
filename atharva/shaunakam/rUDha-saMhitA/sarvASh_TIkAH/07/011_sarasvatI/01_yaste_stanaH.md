### Translation
1. Thy broad thundering, which, exalted, a sign of the gods, spreads  
over (? *ā-bhūṣ*) this all—do not, O god, smite our grain with the  
lightning, and do not smite \[it\] with the sun's rays.

### Notes
Sundry of the mss. (including our Bp.²P.M.E.O.) read *riṣvás* in **a**  
(P.M. *yā* before it); the comm. has *ruṣvas*. The latter explains *ā  
bhūṣati* as = *vyāpnoti*. Some mss., as usual, retain the *ḥ* of  
*pṛthúḥ* before *stan-*.
