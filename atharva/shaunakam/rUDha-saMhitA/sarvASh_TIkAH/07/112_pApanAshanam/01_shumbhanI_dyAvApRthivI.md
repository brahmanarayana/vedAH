### Translation
1. Beautiful (*śúmbhanī*) \[are\] heaven and earth, pleasant near by, of  
great vows; seven divine waters have flowed; let them free us from  
distress.

### Notes
The epithets in the first half-verse are found only here,\* and are  
obscure; for *ántisumne* the comm. substitutes *antaḥsvapne;*  
*śúmbhanī*† he renders by *śobhākāriṇyāu*, and *mahivrate* by *mahat  
karma yayoḥ*. Henry would rectify the meter of **c** by reading *ā́* for  
*ā́pas*. The verse is repeated below as xiv. 2. 45. \*⌊*Máhivrata* occurs  
elsewhere.⌋ †⌊BR. conjecture *śúndhanī:* cf. note to vi. 115. 3.⌋
