### Comment
Wanting in Pāipp. Used in Kāuś. (32.3) in a remedial rite, with vii. 29 etc.: see under 29; it is also reckoned to the aṅholin̄ga gaṇa (note to 32. 27). The comm. regards it as quoted by Kāuś. (78. 10); but doubtless the verse there intended is the equivalent xiv. 2. 45.


### Translations
Translated: Henry, 44, 122; Griffith, i. 382.
