### Translation
1. Let the spouses of the gods, eager, help us; let them help us forward  
unto offspring (? *tují*), unto winning of booty (*vā́ja*); they that are  
of earth, they that are in the sphere (*vratá*) of the waters—let those  
well-invoked goddesses bestow on us protection.

### Notes
The translation implies the accent *devī́s* in **d**. The other texts  
read accordantly *devīḥ suhavāḥ* and *yachata;* ours substitutes  
*yachantu* and adapts *suhávās* to it, but absurdly leaves *devīs*  
vocative. The comm. reads *yacchatu* at the end; he explains *tujáye* by  
*tokāyā ’patyāya*.

May the Gods' Consorts aid us of their own free will, help us to offspring and the winning of the spoil. May Goddesses who quickly listen shelter us, both those on earth and they within the waters' realm.
