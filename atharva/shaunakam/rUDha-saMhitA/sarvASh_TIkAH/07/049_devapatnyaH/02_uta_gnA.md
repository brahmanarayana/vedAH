### Translation
2. And let the women (*gnā́*) partake (*vī*), whose husbands are  
gods—Indrāṇī, Agnāyī, Aśvinī the queen; let Ródasī, let Varuṇānī listen;  
let the goddesses partake, \[at\] the season that is the wives'.

### Notes
The other texts offer no variants, save that the RV. *pada*-text  
unaccountably reads in **c** *ródasī íti*, as if the word were the  
common dual, instead of a proper name. The verse can be read as of 40  
syllables.

May the Dames, wives of Gods, enjoy our presents, Rat, Asvini Indrani and Agnayi; May Rodasi and Varunani hear us, and Goddesses come at the matrons' season.
