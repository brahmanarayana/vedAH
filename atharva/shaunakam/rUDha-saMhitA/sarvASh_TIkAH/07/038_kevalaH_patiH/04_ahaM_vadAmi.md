### Translation
4. I am speaking; not thou; in the assembly verily do thou speak; mayest  
thou be mine wholly; mayest thou not make mention of other women.

### Notes
Ppp. has, in **a**, *vadāni mahattvam*, and *vadāni* would be a  
preferable reading, but it is given by only one of our mss. (D.) and  
three of SPP's, and is not admitted in either printed text. All the mss.  
(except our I.) accent *váda* at end of **b**, which accent SPP.  
accordingly properly enough accepts; the accent is no more anomalous  
than that of *kīrtáyās* in **d**: which, however, we might regard as  
imitated after 37. 1 **d** above, where the same half-verse is found  
nearly unchanged.

I am the speaker here, not thou: speak thou where the assembly meets. Thou shalt be mine and only mine, and never mention other dames.
