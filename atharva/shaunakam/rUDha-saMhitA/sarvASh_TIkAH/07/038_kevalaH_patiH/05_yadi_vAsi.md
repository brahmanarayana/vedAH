### Translation
5. If thou art either beyond people, or if beyond streams, may this  
herb, having as it were bound \[thee\], conduct thee in hither to me.

### Notes
With *tirojanám* compare the oftener used *atijanám\*;* the virtual  
meaning is 'in uninhabited regions.' Ppp. makes better meter in **c** by  
reading *iyaṁ tvā mahyam oṣadhiḥ.* The comm. curiously reads  
*tirocanam*, "with concealed going" ⌊*tiras* and *acanam*⌋. The meter of  
the second half-verse is too irregular to be passed unnoticed. \*⌊See  
OB. vii. 385 and BR. i. 94.⌋  
  
⌊Henry, in his note, conjectures that a plant was fastened to the man  
before his departure in order to ensure his return to the woman. Later,  
1897, JA. 9. ix. 328, he cites a symbolic practice, reported by Prince  
Henri d'Orléans from the Upper Irawadi: a young woman fastens a hempen  
cord on the arm of her husband, who is about to be separated from her  
for a time, and he does the like. This seems to him (and to me) to  
confirm his view.—OB., under *suvarcalā*, reports that some assign to  
the word the meaning "hemp." Cf. my addition to note to vs. 1.⌋  
  
With this hymn ends the third *anuvāka*, containing 16 hymns and 31  
verses; the Anukr. quotations are, for the hymns, *tṛtīyāntyāu* ⌊cf.  
*anuvāka*-note following h. 118⌋ *ṣoḍaśa*, and for the verses *aṣṭāu  
tisraś cā ’vabodhyās tṛtīye*.

If thou art far away beyond the rivers, far away from men, This Herb shall seem to bind thee fast and bring thee back my prisoner.
