### Translation
3. O stem of soma, lord of fighters! not-deficient verily art thou by  
name; make me, O first-sight (*darśá*), not-deficient, both by progeny  
and by riches.

### Notes
The *darśá* is the slender crescent of the new moon when first visible,  
and here compared with one of the stems or sprouts from which the soma  
is pressed, and which swell up when wetted, as the crescent grows. The  
identification of the moon and soma underlies the comparison. The comm.  
first understands the planet Mercury (called, among other names,  
*somaputra* 'son of the moon') to be addressed, and explains the verse  
on that basis, and then gives a second full explanation on the  
supposition that the address is to the moon itself.
