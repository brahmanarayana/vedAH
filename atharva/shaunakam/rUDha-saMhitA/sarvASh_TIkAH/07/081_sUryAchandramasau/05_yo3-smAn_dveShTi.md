### Translation
5. He who hateth us, whom we hate—with his breath do thou fill thyself  
up; may we fill ourselves up with kine, with horses, with progeny, with  
cattle, with houses, with riches.

### Notes
⌊Prose.⌋ The mss. read in **c** *pyāśiṣīmahi*, which SPP. accordingly  
adopts in his text, although it is an obvious and palpable misreading  
for *pyāsiṣīmahi* (which the comm. gives); *pyāsiṣīmahi* is found in  
many texts (VS.TA.śśS.śGS.HGS.), but also *pyāyiṣīmahi* (as *iṣ*-aorist  
from the secondary root-form *pyāy*) in ĀpśS. (iii. 4. 6). It is by an  
error that our printed text has *pyāyiṣ-* ⌊instead oi *pyāsiṣ-*: see  
*Gram.* §914 b⌋. These two prose "verses" are very ill described by the  
Anukr.

Inflate thee with his vital breath who hathes us and whom we detest. May we grow rich in steeds and kine, in children, cattle, houses, wealth.
