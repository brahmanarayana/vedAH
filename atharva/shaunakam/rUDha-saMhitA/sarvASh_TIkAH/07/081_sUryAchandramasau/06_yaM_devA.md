### Translation
6. The stem which the gods fill up, which, unexhausted, they feed upon  
unexhausted—therewith let Indra, Varuṇa, Brihaspati, shepherds of  
existence, fill us up.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The verse is found also in TS. (ii. 4. 14¹), MS. (iv. 9. 27; 12. 2),  
śśS. (v. 8. 4): in **a**, all read *ādityā́s*, thus rectifying the meter,  
and MS. has *yáthā* before it, and also at beginning of **b**, with a  
correlative *evá* at beginning of **c**; in **b**, all end with  
*ákṣitayaḥ píbanti*, and MS.śśS. have *ákṣitim* before it; in **c**,  
TS.śśS. give *no rā́jā* for *asmā́n índraḥ*. The late idea of the  
subsistence of the gods upon the moon is to be seen in the verse. The  
Anukr. seems to balance deficient a with redundant **c**.  
  
With this hymn ends the seventh *anuvāka*, of 8 (or 9) hymns and 31  
verses; the quoted Anukr. says of the verses *triṅśad ekā ca saptamaḥ;*  
and, of the hymns, *saptamāv* ⌊is this to be joined with the colophon of  
the fifth *anuvāka*, p. 428? thus, *pañcamasaptamāv*⌋ *aṣṭāu*.
