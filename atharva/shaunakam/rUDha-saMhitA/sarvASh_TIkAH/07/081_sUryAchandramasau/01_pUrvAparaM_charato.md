### Translation
1. These two move on one after the other by magic (*māyā́*); two playing  
young ones (*śíśu*), they go about the sea; the one looks abroad upon  
all beings; thou, the other, disposing the seasons art born new.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Said of the sun and moon. This and the next following verse are RV. x.  
85. 18, 19, and are also found in MS. iv. 12. 2; this one, further, in  
TB. ii. 7. 12² (repeated in ii. 8. 93): all read *adhvarám* (for  
*‘rṇavám*) at end of **b**; they have, for **c**, *víśvāny anyó bhúvanā  
’bhi-* (but MS. *vi-*) *cáṣṭe*, and, at end of **d**, *jāyate* (the  
comm. also has *jāyate*) *púnaḥ;* and TB. combines *ṛtū́n an-*. Repeated  
below as xiv. i. 23 and (**a, b, c**) xiii. 2. 11 ⌊on the latter verse  
Henry has an elaborate comment, *Les Hymnes Rohitas*, p. 38-40⌋. ⌊As for  
the thrice occurring haplography, *víśvānyó* for *víśvānyanyó*, cf. iv.  
5. 5, note.⌋ Too irregular (11 + 12: 9 + 12 = 44) to be passed simply as  
*triṣṭubh*. ⌊The other texts suggest the true rectification of the meter  
of **c**.⌋

Forward and backward by their wondrous power move these two youths, disporting, round the ocean. One views all living things, and thou, the other, art born again arranging times and seasons.
