### Translation
2. O Indra-and-Varuṇa, of the bull soma, most rich in sweet, pour in, ye  
bulls; here is your beverage (*ándhas*), poured about; sitting on this  
*barhís*, do ye revel.

### Notes
RV. fills out the meter and sense of **c** by adding at the end *asmé*  
(the Anukr. ignores the deficiency), and Ppp. seems to read *idaṁ vām  
asme pariṣiktam andhā ”sad-* etc.; it also has *vṛṣetā* at end of **b**.  
The comm. explains *ā vṛṣethām* by *āśnītam*, quoting śB. ii. 4. 2. 20  
as authority.

O Indra Varuna, drink your fill, ye heroes, of this effectual and sweetest Soma. This juice was shed by us that ye might quaff it. On this trimmed grass be seated and rejoice you.
