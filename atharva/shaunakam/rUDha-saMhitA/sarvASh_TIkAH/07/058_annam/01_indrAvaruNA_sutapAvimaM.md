### Translation
1. O Indra-and-Varuṇa, soma-drinkers, this pressed soma, intoxicating,  
drink ye, O ye of firm courses; let your chariot, the sacrifice (?  
*adhvará*), for the god-feast, approach toward the stall (*svásara*), to  
drink.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
RV. reads *-vratā*, at end of **b**, *adhvarám* (which is much better)  
in **c**, and *yāti* in **d**. Ppp. has *‘dhvaram* in **c**, with *ayo*  
for *yuvó* ⌊p. *yuvóḥ*⌋ and *yāhi* in **d**. The comm. explains  
*adhvaras* as *hiṅsārahitas*, qualifying *rathas*, and *svásaram* as =  
*yajamānasya gṛham*.
