### Translation
2. Whatever very inimical mortal, O Maruts, desires to smite us, O good  
ones, across \[our\] intents, let that man put on the fetters of hate;  
smite ye him with the hottest heat.

### Notes
*Tirāś cittā́ni*, in **b**, is an obscure and doubtful expression; Henry  
renders "without our suspecting it." The RV. text (with which MS. agrees  
throughout) omits *mártas* in **a**, inserting *abhí* after *marutas;*  
in **c**, it has *sá mucīṣṭa* for *muñcataṁ sá*, and, in **d**,  
*hánmaná* for *tápasā*. T.S. makes *marutas* and *vasavas* exchange  
places in **a** and **b**, reads in **b** *satyā́ni* (for *cittā́ni*) and  
*jíghāṅsāt*, and has in **c** *pā́śam práti sá mucīṣṭa*. Ppp. has, for  
**c, d**, *tasmin tān pāśān prati muñcata yūyaṁ tapiṣṭhena tapasām  
aśvinā śam*. SPP. reads, in **c, d**, *sás táp-*, with half his  
authorities; we have noted no such reading in ours, and it appears to be  
unparalleled elsewhere. The verse (11 + 12: 10 + 11 = 44) is irregular,  
but sums up as *triṣṭubh*.

Maruts, the man who filled with rage against us beyond our thoughts would harm us, O ye Vasus, May he be tangled in the toils of Mischief: smite ye him down with your most flaming weapon.
