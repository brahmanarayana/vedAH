### Comment
The first and fourth verses are found also in Pāipp. i. The hymn is used in the same manner as the preceding one (Kāuś. 5. 5; Vāit. 1. 16), but on full-moon day; it also appears (Kāuś. 59. 19) with hymn 17 etc. For the separate use of vs. 3, see under that verse.


### Translations
Translated: Henry, 32, 101; Griffith, i. 367. See also Zimmer, p. 365 (vss. 1-2).
