### Translation
2. The men-beholding falcon, heavenly eagle, thousand-footed,  
hundred-wombed, vigor-giving—may he confirm to us the good that was  
borne away; let ours be what is rich in *svadhā́* among the Fathers.

### Notes
That is, probably, 'a pleasant life.' Ppp. makes *nṛcakṣās* and  
*suparṇas* exchange places in **a**, and reads *vayo dhāt* at end of  
**b**. Pāda **c** is *jagatī*.
