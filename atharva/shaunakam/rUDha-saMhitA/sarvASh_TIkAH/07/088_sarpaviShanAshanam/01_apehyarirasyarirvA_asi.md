### Translation
1. Go away! enemy (*ári*) art thou; enemy verily art thou; in poison  
hast thou mixed poison; poison verily hast thou mixed; go away straight  
to the snake; smite that!

### Notes
It can be seen in Ppp. that the combination *arir vā ’si* is made.  
Addressed to the poison (comm.), or to the wisp of grass that wipes it  
off (Henry)—or otherwise. The "verse" (12: 14: 10 = 36) is *bṛhatī* only  
in number of syllables. ⌊The comm. reads *abhyupehi*. He takes the  
"that" to mean the snake. With regard to the auto-toxic action of  
snake-venoms, see note to v. 13. 4.⌋

Depart! thou art a foe, a foe. Poison with poison hast thou mixt, yea, verily poison hast thou mixt. Go to the serpent: strike him dead.
