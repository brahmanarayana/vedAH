### Translation
2. Forth from here let anxieties go, forth regrets (? *anudhyā́*), and  
forth imprecations; let Agni smite the she-demoniacs; let Soma smite the  
abusers (f.).

### Notes
⌊in the edition, the final *r*-sign of *rakṣasvínīr* has slipped to the  
left from its place over the syllable *ha-*. The vs. seems to belong to  
h. 115: see note to the preceding vs.⌋
