### Translation
2. We know thy name, O assembly; verily sport (*naríṣṭā*) by name art  
thou; whoever are thine assembly-sitters, let them be of like speech  
with me.

### Notes
Ppp. reads very differently: *veda vāi sabhe te nāma subhadrā ’si  
sarasvati: atho ye te sabhāsadaḥ suvācasaḥ*. Our Bp. also reads  
*súvācasas*. The comm. takes *nariṣṭā* as *na-riṣṭā* 'not injured.' The  
Anukr. ignores the deficiency of **a**, as the redundancy of 3 **a**.
