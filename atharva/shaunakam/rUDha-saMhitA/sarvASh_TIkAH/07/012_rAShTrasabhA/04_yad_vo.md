### Translation
4. Your mind that is gone away, that is bound either here or here—that  
of you we cause to turn hither; in me let your mind rest.

### Notes
This verse does not appear to have anything to do with the rest of the  
hymn.

Whether your thoughts are turned away, or bound and fastened here or there, We draw them hitherward again: let your mind firmly rest on me.
