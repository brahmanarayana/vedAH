### Translation
1. On the forward road of the roads hath Pūshan been born, on the  
forward road of heaven, on the forward road of the earth; unto both the  
dearest stations, both hither and yon, goeth he, foreknowing.

### Notes
The verse is, without variation, RV. x. 17. 6 (also TB. ii. 8. 5³, and  
MS. iv. 14. 16, the latter with *ájaniṣṭa* accented).

Pushan was born to move on distant pathways, on roads remote from earth, remote from heaven. To both most lovely places of assembly he travels and returns with perfect knowledge.
