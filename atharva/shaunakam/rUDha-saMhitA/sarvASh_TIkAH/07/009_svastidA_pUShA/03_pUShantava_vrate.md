### Translation
3. O Pūshan, in thy sphere (*vratá*) may we at no time soever be harmed;  
thy praisers are we here.

### Notes
RV. vi. 54. 9 differs from this verse only by the accent *kádā* in  
**b**; VS. (xxxiv. 41) is the same with RV.; TB. (ii. 5. 5⁵) has *kadā́*,  
and combines at the beginning *pū́ṣaṅs táva*. SPP. reports three of his  
authorities as reading *nā́* at beginning of **b**.
