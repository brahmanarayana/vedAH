### Comment
Found also (except d) in Pāipp. xx. It is, without variant, RV. ix. 67. 29 (which also lacks d). Used by Kāuś. twice (58. 3, 11) in rites for length of life (on account of the concluding pāda), with iii. 31, iv. 13, and other passages, in the ceremony of initiation of a Vedic student. It is reckoned (54. 11, note) to the āyuṣya gaṇa.
