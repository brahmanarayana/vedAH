### Translation
1. Unto the dear, wonder-working, young, oblation-increasing one have  
we gone, bearing homage; long life-time let him make for me.

### Notes
The verse is in RV. addressed to Soma. The comm. understands it here of  
Agni. He explains *pánipnatam* as *śabdāyamānaṁ stūyamānaṁ vā*.

We bringing homage have approached the friend who seeks our wondering praise, Young, strengthener of the sacrifice. May he bestow long life on me.
