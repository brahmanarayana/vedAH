### Translation
2. Track-knowing are ye, staying (*rámati*), united, all-named; come  
unto me, ye divine ones, with the gods; to this stall, this seat;  
sprinkle us over with ghee.

### Notes
*Ramati* is called by the comm. a *gonāman;* to "united" he adds "with  
their calves, or with other kine." ⌊The Anukr. seems to scan 8 + 7: 10:  
8 + 8.⌋
