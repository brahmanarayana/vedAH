### Translation
1. Rich in progeny, shining in good pasture, drinking clear waters at a  
good watering-place—let not the thief master you, nor the evil-plotter;  
let Rudra's weapon avoid you.

### Notes
Repeated here from iv. 21. 7; for the parallel passages with their  
variants etc., see the note to that verse.

Let not a thief or wicked man possess you: let not the dart of Rudra come anear you, Prolific, shining in the goodly pasture, drinking at pleasant pools the limpid water.
