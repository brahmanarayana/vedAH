### Translation
2. He, \[as a\] son, knows his father, he his mother; he is (*bhuvat*) a  
son (*sūnú*), he is one of generous returns (? *púnarmagha*); he  
enveloped the sky, the atmosphere, he the heaven (*svàr*); he became  
this all; he came to be here (*ā-bhū*).

### Notes
This verse is found also in TS. (ii. 2. 12¹) and TB. (iii. 5. 7²), with  
difference of reading only in the second half, where they have *āúrṇod  
antárikṣaṁ sá súvaḥ sá víśvā bhúvo abh-*. Ppp. so far agrees with them  
as to have, for **d**, *viśvām bhuvo ‘bhavat svābhuvat*. The comm., in  
**b**, takes *punarmaghas* first as two separate words (*magha* =  
*dhana*) and then as a compound, "with wealth repeatedly increased in  
spite of giving of much wealth to his praisers." The comment to TS. says  
*punaḥ-punar yajamānāya dātavyaṁ dhanaṁ yasya*. The verse lacks two  
syllables of being a full *jagatī*.

Well knows this son his sire, he knows his mother well: he hath been son, and he hath been illiberal. He hath encompassed heaven, and air's mid-realm, and sky; he hath become this All; he hath come nigh to us.
