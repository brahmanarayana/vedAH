### Translation
1. They either who by meditation led the beginning (*ágra*) of speech,  
or who by mind spoke righteous things (*ṛtá*)—they, increasing with the  
third incantation (*bráhman*), perceived (*man*) with the fourth the  
name of the milch cow.

### Notes
The book, like some of those preceding, begins with mystic, obscure, and  
un-Atharvanic material. The comm. has no idea what it means, and sets  
forth his ignorance at immense length, giving about five quarto pages of  
exposition to this first hymn, with wholly discordant alternative  
explanations. The verse occurs also in śśS. (xv. 3. 7), with  
*saṁvidānās* for *vāvṛdhānās* in **c**, and *manvata* in **d**. For  
*’vadann* in **b** Ppp. has *vadeyann*, and *turyeṇa* at beginning of  
**d**. For pāda **a** cf. RV. x. 71. 1; for **d**, RV. iv. 1. 16 and v.  
40. 6. The commentary to Prāt. i. 74 quotes *dhītī́* as an *ī*-form with  
non-*pragṛhya* final, because not locative; and the *pada*-text does not  
treat it as *pragṛhya*.

They who by thought have guided all that Speech hath best, or they who with their heart have uttered words of truth, Made stronger by the strength which the third prayer bestows, have by the fourth prayer learned the nature of the Cow.
