### Translation
5. Anumati hath come unto this well-born offering, in order to \[our\]  
abounding in fields and in heroes; for her forethought (*prámati*) hath  
been excellent; let her, god-shepherded, aid this offering.

### Notes
Ppp. has a different first half: *ā no devy anumatir jagamyāt sukṣatrā  
vīratā yā sujātā;* ⌊its **d** appears to be *sa imaṁ yajñaṁ bhavatu  
nevajuṣṭā*, intending perhaps *avatu devajuṣṭam:* Roth's collation is  
not quite consistent with his note.⌋ Neither this verse nor the next has  
any *jagatī* character. ⌊For **b**, the Ppp. version suggests that the  
original reading may have been *sukṣetrá suvīrátāyāi sújātā:* cf. Roth,  
*Ueber gewisse Kürzungen im Wortende im Veda*, page 6.⌋

Anumati hath come to this our worship well-formed to give good lands and valiant heroes: For her kind care hath blessed us. God-protected, may she assist the sacrifice we offer.
