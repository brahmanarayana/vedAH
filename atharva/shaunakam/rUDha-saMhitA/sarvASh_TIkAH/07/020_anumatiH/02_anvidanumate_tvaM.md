### Translation
2. Mayest thou, indeed, O Anumati, approve, and do thou make weal for  
us; enjoy thou the offered oblation; grant us progeny, O goddess.

### Notes
The first half-verse, with a wholly different second half, is found in  
the same texts that have vs. 1 (VS. xxxiv. 8; the others as quoted  
above: also K. xiii. 16): all read *mányāsāi* instead of *máṅsase*, and  
TS. combines *naḥ kṛdhi*. Ppp. has, for **c, d**, *iṣas tokāya no dadhat  
pra ṇa āyūṅṣi tāriṣat*, of which the last pāda agrees\* with the other  
texts (they have, for **c**, *krátve dákṣāya no hinu*). The comm. reads  
*maṅsiṣe* for *-sase*, both here and in 6 **d**. Our last half-verse is  
also 68. 1 **c, d**, and nearly 46. 1 **c, d**. \*⌊But VS.TS.śśS. have  
*tāriṣas*.⌋
