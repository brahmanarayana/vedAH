### Translation
6. Anumati hath become all this—what stands, moves, and all that stirs;  
may we be in the favor ⌊*sumatí⌋ of thee as such, O goddess; O Anumati,  
for mayest thou approve us.*

### Notes
Ppp. has, for **a**, *anumatir viśvam idaṁ jajāna;* ⌊in **b** (omitting  
*u* and *viśvam*), it reads *yad ejati carati yac ca tiṣṭhati*, thus  
rectifying the meter⌋.
