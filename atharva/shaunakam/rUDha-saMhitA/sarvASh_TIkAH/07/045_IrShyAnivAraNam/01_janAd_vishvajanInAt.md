### Translation
1. From a people belonging to all peoples, away from the river  
(*síndhu*) brought hither, from afar I think thee brought up, a remedy,  
namely, of jealousy.

### Notes
Very probably (**b**) rather 'from the Indus' (*síndhu*). Ppp. reads  
*-janīnaṁ viśam arukṣatīnām* (= *urukṣit-*?); its second half-verse is  
corrupt. The comm. explains *janāt* by *janapadāt* and its epithet by  
*viśvajanahitāt*.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
    
2 (47. 1). Of him as of a burning fire, of a conflagration burning  
separately, this jealousy of this man do thou appease, as fire with  
water.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
*Asya* in **a** is here regarded as anticipatory of the *etásya* of  
**c**; it cannot be taken as adjective unless by emendation we give it  
an accent. Again (cf. 18. 1 above) all the mss. read, in **d**, *unnā́,  
untā́, utnā́,* or *uttā́* instead of the correct *udnā́*, which the comm.  
has, and which is given, by emendation, in both printed texts. Ppp. has  
a very different text: *tat saṁvegasya bheṣajaṁ tad asunāmaṁ  
gṛbhāhitam:* and then, as second half-verse, our **a, b**, with *yathā*  
instead of *pṛthak;* in an added verse occurs the phrase *udhnā ’gnim  
iva vāraye*. ⌊"Do I appease," *śamaye*, would be more natural; cf. Ppp's  
*vāraye*.⌋
