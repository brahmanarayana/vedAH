### Translation
1. \[He\] whose \[established\] course all the cattle go, in whose  
course stand the waters, in whose course the lord of prosperity is  
entered—him, Sarasvant, we call to aid.

### Notes
The verse is found in several other texts: TS. (iii. 1. 11³), MS. (iv.  
10. 1), AśS. (iii. 8. 1), śśS. (vi. 11. 8); and it is a supplement  
(Aufrecht,² p. 678) to RV. vii. 96. All these agree in reading *vratám*  
in **b**, *puṣṭipátis* (the comm. also has this) in **c**, and *huvema*  
at the end. Ppp. has *vrate* in **a** and *vratam* in **b**, and  
*juhuvema* at the end.

We call Sarasvan, under whose protection all cattle wander, to preserve and aid us, Him in whose ordinance abide the waters, to whose command the Lord of Plenty listens.
