### Translation
6. This \[is\] thy sacrifice, O lord of sacrifice, accompanied with  
song-utterance, of excellent heroism: hail!

### Notes
⌊Prose.⌋ Again the A V. mss. add a punctuation-mark before *suvī́ryaḥ*,\*  
omitted in our text, but given by SPP.; the other texts (VS. viii. 22 b;  
TS.MS. as above) do not have it. TS. differs only by reading *suvī́raḥ;*  
MS. does the same and omits *svā́ha* (adding instead *téna sám bhava  
bhrā́jaṁ gacha*); VS. ends with *sárvavīras táj juṣasva svā́ha*. Ppp. has  
a yet more different version: *eṣa te yajño yajamānas svāhā  
sūktanamovākas suvīrās svāhā*. \*⌊To avoid taking the word as an  
adjective, BR., s.v., would read with TS. *suvī́raḥ*.⌋

This is thy sacrifice with hole hymnal, Lord of the Rite, Svaha! and fraught with vigour.
