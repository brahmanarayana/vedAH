### Translation
3. Loosen up the uppermost fetter from us, O Varuṇa, \[loosen\] down the  
lowest, off the midmost; then may we, O Āditya, in thy sphere (*vratá*),  
be guiltless unto Aditi.

### Notes
The verse is RV. i. 24. 15, and found also as VS. xii. 12, and in TS.  
(i. 5. 11³ et al.), MS. (i. 2. 18 et al.), SV. i. 589 (Nāigeya appendix  
i. 4), and MB. (i. 7. 10). All agree in reading *áthā* at beginning of  
**c** instead of our *ádhā* (the comm. has *atha*), and SV. and MB.  
further put *vayam* after *vraté* in **c**, while SV. accents *anāgásas*  
in **d**. ⌊Knauer, Index to MGS., p. 148, cites many occurrences of the  
verse.⌋ ⌊Repeated below as xviii. 4. 69.⌋

Loosen the bonds, O Varuna, that hold us, loosen the bond. above, between, and under. So before Aditi may we be sinless under thy favouring auspices, Aditya!
