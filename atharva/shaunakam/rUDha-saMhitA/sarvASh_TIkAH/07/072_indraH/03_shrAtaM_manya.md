### Translation
3 (76. 1). Cooked I think \[it\] in the udder, cooked in the fire; well  
cooked I think \[it\], that newer rite (? *ṛtá*); of the curds of the  
midday libation drink thou, O thunderbolt-bearing Indra, much-doing,  
enjoying \[it\].

### Notes
RV. reads *súśrātam* in **b**, and *purukṛd* (vocative) in **d**. ⌊For  
**a**, cf. Aufrecht's *Rigveda*² i. p. xvii, preface.⌋

Dressed in the udder and on fire, I fancy; well dressed, I fancy, is this new oblation. Quaff thickened milk of noon's libation, Indra, well pleased, O Thunderer, famed for many an exploit!
