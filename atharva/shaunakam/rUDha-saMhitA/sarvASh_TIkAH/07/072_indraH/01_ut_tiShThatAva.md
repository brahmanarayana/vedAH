### Translation
1. Stand ye up; look down at Indra's seasonable portion; if cooked, do  
ye offer \[it\]: if uncooked, do ye wait (*mad*).

### Notes
RV. makes the construction in the second half-verse more distinct by  
reading *śrātás* and *áśrātas*, nominatives; the comm. regards our  
*śrātám* (= *pakvam*) and *áśrātam* as made neuter to qualify a *havis*  
understood; he explains *mamáttana* ⌊cf. BR. v. 471⌋ as = *pacata* or  
*taptaṁ kuruta* (referring to the expression *madantīs* applied to  
water), or, alternatively, as *indraṁ stutibhir madayata;* those  
addressed are the priests (*he ṛtvijaḥ*).

Rise up and look upon the share of Indra fixt by ritual use. Whether ye poured libation dressed or took delight in it un- cooked.
