### Translation
1. Striding away from what is of men, choosing the words (*vácas*) of  
the gods, turn thou unto guidances, together with all \[thy\]  
companions.}}

Ppp. reads *saha* for *vacas* in **b**, and, for **d**, *devo devānāṁ  
sakhyā juṣāṇaḥ*. The comm. paraphrases *praṇītīs* by  
*prakṛṣṭanayanādivedabrahmacaryaniyatīḥ*.
