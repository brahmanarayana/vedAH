### Translation
1. Aditi \[is\] heaven, Aditi atmosphere, Aditi mother, she father, she  
son; all the gods \[are\] Aditi, the five races (jána); Aditi \[is\]  
what is born, Aditi what is to be born.

### Notes
This verse is, without variation, RV. i. 89. 10 (also VS. xxv. 23; TA.  
i. 13. 2; MS. iv. 14. 4); only RV. (in F. M. Müller's editions: but  
probably by an error) divides the last word *jáni-tvam* in the  
*pada*-text, while AV., more correctly, leaves it undivided.
