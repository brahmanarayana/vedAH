4 (7. 2). Now, in the impulse of might (*vā́ja*), will we commemorate (?  
*karāmahe*) with utterance (*vácas*) the great mother, Aditi by name,  
whose lap is the broad atmosphere; may she confirm to us  
thrice-defending protection.


The first half-verse is found also in VS. (ix. 5 b), TS. (i. 7. 7¹), MS.  
(i. 11. 1), without variant; the second half-verse, common to them all,  
is totally different from ours. A whole series of VS. verses begin with  
*vājasya prasava-* (ix. 23-25 etc.): Weber (*Vājapeya*, p. 796 ff.)  
renders "Zeuger der Kraft." All the *pada*-mss. read in **c**  
*upá॰sthaḥ*, but SPP. strangely prefers to substitute *-sthe* on the  
authority of the comm. The comm. glosses *karāmahe* with *kurmahe*, but  
then explains it by *stumas;* the true text is perhaps *vácasā́ ”kar-*  
'would we gain' (Henry translates "puissions-nous la gagner"). TS. has  
**c** in iii. 3. 11⁴ **c**, and its *pada*-text reads *upá॰sthaḥ*. ⌊Ppp.  
has for **c** the **c** of VS. etc., and for **d** *sā no devī suhavā  
śarma yacchatu.*⌋
