### Translation
1 (57. 2). The paths which are thine, downward from the sky, by which  
thou didst send the all—by those, O Vasu, do thou set us in what is  
pleasant.

### Notes
The first two pādas nearly correspond to SV. i. 172 **a, b**: *yé te  
pánthā adhó divó yébhir vyàśvam āírayaḥ;* with the wholly different  
close *utá śroṣantu no bhúvaḥ*. The comm. (as also the Anukr.) regards  
the verse as addressed to Indra; 'O Vasu' may be 'O good one.' The  
construction seems so decidedly to call for a locative in **c** that  
*sumnayā́* (p. *sumna॰yā́*, by Prāt. iv. 30) is rendered as if it were for  
*-yāú*, from -*yú*; the comm. glosses it with *sumne sukhe*. The  
irregular verse (8 + 7: 10 = 25) is but ill defined by the Anukr.

Thy downward paths from heaven, whereby thou hast raised all the world to life, Give us in gracious love, good Lord!
