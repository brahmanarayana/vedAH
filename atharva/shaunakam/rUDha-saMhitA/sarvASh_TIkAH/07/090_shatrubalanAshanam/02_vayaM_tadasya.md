### Translation
2. We, by Indra's aid, will share among us this collected good of his; I  
relax the vigor (? *śibhrám*) of thy member (?) by Varuṇa's vow  
(*vratá*).

### Notes
In the first half-verse (see above), RV. reads *bhajemahi*. The  
translation of **c** is tentative only; *śibhrám* (our W. (*śībhram*) is  
possibly a corruption of *śībham;* for *bhrajás* (understood here as  
gen. of *bhráj*) compare iv. 4. 1. The comm. reads *śubhram*, and  
(doubtless merely on account of its apparent connection with root  
*bhraj*) explains *bhrajas* by *dīptam* (supplying *retas*). Ppp. reads  
(corruptly) *mlāpayāvi bhrati śukra*. The intrusion of *vayám* or of  
*vásu* in **a** turns the *anuṣṭubh* into a bad *bṛhatī;* but RV. has  
both.

May we with Indra's help divide the gathered treasure of the foe. I, by the law of Varuna, bring down thy pride and wantonness.
