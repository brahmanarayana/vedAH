### Translation
1. Hew on, after ancient fashion, as it were the knot of a creeper; harm  
the force of the barbarian (*dāsá*).

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
This verse and the first half of the next are the first five pādas (a  
refrain being added as .sixth) of RV. viii. 40. 6, with no variant in  
this verse. The two parts of the hymn, as divided after 2 **b**, do not  
appear to belong together. The tradition makes the hymn directed against  
one's wife's paramour; and the comm. regards this first verse as an  
appeal to Agni. Ppp. reads at end *jambhaya*.

Tear thou asunder, as of old, like tangles of a creeping plant. Demolish thou the Dasa's might.
