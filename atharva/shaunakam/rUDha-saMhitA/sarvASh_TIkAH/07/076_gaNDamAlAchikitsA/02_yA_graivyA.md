### Translation
2. The *apacíts* that are on the neck, likewise those that are along  
the sides, the *apacíts* that are on the perineum (? *vijā́man*),  
self-deciduous.

### Notes
In translating the obscure *vijā́man*, the comm. is followed; he says  
*viśeṣeṇa jāyate ‘patyam atre ’ti vijāmā guhyapradeśaḥ;* Ludwig renders  
it "knöchel." *Upapakṣyās* he paraphrases with *upapakṣe pakṣasamīpa  
upakakṣe bhavāḥ*.
