### Translation
1. Come, O Indra, with pleasant peacock-haired bays; let not any hold  
thee away, as snarers a bird; go over them as \[over\] a waste.

### Notes
The verse is RV. iii. 45. 1, found also as SV. i. 246 et al., VS. xx.  
53, TA. i. 12. 2. Our (and SPP's) reading *yāhí* in **b** agrees with  
all these, but is against our mss. and all but two of SPP's; they leave  
the word unaccented. RV.VS. in **c** have *ní*, which is plainly the  
better reading, instead of *ví;* SV. has the corruption *ní yemur ín  
ná*, and TA., yet worse, *nyémúr ín ná*. ⌊TA. has at the end, corruptly,  
*nidhanvéva tā́ṅ imi.*⌋

Come hither, Indra, with bay steeds, joyous, with tails like pea- cock plumes. Let none impede thy way as fowlers stay the bird: pass o'er them as o'er desert lands.
