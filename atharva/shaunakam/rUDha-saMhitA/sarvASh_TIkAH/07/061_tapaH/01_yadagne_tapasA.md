### Translation
1. In that, O Agni, penance with penance, we perform additional (?)  
penance, may we be dear to what is heard, long-lived, very wise.

### Notes
'What is heard' (*śrutá*), the inspired or revealed word. Nearly all the  
mss. (all ours save Bp.¹ M.) read *priyā́* instead of *priyā́ḥ* at  
beginning of **c**. Ppp. has for **b** *upa prekṣāmahe\* vayam*. The  
comm. gives several diverse guesses at the sense of the obscure first  
half-verse. ⌊The vs. recurs with variants at MGS. i. 1. 18.⌋ \*⌊R.  
suggests that *pṛkṣāmahe* (root *pṛc*) may be intended.⌋
