### Translation
2. O Agni, we perform penance, we perform additional penance—we, hearing  
things heard, long-lived, very wise.

### Notes
It is questionable whether *upa-tapya* in both these verses has not a  
more pregnant meaning ⌊as above: BR., simply, 'Kasteiung leiden'⌋: Henry  
takes it as equivalent to simple *tapya.*

Agni, we practise acts austere, we undergo austerity. So listening to Holy Lore may we grow wise and full of days.
