### Comment
The directions admit also of being understood as from west, north, south, and east. RV. (and TS.) reads várivas in d, and so does Ppp. (varivaṣ kṛṇotu).


The fourth anuvāka ends here; it has, according to our division, 13 hymns and 30 verses; the other division counts 14 hymns; the quoted Anukr. is to this effect: dvāu pañcarcāu saṁniviṣṭāu caturthe; and, for the hymns: caturthe trayodaśa sūktāḥ—thus sanctioning our division.
