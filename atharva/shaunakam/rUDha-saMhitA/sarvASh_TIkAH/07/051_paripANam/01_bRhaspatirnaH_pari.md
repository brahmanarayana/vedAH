### Translation
1. Let Brihaspati protect us round about from behind, also from above,  
from below, against the malignant one; let Indra from in front and from  
midway make wide space for us, a companion for companions.

### Notes
The directions admit also of being understood as from west, north,  
south, and east. RV. (and TS.) reads *várivas* in **d**, and so does  
Ppp. (*varivaṣ kṛṇotu*).  
  
The fourth *anuvāka* ends here; it has, according to our division, 13  
hymns and 30 verses; the other division counts 14 hymns; the quoted  
Anukr. is to this effect: *dvāu pañcarcāu saṁniviṣṭāu caturthe;* and,  
for the hymns: *caturthe trayodaśa sūktāḥ*—thus sanctioning our  
division.

Brihaspati protect us from the sinner, from rearward, from above, and from below us! May Indra from the front and from the centre, as friend to friends, vouchsafe us room and freedom.
