### Translation
2. What here the black bird hath stroked down with thy mouth, O  
perdition—let the householder's fire release me from that sin.

### Notes
Ppp. has instead: *yadi vā ’mṛkṣata kṛṣṇaśakunir mukhena nirṛte tava:  
agniṣ tat sarvaṁ śundhatu havyavān̄ ghṛtasúdanaḥ*, which is the same with  
ĀpśS. ix. 17. 4 (only this begins *yad apā ’mṛkṣac chakunir*, rectifying  
the meter, and has *-vāḍ* in **d**). The second half-verse is found  
without variant in AśS. ii. 7. 11. The comm. takes *amṛkṣat* from root  
*mṛś*, as the translation does; cf. TS. iii. 2. 6², *yát  
kṛṣṇaśakunáḥ...avamṛśét...yác chvā́ ’vamṛśét*. ⌊See the note of Henry or  
Griffith.⌋ Such a verse (8 + 11: 8 + 8) is elsewhere called by the  
Anukr. an *urobṛhatī*.

May Agni Garhapatya save and set me free from all this guilt. Which the black Raven with thy mouth, O Nirriti, hath wiped away.
