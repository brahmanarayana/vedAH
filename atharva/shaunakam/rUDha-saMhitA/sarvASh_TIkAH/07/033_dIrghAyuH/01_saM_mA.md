### Translation
1. Let the Maruts pour me together, together Pūshan, together  
Brihaspati, together let Agni here pour me with both progeny and wealth;  
long life-time let him make for me.

### Notes
'Pour together' (*sam-sic*), i.e. mingle, combine, unite; the expression  
probably chosen as accompanying an action of mixing things together by  
pouring. In their corresponding verses, TA. (ii. 18⁴), JB. (i. 362),  
ĀpśS.(xiv. 18. l), and PGS. (iii. 12. 10) have *índras* instead of  
*pūṣā́* in **b**; ĀpśS. has *vas* instead of *mā* in **a** and **c**; in  
**d**, TA.JB.ĀpśS. have *ā́yuṣā* for *prajáyā*, and TA.JB. *bálena* for  
*dhánena;* **e** is wanting in PGS.; ĀpśS. has *sarvam* and *dadhātu*,  
TA. *ā́yuṣmantaṁ karota mā*. The variants of K. (xxxv. 2) are not  
accessible.

Let Pushan, let the Maruts, let Brihaspati pour forth on me; This present Agni pour on me children and riches in a stream! May he bestow long life on me.
