### Translation
1. Come ye together all with address (*vácas*) to the lord of the sky;  
\[he is\] the one mighty (*vibhū́*) guest of people; may he, ancient,  
conciliate the present one; him, being one, the track hath much turned  
after.

### Notes
The verse is here literally rendered according to the AV. version, but  
comparison with SV. and Ppp. shows plainly that its readings are very  
corrupt. SV. reads, in **a**, *s. víśvā ójasā;* it has at beginning of  
**b** *yá éka íd bhū́r;* in **c**, *ājígīṣam;* in **d**, *vartanī́r*, and  
*éka* it at the end (omitting *purú*). Ppp's version is this: **a, b**,  
*sam āitu viśvā oham ā pati divo eṣa ita bhūr aditir janānām;* in **d**,  
*vivṛte ’kam it paruḥ*. ⌊Henry suggests some emendations.⌋ The meter (12  
+ 10: 11 + 14 = 47) is not accurately defined by the Anukr.

With prayer come all together to the Lord of Heaven: he is the peerless one, far-reaching, guest of men. He, God of ancient time, hath gained a recent thrall; to him alone is turned the path which all must tread.
