### Translation
1. If (*yát*) in forgetfulness we have done aught, O Agni, have  
offended, O Jātavedas, in our behavior (*cáraṇa*), from that do thou  
protect us, O forethoughtful one; unto beauty be there immortality for  
us \[thy\] companions.

### Notes
The sense of the last pāda is obscure and doubtful. The comm. takes  
*śubhé* as loc. = *śobhane sān̄ge karmaṇi*. Ppp. reads *tasmāt* for  
*tatas* in **c**, and *śukhe* in **d**. The second half-verse is more  
irregular than the Anukr. admits.

Each thoughtless ill that we have done, O Agni, all error in our conduct, Jatavedas! Therefrom do thou, O sapient God, preserve us. May we thy friends, for bliss, have life eternal.
