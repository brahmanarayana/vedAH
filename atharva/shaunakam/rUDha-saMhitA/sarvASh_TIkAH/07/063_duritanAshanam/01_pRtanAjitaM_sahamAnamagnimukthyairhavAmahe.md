### Translation
1. The fight-conquering, overpowering Agni do we call with songs from  
the highest station; may he pass us across all difficult things; may  
divine Agni stride (?) across arduous things.

### Notes
The translation implies emendation of *kṣā́mat* to *krā́mat* in **d**, as  
suggested by BR. (and adopted also by Henry), since the former seems to  
give no good sense, and both form and composition with *ati* are  
elsewhere unknown for root *kṣam:* cf. also xii. 2. 28 **c**. But the  
parallel verse TA. x. 1. (68) has *kṣāmat* ⌊so both ed's, text and  
comm.⌋ and Ppp. reads *kṣāmād devo ‘dhi*. Our comm. explains *ati  
kṣāmat* as = *atyarthaṁ kṣāmāṇi dagdhāni karotu!* TA. further gives  
*ugrám agním* for *agnim ukthāis*, rectifies the meter of **b** by  
reading *huvema*, leaves the combination *devó áti* in **d**, and has  
*duritā́ ’ty* for *-tāni*. Our **c** is the same with RV. i. 99. 1 **c**.  
The verse has no *jagatī* character at all.

We call with lauds from his most lofty dwelling victorious Agni, conqueror in battles. May he conveyus over all distresses, may the God Agni bear us past our troubles.
