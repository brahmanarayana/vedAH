### Translation
2. May we be harmonious with mind, with knowledge (*cikitú*); may we not  
fight (?) with the mind of the gods; let not noises arise in case of  
much destruction (?); let not Indra's arrow fall, the day being come.

### Notes
Or (as the other translators), 'let not the arrow fly, Indra's day being  
come'; the comm. understands 'Indra's arrow,' i.e. the thunderbolt.\*  
The comm., in **c**, reads *vinihrute* (= *kāuṭilye nimitte* or  
*stāinyādikāuṭilyanimitte*). *Yutsmahi* in **b** is doubtful; SPP. reads  
*yuṣmahi*, with the comm. (= *viyuktā bhūma*) and the minority of his  
mss. (also our K.Kp.); the rest have either *yutsmahi* or *yuchmahi*  
(the latter also our O.s.m.D.R.s.m., which seems to be only an  
awkwardness of the scribes for *yutsmahi*); on the whole, *yutsmahi* is  
better supported, and either gives an acceptable sense. SPP. strangely  
reads, with the comm. and the majority of his authorities, and with part  
of ours (P.?O.R.), *út sthur* in **c**, against both general grammar and  
the Prātiśākhya (ii. 18; its commentary quotes this passage as an  
illustration of the rule). With **a** Grill compares RV. x. 30. 6 **c**,  
*sáṁ jānate mánasā sáṁ cikitre*. Pāda **b** is *triṣṭubh*, if not **a**  
also: ⌊is the second *sám* an intrusion?⌋. \*⌊Alternatively, and as  
*aśanirūpā parakīyā vāk.*⌋

May we agree in mind, agree in purpose: let us not fight against the heavenly spirit. Around us rise no din of frequent slaughter, nor Indra's arrow fly, for day is present!
