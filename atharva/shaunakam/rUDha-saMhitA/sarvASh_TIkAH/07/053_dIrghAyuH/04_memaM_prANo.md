### Translation
4. Let not breath leave this man; let not expiration, leaving him low,  
go away; I commit him to the seven sages (*ṛ́ṣi*); let them carry him  
happily (*svastí*) unto old age.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Ppp. fills out the meter of **a** by reading *mā tvā prāṇo hāsīd yas te  
praviṣṭo*, and begins its **b** thus: *mā tvā ’pāno ‘v-*; in **c** and  
**d** (its 2 **c, d**) it has *dadhvahe* and *nayantu*. Part of the mss.  
accent *apānó ‘va-* in **b**. SPP. reads, with the small majority of his  
mss., *saptarṣíbhya* in **c** (against our *saptaṛṣ-*); our mss. vary,  
as usual. With **a, b** compare the nearly equivalent xvi. 4. 3 **a,  
b**. The Anukr. apparently scans the first line as 7 + 11, but the  
*pada*-mss. mark the division after *apānas* (as 11 + 7). Henry fills  
the meter conjecturally by adding *mó vyānó*.

Let not the vital breath he draws forsake him, let not his expiration part and leave him. I give him over to the Seven Rishis: let them conduct him to old age in safety.
