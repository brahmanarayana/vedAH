### Translation
7. Up out of darkness have we, ascending the highest firmament, gone to  
the sun, god among the gods, highest light.

### Notes
This verse (with a different second pāda, *jyótiṣ páśyanta üttaram*,  
which Ppp. also gives) is RV. i. 50. 10, and found also in a whole  
series of other texts: VS. xx. 21 et al. (with *svàḥ* for *jyótiṣ* in  
**b**), TS. iv. 1. 7⁴ (with *páśyanto jyótir* in **b**), TB. ii. 4. 4⁹\*  
(as TS.), TA. vi. 3. 2 (as TS.), MS. ii. 12. 5 et al. (with *jyótiḥ p-*  
in **b**), LśS. ii. 12. 10 (with *jyotiḥ p. u. svaḥ p. n.* for **b**),  
ChU. iii. 17. 7 (as MS., but *jyotiṣ p-*).† It is used by Kāuś. (24. 32)  
in the *āgrahāyaṇī* ceremony, with the direction *ity utkrāmati* 'with  
this he steps upward'; and the schol. adds it (note to 55. 15) in the  
ceremony of initiation of a Vedic scholar, as one looks at the sun and  
asks his protection for the boy; and further (note to 58. 18), in the  
*nirṇayana*, or infant's first carrying out of doors. In Vāit. (24. 4)  
it accompanies the coming out of the bath in the *agniṣṭoma*. \*⌊And ii.  
6. 6⁴: the **d** of ii. 4. 4⁹ has *uttaram*.⌋ †⌊Also K. xxxviii. 5.⌋
