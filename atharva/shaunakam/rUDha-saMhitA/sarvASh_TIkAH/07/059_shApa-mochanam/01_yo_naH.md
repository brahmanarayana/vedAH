### Translation
1. Whoever shall curse us not cursing, and whoever shall curse us  
cursing, like a tree smitten by a thunderbolt, let him dry up from the  
root.

### Notes
The first half-verse is vi. 37. 3 **a, b**, and is found in other  
texts\* as there referred to. Ppp. has the whole verse as our vi. 37. 3,  
and it combines in **c**, as often, *vṛkṣāi ’va*. The Anukr. seems to  
ratify the contraction *vṛkṣe ’va*. \*⌊See also *Kaṭha-hss.* p. 74.⌋  
  
The fifth *anuvāka* ends here; it has 8 hymns and 25 verses; the Anukr.  
quotation for the verses is *pañcai ’vo ”rdhvaṁ viṅśateḥ pañcame syuḥ*,  
and, for the hymns, *pañcamo ‘ṣṭāu*.  
  
Here ends also the sixteenth *prapāṭhaka*.

Like a tree struck by lightning may the man be withered from the root. Who curseth us who curse not him, or, when we curse him. curseth us.
