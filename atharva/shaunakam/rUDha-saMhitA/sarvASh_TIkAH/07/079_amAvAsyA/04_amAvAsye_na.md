### Translation
4. O Amāvāsyā, no other than thou, encompassing, gave birth to all these  
forms; what desiring we make libation to thee, be that ours; may we be  
lords of wealth.

### Notes
This is, with alteration of the first word only, a repetition in advance  
of 80. 3. For the parallels etc., see under that verse.

Night of New Moon! ne'er hath been born another than thou embracing all these forms and natures, May we have what we longed for when we brought thee obla- tions: may we be the lords of riches.
