### Translation
1. What portion (*bhāgadhéya*) the gods made for thee, O Amāvāsyā,  
dwelling together with might, therewith fill our offering, O thou of all  
choice things; assign to us, O fortunate one, wealth rich in heroes.

### Notes
The verse occurs in TS. (iii. 5. 1¹), with *ádadhus* for *ákṛṇvan* in  
**a**, and ⌊rectifying the meter⌋ *sā́* for *ténā* in **c**. Ppp.  
combines *devā ’kṛṇvan* in **a**, and has *saṁvadantas* in **b**, and  
*sa imaṁ y-* at beginning of **c**. *Saṁ-vas* plays upon the equivalent  
*amā-vas*, which gives name to the day and its goddess. The verse has no  
*jagatī* character. ⌊We had the second half-verse above at 20. 4 **c,  
d**.⌋
