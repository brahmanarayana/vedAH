### Translation
3. The night hath come, assembler of good things, causing sustenance,  
prosperity, \[and\] good to enter in; we would worship Amāvāsyā with  
oblation; yielding (*duh*) sustenance with milk is she come to us.

### Notes
TS. has (iii. 5. 1¹) a verse quite accordant with this in general  
meaning, but too different in detail to be called the same; it reads  
*nivéśanī saṁgámanī vásūnāṁ víśvā rūpā́ṇi vásūny āveśáyantī: sahasrapoṣáṁ  
subhágā rárāṇā sā́ na ā́ ’gan várcasā saṁvidānā́*. Ppp. reads, in **b**,  
*viśvaṁ* for *ū́rjam;* and, in **d**, *vasānā* (for *duhānā*) and *nā  
’gaṁ*.  
  
The comm., and some of the mss., end the hymn here, carrying over our  
vs. 4 to the following hymn; our division agrees with the sense, the  
Anukr., and other of the mss.; and SPP. accepts the same. ⌊The decad  
ends here: cf. p. 389.⌋

The Night hath come, the gatherer of treasures, bestowing strength, prosperity, and riches. To New Moon's Night let us present oblation: pouring out strength, with milk hath she come hither.
