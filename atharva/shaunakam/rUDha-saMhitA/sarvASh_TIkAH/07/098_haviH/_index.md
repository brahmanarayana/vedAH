### Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xx. In Kāuś. (6. 7), the verse accompanies, at the parvan sacrifice, the distribution of barhis to each divinity; and again (88. 6), in the piṇḍapitṛyajña, the sprinkling of rice-grains joined with darbha. In Vāit. (4.6), it goes with the casting of the prastara into the fire in the parvan sacrifice.
