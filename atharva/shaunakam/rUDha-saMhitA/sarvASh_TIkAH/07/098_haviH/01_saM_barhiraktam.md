### Translation
1. The *barhis* is all (*sám*) anointed with oblation, with ghee, all by  
the good Indra, all by the Maruts; \[it is\] all anointed by the gods,  
by the all-gods; let the oblation go to Indra: hail!

### Notes
A corresponding but quite different verse is found as VS. ii. 22  
(immediately following a repetition of the VS. version of our 97. 7, 8):  
it reads *an̄ktām* instead of *aktám* in **a** and **c**, has *ādityāír  
vásubhis* for *índreṇa vásunā* in **b**, *índras* for *devāís* in **c**,  
and, for **d**, *divyáṁ nábho gachatu yát svā́hā*. Ppp. also has (better)  
*vasubhis* for *vasunā* in **b**, and *devebhis* in **c**, rectifying  
its meter. The comm. reads *barhis* for *havis* in **d**. The verse  
lacks three syllables in its second half.
