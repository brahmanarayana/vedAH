### Translation
1. O Agni, shine thou here unassailable, Jātavedas, immortal,  
wide-ruling (*virā́j*), bearing dominion; releasing all diseases by  
humane, propitious \[aids\], do thou protect round about today our  
household.

### Notes
The comm. supplies *ūtibhis* in **c, d**, and the translation given  
follows his lead. The verse is found also as VS. xxvii. 7, and in TS.  
iv. i. 7³ and MS. ii. 12. 5; MS. makes **c** easy by reading *mā́nuṣāṇām*  
(it also has *ví* for *víśvās*), and VS.TS. by reading *mā́nuṣīr bhiyáḥ*.  
MS.VS. give after this *śivébhis;* and VS.TS. have *ā́śās* for *ámīvās*  
in **c**. All read *ániṣṭṛtas* (Ppp. *aniṣṭatas*) for *ámartyas* in  
**a**, and *vṛdhé* for *gáyam* at the end (Ppp. *gayāiḥ*). Ppp. has, in  
**c, d**, *manuṣyebhyaḥ śivebhir*. All the texts thus relieve in various  
ways the difficulties and awkwardnesses of the second half-verse.  
  
We should expect here a separation of the hymn into two, as the  
remaining verses are addressed to Indra; but no ms. or other authority  
so divides.
