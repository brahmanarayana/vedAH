### Translation
2. O Indra, unto dominion, \[unto\] pleasant force, wast thou born, thou  
bull of men (*carṣaṇí*); thou didst push away the inimical people; thou  
didst make wide room for the gods.

### Notes
This verse and the next are two verses, connected (but in inverted  
order), in RV. (x. 180. 3, 2), found also in TS. i. 6. 12⁴. Both these  
read in **c** *amitrayántam*, their only variant in this verse. In **d**  
*carṣaṇīnā́m* is most naturally made dependent on *vṛṣabha*, although, as  
such, it ought to be without accent; Henry takes it as governed by the  
nouns in **a**. The verse (doubtless with vs. 3) is used by Kāuś. (17.  
31) in the consecration of a king ⌊Weber, *Rājasūya*, p. 142⌋, and (140.  
17) in the *indramahotsava*, with libation to Indra, and service of  
Brahmans. ⌊RV.TS. accent *carṣaṇinā́m* and all of W's and SPP's mss. seem  
to do so. Perhaps, in spite of W's version, we have no right to correct  
our text by deleting the accent; but the accent can hardly be aught else  
than an old blunder.⌋

Thou, Indra, lord and leader of the people, wast born for lovely strength and high dominion. Thou dravest off the folk who were unfriendly, and madest for the Gods wide room and freedom.
