### Translation
2. In whose (sing.) direction is whatever shines out here, \[whatever\]  
both breathes forth and looks abroad mightily (*śácībhis*), of old, by  
the god's ordinance, with powers (*sáhas*)—to Vishṇu, to Varuṇa hath  
gone the first invocation.

### Notes
The first pāda is found above as iv. 23. 7 **a**, and nearly as iv. 28.  
1 **b**; also in TS. iii. 3. 11⁴. Ppp. reads, for **c**, *maho\* ṛtasya  
dharmaṇā yuvānā*, and begins with *yayos*. The comm., in **b**, seems to  
give *prā ’niti ca*. The first pāda is rather *jagatī*. \*⌊So Roth's  
collation: his notes give *mahā*.⌋

The early prayer hath ever come to Vishnu and Varuna by that God's high power and statute. In whose control is all this world that shineth, all that hath powers to see and all that breatheth.
