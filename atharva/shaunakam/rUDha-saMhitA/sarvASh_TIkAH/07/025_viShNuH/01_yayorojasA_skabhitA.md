### Translation
1. By whose ⌊du.⌋ force were established the spaces (*rájas*), who by  
heroisms are most heroic, most mighty, who by their powers lord it  
unopposed—to Vishṇu, to Varuṇa hath gone the first invocation.

### Notes
The verse is found also in a number of other texts: VS. (viii. 59), TB.  
(ii. 8. 4⁵), MS. (iv. 14. 6), SB. (i. 5), AśS. (v. 20. 6), śśS. (iii.  
20. 4); all of them agree nearly in their variations from our text:  
thus, *vīryèbhir* (but MS. *vīrébhir*) for *yāú vīryāìr* in **b**; *yā́*  
and *ápratītā* (but TB. *-tīttā*) in **c**; and *víṣṇū*, *váruṇā*, and  
*pūrváhūtāu* (but MS. *-tim*) in **d**; TB. further *śáciṣṭhā* in **b**.  
Ppp. has *stabhitā* in **a**, and *śacībhiḥ* (for *śaviṣṭhā*) in **b**.

The early morning prayer hath come to Vishnu and Varuna, Lords through might, whom none hath equalled, Gods by whose power the realms of air were stablished, strongest and most heroic in their vigour.
