### Translation
1. Unto this god Savitar, of poets' skill (*-krátu*), of true impulse,  
treasure-bestowing, unto the dear one, I, in the two *oṇí*'s, sing  
(*arc*) \[my\] prayer.

### Notes
VS.śśS.ACS. add at the end *kavím*, and MS. has *satyásavasam* (for  
*-savam*). Two or three of the mss. (including our O.) read  
*satyásavām*, as if agreeing with *matím*. The comm. explains *oṇyòs* as  
'heaven and earth, the two favorers (*avitṛ*) of everything,' and makes  
*matí* at the end masc, = *sarvāir mantavyam*. The construction of the  
verse is intricate and doubtful. The metrical definition by the Anukr.  
of the first two verses as *anuṣṭubh* is bad; they are really four  
*jagatī* pādas, to each of which are added four syllables that encumber  
the sense. ⌊From a critical point of view, these additions seem to me  
comparable with those in ii. 5; see introduction to ii. 5.⌋
