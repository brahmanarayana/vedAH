### Translation
4. May the household god, the desirable Savitar, assign to the Fathers  
treasure, dexterity, life-times; may he drink the soma; may \[it\]  
exhilarate him at the sacrifice; any wanderer walks (*kram*) in his  
ordinance.

### Notes
Ppp. differs only by combining *pitṛbhyā ’yūṅṣi* in **b**; but AśS. (v.  
18. 2) and śśS. (viii. 3. 4: AB. iii. 29. 4 quotes the *pratīka* only)  
have important and in part preferable variants, especially in the  
second line, where they read *amadann enam iṣṭayaḥ*, and *ramate* for  
*kramate*. In **b**, both give *dakṣa* and *āyuni*, and AśS. *ratnā*.  
⌊The verse has one *triṣṭubh* pāda (**c**); and **b** is a very poor  
*jagatī.*⌋

Savitar, God, our household friend, most precious, hath sent our fathers life and power and riches. Let him drink Soma and rejoice when worshipped. Under his law even the Wanderer travels.
