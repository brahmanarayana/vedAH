### Translation
1. What has gone wrong (*vi-kṣubh*) on the part of me speaking with  
expectation, what of \[me\] going about among people begging, what in  
myself of my body is torn apart—that may Sarasvatī fill up with ghee.

### Notes
Ppp. arranges differently the matter in **a, b**: *yad aśasā me carato  
janāṅ anu yad yācamānasya vadato vicukṣubhe;* and it has a different  
**c**: *yan me tanvo rajasi praviṣṭam;* further, it reads *pṛṇād* in  
**d**. The authorities are divided between *tád* and *yád* at beginning  
of **c**; our Bp.W.I.O.s.m.T.K. and the comm. have *tád;* both editions  
give *yád*. Some of our mss. (Bp.E.D.O.p.m.) have *sárasvati* in **d**,  
and one (E.) has correspondingly *pṛṇa*. Both verses are irregular  
*jagatī*.

Whatever trouble hath disturbed and shaken me--I speak with hope, I move, imploring, 'mid the folk What harm my body in myself hath suffered, now let Sarasvati relieve with fatness.
