### Translation
2. Seven flow for the Marut-accompanied young one (*śíśu*); for the  
father the sons have made to understand righteous things; both indeed  
bear rule over this of both kinds; both strive, both prosper (*puṣ*) of  
it.

### Notes
The verse is RV. x. 13. 5; but RV. reads *ṛtám* at end of **b**, and  
twice (in **c, d**) *ubháyasya* for *ubhé asya*. The translation follows  
the RV. reading in **c**. "Both," it is to be noticed (in **c, d**), is  
neuter (or fem.), not masculine. The sense is intended to be mystic, and  
is very obscure. SPP. reads in **b**, with all his authorities (at  
least, he reports nothing to the contrary), and with the comm.,  
*avīvṛtann* (the comm. glosses it with *vartayanti anutiṣṭhanti*); the  
same is given by our M.W.I. Ppp. has a text that is partly different and  
partly corrupt: *sapta sravanti śiśavo marutvate pitā pitrebhyo apy  
avīvat padvataḥ: ubhaye piprati ubhaye ‘sya rājahi ubhe ubhe ubhaye ‘sya  
piṣyakaḥ*.

Seven flow for him, the youth on whom the Maruts wait: the sons have taught the Father everlasting laws. Both worlds are his: both shine belonging unto him. Both move together: both, as his possession thrive.
