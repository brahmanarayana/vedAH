### Translation
4. May we, with thee as ally, conquer the troop (? *vṛt*) do thou help  
upward our side in every conflict; for us, O Indra, make thou wide  
space, easy-going; do thou break up the virilities of our foes, O  
bounteous one.

### Notes
The verse is RV. i. 102. 4, where *várivas* is read in **c** instead of  
*várīyas*. The comm. explains *vṛt* as antagonist at play, *aṅśa* as  
victory (*jayalakṣaṇa*), and *bhara* as the contest with dice.

With thee to aid us may we win the treasure: do thou assist our side in every battle. Give us wide room and easy way, O Indra; break down, O Maghavan, the foemen's valour.
