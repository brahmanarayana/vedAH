### Translation
2. Of the quick, of the slow, of the people that cannot avoid it (?),  
let the fortune come together from all sides, my winnings in hand.

### Notes
That is, apparently, so as to be won by me. The meaning of *dvarjuṣīṇām*  
in **b** is extremely problematical; the translators: "wehrlos" etc.  
Comparison with *viśā́ṁ vavarjúṣīṇām*, RV. i. 134. 6, and the  
irregularity of the unreduplicated form, make the reading very  
suspicious; Ppp. gives instead *devayatīm;* the comm. explains it  
⌊alternatively⌋ as *dyūtakriyām aparityajantīnām*, sticking to the game  
in spite of ill luck. For **d**, Ppp. has *antarhastyaṁ kṛtaṁ manaḥ*.

From every side, from hale and sick, impotent to defend them- selves, May all the fortune of the folk as winnings pass into my hands.
