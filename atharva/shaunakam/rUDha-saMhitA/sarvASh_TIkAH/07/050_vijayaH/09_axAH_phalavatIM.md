### Translation
9. O ye dice, give \[me\] fruitful play, like a milking cow; fasten me  
together with a stream (?) of winnings, as a bow with sinew.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *divam* for *dyuvam* in **a**, and *dhāraya* in **c**.  
*Dhārā*, in whatever sense taken, makes a very unacceptable comparison;  
the comm. paraphrases it with *saṁtatyā  
uparyuparilābhahetuk¿rtāyapravāheṇa*. ⌊His interpretation seems to mean  
'Unite me with a succession (*saṁtati* or *pravāha*) of fours'  
(*kṛta-aya*), or, as we should say, 'Give me a run (*dhārā* or  
*pravāha*) of double sixes,' 'Give me a run of luck.'⌋
