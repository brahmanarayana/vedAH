### Translation
5. Three steps Vishnu strode out, the unharmable shepherd, ordaining  
(*dhṛ*) here (*itás*) \[his\] ordinances.

### Notes
RV.SV. read *átas* at beginning of **c**, and VS. (xxxiv. 43) agrees  
with them; TB. (ii. 4. 6¹) has instead *tátas*. It seems hardly possible  
to give *itás* its distinctive meaning 'from here'; but Henry combines  
it with *ví cakrame:* "from here." The comm. has *atas*.
