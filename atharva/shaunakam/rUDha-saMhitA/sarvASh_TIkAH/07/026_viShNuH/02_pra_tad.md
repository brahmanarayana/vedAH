### Translation
2. So Vishnu praises forth his heroisms, like a fearful wild beast,  
wandering, mountain-staying,—

### Notes
From distant distance may he come hither.—  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
The first two pādas of this verse, with the first two of our vs. 3, form  
one verse in the other texts: RV. i. 154. 2; TB. ii. 4. 3⁴; MS. i. 2. 9;  
Āp. xi. 9. 1; and also in Ppp., which has it alone, besides our vs. 1.  
RV.MS. read *vīryèṇa*, which is better, in **a**; TB.Āp. *vīryàya*  
instead. Our second pāda forms, together with our (intruded) third pāda,  
a first half-verse in several other texts: RV. x. 180. 2; SV. ii. 1223;  
VS. xviii. 71; TS. i. 6. 12⁴; MS. iv. 12. 3; instead of *jagamyāt* is  
read *jaganthā* by all except TS., which has *jagāmā;* the whole (RV.  
etc.) verse is our vii. 84. 3 below. The comm. unites to this verse the  
first two pādas of the one following, which certainly belong much more  
properly with it; but the mss. and the Anukr. require the division as  
made in our text; and SPP. also follows them.

Loud boast doth Vishnu make of this achievement, like some wild beast, dread, prowling, mountain-roaming. May he approach us from the farthest distance.
