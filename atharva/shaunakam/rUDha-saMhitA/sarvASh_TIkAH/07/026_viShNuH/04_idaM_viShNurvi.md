### Translation
4. Here Vishṇu strode out; thrice he set down his steps; \[it is\]  
collected in his dust.

### Notes
This and the three following verses form one connected passage also in  
RV. (i. 22. 17-20) and SV. (ii. 1019-22), but not in the other texts in  
which they are, in part or all, found. In this verse, RV.SV. read  
*padám* at end of **b**,\* and SV. has *pāṅsule* at end of **c**. Of the  
other texts, VS. (v. 15) and TS. (i. 2. 13¹) agree with RV.; MS. (i. 2.  
9 et al.) has *padā́*, like our text. The meaning of **c** is obscure and  
disputed: the comm. here explains thus: *viṣṇoḥ...pāṅsumati pāde  
lokatrayam...samavasthāpitaṁ samākṛṣṭaṁ vā*. Henry renders "for him it  
is reduced to a dust-heap." \*⌊SV. also at i. 222.⌋
