### Translation
1. Of Vishnu now I would speak forth the heroisms, who traversed  
(*vi-mā*) the spaces of the earth, who established the upper station,  
striding out triply, he the wide-going one.

### Notes
The verse is RV. i. 154. 1 (also VS. v. 18; TS. i. 2. 13³; MS. i. 2. 9,  
all precisely like RV.), which reads at end of **a**, in different  
order, *vīryā̀ṇi prá vocam*. *Prá* in our text is a misprint for *prá*,  
which all our *saṁhitā*-mss. give. ⌊The vs. seems to be suggested by RV.  
i. 32. 1.⌋

I will declare the mighty deeds of Vishnu, of him who measured out the earthly regions, Who propped the highest place of congregation, thrice setting down his footstep, widely striding.
