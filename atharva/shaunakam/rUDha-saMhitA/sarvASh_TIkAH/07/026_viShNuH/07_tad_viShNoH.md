### Translation
7. That highest step of Vishṇu the patrons (*sūrí*) ever behold, like an  
eye stretched on the sky.

### Notes
In all the texts, this verse is given in connection with the preceding  
one. RV.SV., and also VS. (vi. 5), have precisely our text; TS. (i. 3.  
6² et al.) differs only by accenting, according to its usage, *divī́  
’va\*;* MS. (i. 2. 14) reads *śácyā* for *sádā* in **b**. \*⌊Gram. §128;  
Prāt. iii. 56.⌋
