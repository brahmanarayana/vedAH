### Translation
1. The goddess Kuhū, well-doing, working with knowledge, in this  
sacrifice I call upon with good call; may she confirm to us wealth  
having all choice things; let her give a hero of hundred-fold value,  
worthy of praise.

### Notes
All the other texts read *ahám* for *devī́m* in **a**, and for *sukṛ́tam*  
AśS.śśS. give *suvṛtam* and TS. *subhágām* (Ppp. has *amṛtam*); all, in  
**b**, have *suhávām*, which is better (so also the comm.). Their second  
half-verse is different from ours: *sā́ no dadātu śrávaṇam pitṝṇā́ṁ  
tásyāi\* te devi havíṣā vidhema;* and Ppp. gives the same, but with *ā*  
(for *sā*), *śrāvaṇaṁ*, and *ta* (for *te*). Our Bp. divides  
*vidmanā॰ápasam;* two of SPP's mss. give *-nā́॰áp-*. For *śatadāya*, see  
Roth in ZDMG. xli. 672; the comm. says *bahudhanam bahupradaṁ vā*. The  
meter is not full *jagatī*. \*⌊TS. *pitṛṇā́ṁ tásyās*.⌋
