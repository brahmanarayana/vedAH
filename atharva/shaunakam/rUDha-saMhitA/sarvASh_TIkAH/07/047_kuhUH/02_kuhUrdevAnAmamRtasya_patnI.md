### Translation
2. May Kuhū, spouse of the gods, \[mistress\] of the immortal,  
invocable, enjoy this our libation; let her listen eager to our  
sacrifice today; let her, knowing {*cikitúṣī*), assign abundance of  
wealth.

### Notes
*Asya*, in **b**, ought of course to be *asyá* (so TS.MS.), but this, so  
far as noted, is read by only a single ms. (our D.), and both printed  
texts give *asya*. At end of **a**, śśS. has *patnīr* (*h-*); at end of  
**b**, TS. has *ciketu*, MS.AśS. *śrṇotu*, and śśS. *kṛṇotu*. Instead of  
our **c**, all give *saṁ* (MS. *sá;* misprint?) *dāśúṣe kirátu bhū́ri  
vāmám;* and Ppp. has the same, save *kirate*, and *puṣṭā* (for *vāmam*).  
At the end, śśS. has *dadātu;* just before, TS.MS.śśS. read *cikitúṣe*  
and AśS. *yajamāne*. The comm. gives several diverse explanations of  
*amṛtasya patnī*.
