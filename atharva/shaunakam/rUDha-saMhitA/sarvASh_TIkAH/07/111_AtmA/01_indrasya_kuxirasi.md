### Translation
1. Indra's paunch art thou, soma-holding, soul of gods and of human  
beings; here do thou generate offspring that \[are\] thine in them (f.);  
let those that \[are\] elsewhere rest here for thee.

### Notes
Ppp. combines *-dhānā ”tmā*, and reads in **b** (after *devānām*) *asya  
viśvarūpaḥ*, and at the end *tās te svadhito gṛṇantu*. The comm. regards  
the verse as addressed either to a bull let loose (as quoted in Kāuś.  
24. 19) or to the *pūtabhṛt* soma-vessel (as quoted in Vāit. 17. 9). In  
**c**, *āsú* is obscure, and is perhaps to be emended to *āsús;* the  
comm. explains it as either = *purovartinīṣu goṣu* or *yajamānādirūpāsu  
vikṣu*. The verse is further reckoned ⌊note to Kāuś. 19. 1⌋ to the  
*puṣṭika mantras*. It is a pure *triṣṭubh*, without *bṛhatī* element;  
but is *pada*-mss. make the third pāda end with *yā́*. ⌊With **a**, cf.  
RV. iii. 36. 8 **a**.⌋

Belly of Indra art thou, Soma-holder! the very soul of Gods and human beings. Here be the sire of offspring, thine here present! Here be they glad in thee who now are elsewhere.
