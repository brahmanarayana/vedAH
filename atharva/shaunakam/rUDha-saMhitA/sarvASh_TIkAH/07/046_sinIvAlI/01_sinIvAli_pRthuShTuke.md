### Translation
1. O Sinīvālī, of the broad braids, that art sister of the gods! enjoy  
thou the offered oblation; appoint us progeny, O goddess.

### Notes
Some of the mss. (including our Bp.P.) wrongly leave *ási* unaccented in  
**b**. Most of our mss. read *didiḍhḍhi* in **d**, but SPP. reports  
nothing of the kind from his authorities; Ppp. gives *didiḍhi*. The  
verse is RV. ii. 32. 6 (also VS. xxxiv. 10; TS. iii. i. 11³; MS. iv. 12.  
6), without variant.\* The second half is nearly the same with 20. 2  
**c, d**; 68. 1 **c, d**. The comm. gives several discordant  
interpretations of *pṛthuṣṭuke*, and is uncertain whether to take  
*didiḍḍhi* from *diś* ⌊*Gram.* §218⌋ or from *dih*. \*⌊And **b** is  
nearly v. 5. 1 **d** and vi. 100. 3 **b**.⌋
