### Translation
2. By whom in the very beginning they won the heaven (*svàr*), who stood  
unto all existences, the two men-helpers (?), bulls,  
thunderbolt-armed—Agni, Indra, Vritra-slayers, do I invoke.

### Notes
Found also in TB. (ii. 4. 5⁷) and MS. (iv. 12. 6); TB. puts in **a**  
*súvar* before *ájayan*, much improving the meter; MS. does the same,  
but corrupts to *ájanan;* in **b**, TB. has *bhúvanasya mádhye;* in  
**c**, both accent *prá carṣaṇī́*, and TB. *vṛṣaṇā* (as voc.)\*; in  
**d**, MS. ends with *-háṇaṁ huvema*, while TB. has *agnī́ índrā  
vṛtraháṇā huve vām*. Ppp. has at the beginning *yābhyāṁ svar itayaty  
agre* (*eva* wanting), and *huvāma* at the end. The 'they' of **a**,  
according to the comm., are the gods. For *prácarṣaṇī* is given a  
conjectural rendering, though the word is doubtless a corruption; the  
Pet. Lex. had conjectured an emendation to *prá carṣaṇī* ⌊comparing RV.  
i. 109. 5⌋; the comm. gives it an alternative explanation: either  
*prakarṣeṇa draṣṭārāu*, or *prakṛṣṭā manuṣyā yayor yaṣṭṛtvena santi*.  
⌊As to *vṛtra-*, see note to vs. i.⌋ \*⌊And MS. reads *vájrabāhum*.⌋

Agni I call, and Indra, foe-destroyers, swift moving, heroes, Gods who wield the thunder, Through whom they won the light in the beginning, these who have made all worlds their habitation.
