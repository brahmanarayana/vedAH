### Translation
1. Well anointed for me have heaven-and-earth, well anointed hath Mitra  
here made \[it\]; well anointed for me may Brahmaṇaspati, well anointed  
may Savitar make \[it\].

### Notes
The comm. supplies *akṣiyugaṁ yūpaṁ vā* for *svāktam* to agree with. The  
meter is plainly *anuṣṭubh*.
