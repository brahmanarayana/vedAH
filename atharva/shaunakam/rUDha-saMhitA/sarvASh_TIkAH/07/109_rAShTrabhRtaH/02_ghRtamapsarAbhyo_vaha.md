### Translation
2. Do thou, O Agni, carry ghee for the Apsarases, dust for the dice,  
gravel and waters; enjoying in their respective shares the  
oblation-giving, the gods revel in both kinds of oblations.

### Notes
Ppp. puts *agne* after *ghṛtam* in **a** ⌊a great improvement of the  
meter⌋, reads *nakhebhyas* in **b**, makes **c** refer to Agni by giving  
*yathābhāgas* and *juṣāṇas*, and has *madantu* in **d**. Some of the  
mss. (including our D.K.) also read *madantu*, and it gives the  
preferable sense; but both editions have *-ti*, as being better  
supported. Half SPP's mss., and at least one (D.) of ours, give *pāṅśū́n*  
in **b**. The comm. boldly declares *akṣebhyas* in **b** to mean  
*pratikitavebhyas:* they are to have dust etc. flung at them, that they  
may be beaten.

Bear butter to the Apsarases, O Agni, and to the Dice bear dust and sand and water. The Gods delight in both oblations, joying in sacrificial gifts apportioned duly.
