### Translation
5. He who made this riches for our playing, who the taking (?) and  
leaving of the dice—that god, enjoying this libation of ours—may we  
revel a joint reveling with the Gandharvas.

### Notes
The Ppp. version is quite different: *yo no devo dhanam idaṁ dideśa yo  
‘kṣāṇāṁ grahaṇaṁ śaṣaṇaṁ ca: sa no ’vatu havir* etc.; also *gandharvāis  
sadh-* in **d**. The comm. explains *gláhanam* and *śéṣaṇam*  
respectively by *grahaṇa¿m svakīyāir akṣāir jitvā svīkaraṇam*, and  
*svīyānām akṣāṇāṁ jayāhvasthāne* (one ms. *-yāṅhva-*) ‘*vaśeṣaṇam*.

The God who found for us this wealth for gambling, to cast the dice and count the winning number, May he accept the sacrifice we offer, and with Gandharvas revel in the banquet.
