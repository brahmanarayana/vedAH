### Translation
6. Having good things in common (? *sáṁvasu*)—that is your appellation;  
for stern-looking, realm-bearing \[are\] the dice; you as such, O drops,  
would we worship with oblation; may we be lords of wealth.

### Notes
Ppp. begins **c** with *tasmāi ta indro hav-*. Emendation in **b** to  
*akṣāḥ* (voc.) would be a welcome improvement; Henry so translates. The  
minor Pet. Lex. conjectures that *indavas* in **c** means 'the marks or  
pips on the dice': perhaps rather applied figuratively to the dice  
themselves\*; the comm. renders by *somavantaḥ  
somopalakṣitahaviryuktāḥ*,† as adj. qualifying *vayam*. The comm. is  
uncertain whether the Gandharvas or the dice are addressed in **a**; in  
**b** he understands the two epithets to be gen. sing., *ugrampaśyā*  
being for *-śyāyās!* and he refers to and quotes TA. ii. 4. 1, where  
they are found as singular, instead of our own text vi. 118. 2. The  
third pāda is *jagatī* ⌊only by count⌋. \*⌊The major Lex. takes it as  
'dice.'—W. put a sign opposite *indavo* as if he meant to make a  
text-critical remark about it. His Collation-book notes no variant ms.  
reading; but SPP. reports *idáṁ vaḥ* and *indaváḥ;* none give  
*índavaḥ*.⌋ †⌊As if it were *índavaḥ* = *índtimantaḥ*.⌋
