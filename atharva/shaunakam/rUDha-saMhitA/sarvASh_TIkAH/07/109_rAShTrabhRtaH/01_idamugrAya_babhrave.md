### Translation
1. This homage to the formidable brown one, who among the dice is  
self-controller; with ghee do I aid (?) Kali; may he be gracious to us  
in such plight.

### Notes
⌊In **a**, Henry would suppress either *idám* or else *námo*.⌋ Ppp.  
combines *yo ‘kṣeṣu* in **b**, and reads *kalyam* in **c**. The comm.  
explains *babhráve* as *babhruvarṇāyāi ’tatsaṁjñakāya dyūtajayakāriṇe  
devāya;* of Kali he says *parājayahetuḥ pañcasaṁkhyāyukto ‘kṣaviṣayo  
‘yaḥ kalir ity ucyate*, and quotes TB. i. 5. 11¹; *śikṣāmi* is either  
*tāḍayāmi* or *samarthaṁ kartum icchāmi*.

My homage to the strong, the brown, the sovran lord among the dice! Butter on Kali I bestow: may he be kind to one like me.
