### Translation
7. If (*yát*) a suppliant I call on the gods, if we have dwelt in Vedic  
studentship, if I take up the brown dice—let them be gracious to us in  
such plight.

### Notes
Ppp. begins with *yad devān*, and reads *ūvima* in **b**. One would like  
to emend to *ālebhé* in **c**.

As I invoke the Gods at need, as I have lived in chastity, May these, when I have grasped the Dice, the brown, be kind to one like me.
