### Translation
1. We would fain call hither for \[our\] welfare Tārkshya, this  
vigorous, god-quickened, powerful overcomer of chariots, ⌊Tārkshya,⌋  
having uninjured tires, fight-conquering, swift.

### Notes
The verse is RV. x. 178. 1 and SV. i. 332. For our *sáhovānam*, in  
**b**, RV. reads *sahā́vānam* and SV. *sahovā́nam;* both have *pṛtanā́jam*  
(undivided in RV. *pada*-text) in **c** instead of *-ājím* (p. *-ā॰jím*)  
and, in **d**, the RV. *pada*-text understands *ihā́* as simply *ihá*,  
ours as *ihá: ā́*. The comm. also reads *pṛtanājam*, but explains it as  
containing either the root *aj* or *ji*.
