### Translation
2. He that attacks (*abhi-i*) every other day, on both \[intermediate\]  
days, let him, baffled (*avratá*), attack this frog.

### Notes
The comm. reads *ubhayedyus*. The verse, though really metrical (11 +  
12) is treated by the Anukr. as prose (24 syllables).

May he, the lawless one, who comes alternate or two following days, pass over and possess the frog.
