### Translation
1. \[Him\], the heavenly eagle, milky, great, embryo of the waters, bull  
of the herbs, gratifying with rain from close by (?), in our cow-stall  
standing in wealth may \[one\] establish.

### Notes
The first three pādas are, with variants, RV. i. 164. 52 **a, b, c**  
(also TS. iii. 1. 11³). Our very senseless *payasám* in **a** is RV.  
*vāyasám* (TS. *vay-*); our *vṛṣabhám* (so TS.) in **b** is RV.  
*darśatám;* and RV. (not TS.) has *vṛṣṭíbhis* in **c**. Then, for **d**,  
RV. has *sárasvantam ávase johavīmi* (TS. nearly the same), which makes  
the whole verse one consistent construction; our **d** fits very badly.  
Ppp. reads *samudram* for *suparṇam* in **a**, and has, for **c, d**,  
*abhīptaṁ rayyā tapanti sarasvantaṁ rahiṣṭhyā* (i.e. *rayiṣṭhām*)  
*sādaye ’ha*. The comm. understands Sarasvant to be intended throughout  
the verse, and supplies *indras* as subject for the concluding verb;  
*abhīpatas* he explains variously: *sarvataḥ saṁgatā āpo ‘smin* or  
*abhipatanaśīlān vṛṣṭikāmān sarvaprāṇinaḥ*. Henry renders "those who  
invoke him."
