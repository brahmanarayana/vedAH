### Translation
2. Ye, as many of my rivals as look upon me coming—as the rising sun  
that of sleepers, do I take to myself the splendor of them that hate me.

### Notes
⌊Ppp. reads *varcāṅsi yavater iva: evā sapatnānām ahaṁ varca indriyam ā  
dadhe.*⌋ *Pratipaśyatha*, literally 'that meet me with your looks' as I  
come. The comm. reads *-paśyata*. The Anukr. appears to allow the  
contraction *sūrye ’va* in **c**.  
  
The first *anuvāka* ends with this hymn; it contains 13 (14) hymns and  
28 verses; the quoted Anukr. says *aṣṭāv ādye;* and another quotation,  
given in many mss. (Bp.P.M.W.D.T.), says *prathame trayodaśa sūktāḥ*,  
thus approving the division made in our edition.
