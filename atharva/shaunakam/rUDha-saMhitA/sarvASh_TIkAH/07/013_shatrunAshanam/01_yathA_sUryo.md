### Translation
1. As the sun rising takes to itself the brilliancies (*téjas*) of the  
asterisms, so of both women and men that hate me I take to myself the  
splendor.

### Notes

As the Sun, rising, taketh to himself the brightness of the stars,. So I assume the glory of women and men mine enemies. All ye amang my rivals who behold me as I come to you, I seize the glory of my foes as the Sun, rising, theirs who sleep.
