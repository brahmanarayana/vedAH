### Translation
1. Fly forth from here, O evil sign (*lakṣmī́*); disappear from here; fly  
forth from yonder; with a hook of metal (*ayasmáya*) we attach thee to  
him that hates \[us\].

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **a** *pāpa-* for *pāpi*, and, for **d**, *ya dviṣmas  
tasmin tvā sajjāmaḥ*. The comm. has at the end *sacāmasi*. He  
paraphrases *pāpi lakṣmi* by *pāparūpiṇy alakṣmi;* it might be rendered  
also by 'luck' or 'fortune'; the expression is found also in MB. i. 4.  
1, 5.

Hence. Evil Fortune! fly away, vanish from this place and from that. We fix thee with an iron hook unto the man who hateth us.
