### Translation
4. These same have I separated, like kine scattered on a barren  
(*khilá*); let the good (*púṇya*) signs stay; those that are evil have I  
made disappear.

### Notes
The *pada*-mss. read in **a** *enāḥ;* probably it is rather end 'thus.'  
The comm. reads blunderingly at the end *anīnaśan*, and understands  
*tās* as its subject, as if the form were not causative.\* He glosses  
*khila* by *vraja*. The *pada*-reading *vísthitāḥ॰iva* in **b** is  
according to Prāt. iv. 77. ⌊In a good pasture, the cows would keep close  
together; on a barren, they would naturally scatter. Quite otherwise  
Pischel, *Ved. Stud.* ii. 205.⌋ ⌊ĀpśS. iv. 15. 4 may be compared.⌋ ⌊The  
Anukr. does not note that **c** is catalectic.⌋ \*⌊Alternatively,  
however, he does take it as a causative.⌋

I have disparted these and those like cows who stray on common land. Here let auspicious Fortunes stay: hence have I banished evil ones.
