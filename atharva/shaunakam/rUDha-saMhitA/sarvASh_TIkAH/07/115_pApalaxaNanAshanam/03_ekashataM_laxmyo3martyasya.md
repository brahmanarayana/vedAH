### Translation
3. A hundred and one \[are\] the signs of a mortal, born from his birth  
together with his body; the worst of these we send forth out from here;  
to us, O Jātavedas, confirm propitious ones.

### Notes
The Anukr. appears to allow the contraction *śivā ’sm-* in **d**. ⌊As to  
"101," see iii. 11. 5 note.⌋
