### Comment
The first two verses are found also in Pāipp. xx. It is used by Kāuś. (18. 16-18) in rites against nirṛti ('perdition'), with the driving off of a crow to whose leg certain things have been fastened, and with casting into the water certain wraps or garments. The comm. quotes it also from the śāntikalpa (6. 16) in expiatory rites.
