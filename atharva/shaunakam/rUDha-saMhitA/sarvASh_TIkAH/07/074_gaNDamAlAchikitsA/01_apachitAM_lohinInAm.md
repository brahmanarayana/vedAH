### Translation
1. Of the red *apacít's* black is the mother, so have we heard; by the  
root of the divine anchoret I pierce them all.

### Notes
The comm. makes at great length several discordant attempts to explain  
who the divine anchoret (*múni*) is. His explanation of *apacit*, fuller  
than elsewhere given, may be reported: *doṣavaśād apāk cīyamānā galād  
ārabhya adhastāt kakṣādisaṁdhisthāneṣu prasṛtā gaṇḍamātāḥ: yadvā  
’pacinvanti puruṣasya vīryam ity apacitaḥ*. ⌊At vi. 83. 3, the *apacít*  
is "daughter of the black one."⌋

Black is the mother, we have heard, from whom the red-hued Pustules sprang. With the divine ascetic's root I pierce and penetrate them all.
