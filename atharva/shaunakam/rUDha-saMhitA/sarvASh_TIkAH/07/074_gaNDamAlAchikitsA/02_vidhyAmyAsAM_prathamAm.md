### Translation
2. I pierce the first of them; I pierce also the midmost; now the hinder  
one of them I cut into like a tuft (*stúkā*).

### Notes
The comm. says, at the end, *yatho ”rṇāstukā ’nāyāsena chidyate tathā*.  
  
It is strange that the two following verses, which concern different  
matters, are combined with the above and with one another. But the hymn  
is not divided by any one of the authorities.

I pierce the foremost one of these, I perforate the middlemost, And here I cut the hindermost asunder like a lock of hair.
