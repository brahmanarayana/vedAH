### Translation
2. Not heat burned, not cold smote; let the earth, of quick drops, burst  
forth; waters verily flow ghee for him; where Soma is, there is it ever  
excellent.

### Notes
In **b**, Ppp. reads *sadasyate* for *nabhatām;* in **c**, *sadam* for  
*ghṛtam*. With **c** compare RV. i. 125. 5 **c**.

Let not the Sun's heat burn, nor cold destroy her. Let Earth with all her quickening drops burst open. Even for her the waters flow, and fatness: where Soma is even there is bliss for ever.
