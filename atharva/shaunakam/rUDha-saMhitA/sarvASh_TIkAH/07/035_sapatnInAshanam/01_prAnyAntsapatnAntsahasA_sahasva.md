### Translation
1. Overpower away with power \[our\] other rivals; thrust back, O  
Jātavedas, those unborn; fill this royalty unto good fortune; let all  
the gods revel after him.

### Notes
Of this verse also the first half, with a wholly different second half,  
is found in VS. (xv. 2), TS. (iv. 3. 12¹), and MS. (ii. 8. 7); all read,  
for **a**, *sáhasā jātā́n prá ṇudā naḥ sapátnān*. Our second half,  
especially the last pāda, is rather wanting in connection with what  
precedes; Ppp. improves **d** by reading *anu tvā devās sarve juṣantām*.  
The comm. explains *rāṣṭram* by *asmadīyaṁ janapadam*, and *enam* by  
*śatruhananakarmaṇaḥ prayoktāram*.

Subdue with conquering might his other rivals, those yet unborn repel, O Jatavedas. For great felicity protect this kingdom, and in this man let all the Gods be joyful.
