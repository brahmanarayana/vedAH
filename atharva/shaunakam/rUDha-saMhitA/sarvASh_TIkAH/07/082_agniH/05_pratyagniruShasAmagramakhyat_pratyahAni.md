### Translation
5. Agni hath looked forth to meet the apex of the dawns, to meet the  
days, \[he\] first, Jātavedas, and to meet the rays of the sun in many  
places; to meet heaven-and-earth he stretched out.

### Notes
A variation of the preceding verse, perhaps suggested by RV. iv. 13. 1  
**a**, which is identical with its first pāda; its second half agrees  
much more closely with the version of the other texts than does 4 **c,  
d**. The comm. is still more faithful to that version, by giving the  
(preferable) reading *purutrā* in **c**.

Agni hath looked upon the spring of Mornings, looked on the days, the earliest Jatavedas. So he in countless places hath extended, full against heaven and earth, the beams of Surya.
