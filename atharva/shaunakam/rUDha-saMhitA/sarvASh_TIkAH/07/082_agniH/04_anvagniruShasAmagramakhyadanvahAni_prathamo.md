### Translation
4. Agni hath looked after the apex of the dawns, after the days, \[he\]  
first, Jātavedas, a sun, after the dawns, after the rays, after  
heaven-and-earth he entered.

### Notes
*Anu* 'after' seems here to have a distributive force: Agni is ever  
present to meet the first dawn etc. with his brightness; or it is the  
opposite of *prati* in vs. 5: *anu* 'from behind,' as *prati* 'from in  
front.' The verse is found as VS. xi. 17, and in TS. iv. i. 2², TB. 1.  
2. 1²³, and MS. i. 8. 9. All these have in **c** *ánu sū́ryasya purutrā́  
ca raśmī́n* (an easier and better reading), and, at the end, VS. MS. give  
*ā́ tatantha*, and TS.TB. *ā́ tatāna*. This verse and the next are  
repeated as xviii. i. 27, 28.

Agni hath looked upon the spring of Morning, looked on the days, the earliest Jatavedas. So, following the gleams of Morning, Surya hath entered heaven and earth as his possession.
