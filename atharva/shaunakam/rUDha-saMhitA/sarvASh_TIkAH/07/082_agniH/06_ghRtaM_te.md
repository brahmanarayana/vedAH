### Translation
6. Ghee for thee, Agni, in the heavenly station; with ghee Manu kindleth  
thee today; let the goddesses thy kin (*natpī́*) bring thee ghee; ghee to  
thee let the kine milk, O Agni.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *duhrate* in **d**. The comm. gives *naptryas* in **c**, and  
declares it to mean the waters; it is more probably the daughters of the  
sky in general.
