### Translation
2. What \[is\] ill-done, what pollution, or what we have practised  
evilly—by thee, O all-ways-facing off-wiper, we wipe that off  
(*apa-mṛj*).

### Notes
Or (**b**) 'if we have gone about evilly.' All the authorities have  
*táyā* instead of *tváyā* at beginning of **c**, but both texts make the  
obviously necessary correction. The comm. reads *tvayā*.

Whatever evil we have done, whatever vile or sinful act, With thee, O Apamarga, who lookest all ways, we wipe it off.
