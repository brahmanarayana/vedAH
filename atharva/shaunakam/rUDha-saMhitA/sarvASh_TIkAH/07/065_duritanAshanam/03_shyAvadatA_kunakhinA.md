### Translation
3. If we have been together with one dark-toothed, ill-nailed,  
mutilated, by thee, O off-wiper, we wipe off all that.

### Notes
The comm. reads *vaṇḍena* in **b**; and he has also *āśima* for *āsima*,  
which is not a bad emendation.

If with the cripple we have lived, whose teeth are black and nails deformed, With thee, O Apamarga, we wipe all that ill away from us.
