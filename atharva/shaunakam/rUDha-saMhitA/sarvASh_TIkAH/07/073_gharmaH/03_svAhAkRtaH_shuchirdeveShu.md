### Translation
3. The bright (*śúci*) sacrifice to the gods accompanied with "hail,"  
the Aśvins' bowl that is for the gods to drink of—this all the  
immortals, enjoying, lick respectively by the Gandharva's mouth.

### Notes
The two Sūtras and Ppp. agree in reading *gharmas* for *yajñas* in  
**a**; the former have also *īm* for *u* in **c**. The comm. declares  
this verse to be used after the *gharma* offering; the "bowl" is the one  
called *upayamana;* the "Gandharva" is either the sun or the fire.

Pure with the Gods is sacrifice with cry of Hail! That is the Asvins' cup whence Gods are wont to drink. Yea, the Immortal Ones accept it, one and all, and come to kiss that cup with the Gandharva's mouth.
