### Translation
10. O Agni, be bold unto great good-fortune; let thy brightnesses  
(*dyumná*) be highest; put together a well-ordered house-headship;  
trample on the greatnesses of them that play the foe.

### Notes
The verse is (as noted above) RV. v. 28. 3, and found also in TB. and  
MS., and further in VS. xxxiii. 12 and ĀpśS. iii. 15. 5—everywhere  
without variant. Our comm. explains *śardha* as = *ārdrahṛdayo bhava*.  
The Prāt. iv. 64, 83 prescribes *jāḥpatyám* as *pada*-reading in **c**,  
but all the *pada*-mss. read *jāḥ॰patyám*, divided, and SPP. accordingly  
gives that form in his *pada*-text. The RV. *pada* reads *jāḥpatyám* and  
*jāḥpátiḥ*, but, strangely, *jā́ḥ॰patim* (the two latter occurring only  
once each). ⌊Winternitz, *Hochzeitsrituell*, p. 57, cites the verse.⌋

Show thyself strong for mighty bliss, O Agni! Most excellent be thine effulgent splendours! Make easy to maintain our household lordship, and overcome the might of those who hate us.
