### Translation
8. Lowing (*hin̄-kṛ*), mistress of good things, seeking her calf with her  
mind, hath she come in; let this inviolable one (*aghnyā́*) yield (*duh*)  
milk for the Aśvins; let her increase unto great good-fortune.

### Notes
RV. (as above) reads *abhyā́gāt* (p. *abhí: ā́: agāt*) at end of **b**.  
The RV. *pada*-text divides *hin̄॰kṛṇvatī́* at the beginning, and SPP.  
gives the same reading; but our *pada*-mss. (with the doubtful  
exception of D.) read here *hin̄kṛ-*, without division; at ix. 10. 5 they  
agree with RV. The verse accompanies, says the comm., the coming up of  
the cow for milking.

She, sovran of all treasures, is come hither yearning in spirit for her calf, and lowing. May this cow yield her milk for both the Asvins, and may she prosper to our great advantage.
