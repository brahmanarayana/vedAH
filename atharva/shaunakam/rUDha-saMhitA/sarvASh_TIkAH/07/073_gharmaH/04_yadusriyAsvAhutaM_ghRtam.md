### Translation
4. The offered ghee, the milk, which is in the ruddy \[kine\], that is  
your portion here, ye Aśvins; come; ye sweet ones, maintainers of the  
council (*vidátha*), lords of the good, drink ye the heated *gharmá* in  
the shining space of the sky.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
In **b**, śśS. has *su* for *sa;* at the end, AśS. has *somyam madhu*  
(for *rocane divaḥ*). There ought to be more than one accent on the  
series of vocatives in **c**, to guide us to their right combination,  
which is doubtful. The comm. takes *mādhvī* as *madhuvidyāveditārāu*.

Milk, molten butter offered when the mornings break,--this is your portion, Asvins! Come ye hitherward. Lords of the brave, balm-lovers, guards of sacrifice, drink ye the warm libation in the light of heaven.
