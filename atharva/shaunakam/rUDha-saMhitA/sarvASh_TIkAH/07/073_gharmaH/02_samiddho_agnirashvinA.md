### Translation
2. Kindled is Agni, O ye Aśvins; heated is your *gharmá;* come! now, ye  
bulls, the milch-kine are milked here, ye wondrous ones (*dasrá*)-, the  
pious ones are reveling.

### Notes
AśS. and śśS. both read *gāvas* for *nūnam* in **c**, and (with Ppp.)  
*kāravas* for *vedhasas* at the end. The first half-verse occurs also in  
VS. (as xx. 55 **a, b**), which omits *vām* in **b**, and reads *virā́ṭ  
sutáḥ* for *ā́ gatam*.
