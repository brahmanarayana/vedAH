### Translation
1. Kindled, O ye two bulls, is Agni, the charioteer of heaven; heated is  
the *gharmá;* honey is milked for your food (*íṣ*); for we singers  
(*kārú*), of many houses, call on you, O Aśvins, in joint revelings.

### Notes
The translation implies in **b** the accent *duhyáte*, which is found in  
no ms.; the comm. makes the same construction. Ppp. reads *aśvinā* for  
*vṛṣaṇā* in **a**; and also, with both AśS. and śśS., *purutamāsas* in  
**c**; doubtless our word is a corruption of this ⌊Roth, ZDMG. xlviii.  
107⌋. But for *rathī*, in **a**, AśS. has *ratis* and śśS. *rayis*,  
plain corruptions. The *gharmá* is either the hot drink into which fresh  
milk is poured, or the heated vessel containing it. The comm. interprets  
the verses according to their order and application in AśS. He explains  
the *gharma* as the heated sacrificial butter in the *mahāvīra* dish.

Inflamed is Agni, Heroes! charioteer of heaven. The caldron boils: the meath is drained to be your food. For we, O Asvins, singers sprung from many a house, invite you to be present at our banquetings.
