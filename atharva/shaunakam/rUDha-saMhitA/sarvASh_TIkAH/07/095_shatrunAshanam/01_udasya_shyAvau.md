### Translation
1. Up have flown his two dark-brown (*śyāvá*) quiverers (? *vithurá*),  
as two vultures to the sky—up-heater-and-forth-heater, up-heaters of his  
heart.

### Notes
The comm. renders *vithurāú* by *saṁtataṁ calanaśīlāu* (also  
*vyathanaśīlāu bhayavantāu*), and understands by them (through the hymn)  
either the two lips or the breath and expiration of the enemy who is  
represented by the frog (*maṇḍūkātmanā bhāvitasya*)—which is very  
unsatisfactory. To the vultures he applies the epithet *tārkṣyāu*. Roth  
suggests, as intended in the second half-verse, the heat and passion of  
love, which are to be expelled from some woman's heart.

To heaven, as 'twere, have soared this man's two vultures, staggering, dusky hued. The Parcher and the Drier-up, the pair who parch and dry his heart.
