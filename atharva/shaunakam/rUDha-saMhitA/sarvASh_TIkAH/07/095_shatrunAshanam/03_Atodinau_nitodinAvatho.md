### Translation
3. The (two) on-thrusters, down-thrusters, also together-thrusters: I  
shut up his urinator who bore \[away\] from here—\[whether\] woman  
\[or\] man.

### Notes
*Strī́m* in **d** would be a welcome emendation: "of the man who bore  
away the woman from here"; but the analogy of i. 8. 1 **c** favors the  
text as given by the mss. The comm. supplies *āsmākīnaṁ dhanam* as  
object of *jabhāra;* or, alternatively, he takes the latter as =  
*prahṛtavān asmān bādhitavān;* *meḍhra* (*mih* + *tra*) he paraphrases  
with *marmasthānopalakṣaṇam*. His ignorance of the sense of the hymn is  
as great as that of Kāuś.—or as ours. SPP. retains the *ḥ* of *itáḥ*  
before *strī́* in **d**, against his usual practice elsewhere, and with  
only a small minority of his mss.

Like two that thrust, like two that pierce, like two that strike with mutual blows. I bind the conduit of the man or dame who hence hath taken aught.
