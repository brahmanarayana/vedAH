### Translation
1. Down from the sky the seven rays of the sun make pass the waters,  
streams of ocean; these have made fall thy sting (*śalyá*).

### Notes
The comm. regards *śalya* as used figuratively of a stinging disease:  
*śalyavat pīḍākāriṇaṁ kāsaśleṣmādirogam.* The seven rays are to him the  
seven forms of the sun, as given in TA. i. 7. 1.
