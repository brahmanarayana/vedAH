### Comment
Wanting in Pāipp. Used in Kāuś. (16. 7) in one of the battle rites, for terrifying a hostile army, with arming a king or kshatriya; for its connection with hymn 117, see under that hymn; and some mss. read it in 39. 28, in a rite against witchcraft (probably wrongly, as the comm. knows no such use). Vāit. has it (34. 12) in the sattra sacrifice, with arming a king.


### Translations
Translated: Henry, 46, 125; Griffith, i. 384.
