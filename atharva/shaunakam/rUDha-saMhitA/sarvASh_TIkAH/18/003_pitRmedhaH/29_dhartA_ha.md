### Translation
29. Dhartar the maintainer shall maintain thee aloft, as Savitar the  
light (*bhānú*) to the sky above; to the world-makers etc. etc.

### Notes
The translation follows the comm. in connecting *ūrdhvám* with what  
precedes, instead of (as the meter suggests, and as is perhaps rather to  
be preferred) with what follows it.\* The definition by the Anukr. of  
the meter of these five verses is not very acceptable; the refrain of  
25-28 has 35 syllables (12: 12 + 11); the prefixed variable part varies  
from 12 to 14; 28 has 46 syllables (11 + 12: 12 + 11). ⌊Cf. note to  
excerpts from Anukr., above, p. 847, top.⌋  
  
\*⌊There is a clear play of words in *dhartā dharuṇo dhārayātāi*, not  
without conscious reminiscence, perhaps, of the familiar plays in  
*varaṇo vārayātāi* at x. 3. 5 and vi. 85. 1, and in *vār idaṁ vārayātāi  
varaṇāvatyām adhi* at iv. 7. 1.† Moreover, I think that these  
derivatives of root *dhṛ* make clear reference to *dhruvā diś*, the  
'fixed direction' or 'steadfast region,' and that *ūrdhvam* makes  
similar reference to the 'upward region.' Render perhaps: 'Let the  
Steadier, steadying, steady thee \[in the steadfast region\], as aloft  
\[that is, in the upward region\] Savitar \[steadieth *or* maintaineth\]  
the light, the sky above.' Cf. my note, p. 847, ¶ 8.—†Cf. xix. 36. 6  
**d**.⌋

May the strong firm Sustainer bear thee upright, as Savitar bears light above the heaven. Those who give room, who made the paths, we worship, you mid the Gods, whe share the gifts we offer.
