### Translation
10. Let the soma-drinking (*somyá*) Fathers anoint me with splendor, the  
gods with honey, with ghee; making me pass further on unto sight, let  
them increase me, attaining old age, unto old age.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Some of the mss. (including our D.R.p.m.T.) read *ájantu* in **b**;  
possibly it is their way of emending the false accent of *áñjantu;*  
doubtless we ought to change this to *añjántu* rather than to admit the  
modulated stem *áñja*. The *pratīka* (*varcasā mām*) applies either to  
this verse or to the next, or probably is used to include both; whatever  
it applies to is used, according to Kāuś. (81. 47; 87. 4), in connection  
with rinsing the mouth at the end of the cremation ceremony and at the  
beginning of the *piṇḍapitṛyajña;* and also (86. 17), with 3. 61-67, in  
the ceremony of interring the bones, in connection with supporting the  
*dhruvanas*\* on the north-west of the fire. The comm. takes notice of  
only the first of these three applications. \*⌊Caland, WZKM. viii. 369,  
would read *dhuvanāny upayachante* at 86. 16: I suppose he would render,  
'they offer fannings \[to the relics\].' But are we sure that 86. 17  
goes with 86. 16 and forms a part of the *dhuvana* ceremony?—Cf. my note  
to vs. 17 below.—The non-lingualization of the first *n* gives the  
strongest possible support for *dhuvanāni* as against *dhru-*.⌋

With splendour may the Fathers, meet for Soma, with mead and. fatness may the Gods anoint me. Lead me on farther to extended vision, and prosper me through life of long duration.
