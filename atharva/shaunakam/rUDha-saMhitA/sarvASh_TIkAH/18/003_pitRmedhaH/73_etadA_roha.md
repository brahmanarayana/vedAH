### Translation
73. Ascend thou this, gaining (*ud-mṛj*) vigor (*váyas*); thine own  
\[people\] shine here greatly; go forth, unto \[them\],—be not left  
behind midway—unto the world of the Fathers that is first there.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Nearly all the mss. (all save our I.O.R., and one or two of SPP's)  
accent in **a** *unmṛjā́nas*, -which our edition accordingly reads; SPP.  
makes the proper emendation to *-jānás* (cf. *mṛjānās*, vs. 17, note).  
The comm. glosses *váyas* with *antarikṣam*, because *viyanti gacchanty  
asmin!* and then of course makes it the object of *ā roha*, explaining  
*unmṛjānas* as *śarīrād utkramaṇena svātmānaṁ śodhayan*. For the use of  
the verse in Kāuś. 85. 24, with 2. 37, see under the latter. ⌊Cf. p.  
848, ¶8.⌋  
  
⌊Here ends the third *anuvāka*, with 1 hymn and 73 verses. The quoted  
Anukr. says *saptatis tryadhikā paraḥ:* cf. page 814.⌋

Mount to this life, removing all defilement: here thine own kindred shine with lofty splendour. Depart thou; be not left behind: go forward, first of those here, unto the world of Fathers.
