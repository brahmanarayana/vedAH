### Translation
58. Unite thyself (*sam-gam*) with the Fathers, with Yama, with thy  
sacred and charitable works in the highest firmament; abandoning what is  
reproachful, come again home;—let him unite himself with a body, very  
splendid.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The corresponding verse in RV. (x. 14. 8) reads in **c** *hitvā́ya*, and  
in **d** gachasva, continuing the general construction of the verse. The  
first half is found also in TA. (in vi. 4. 2), which has *svadhā́bhis*  
for *yaména*, and adds after it another *sám*. We had the last pāda  
above, as 2. 10 **d**. The mss. are divided between *ávadyam* and  
*avadyám* in c; both editions give *avadyám* ⌊with RV.⌋.

Meet Yama, meet the Fathers, meet the merit of virtuous action in the loftiest heaven. Leave sin and evil, seek anew thy dwelling: so bright with glory let him join his body.
