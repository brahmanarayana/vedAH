### Translation
19. What of you is joyous, O Fathers, and delectable (*somyá*),  
therewith be at hand (*sac*), for ye are of own splendor; do ye, rapid  
(? *árvan*) poets, listen, beneficent, invoked at the council.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Nearly all our mss. (save Op.R.s.m.) accent *pitáras* in **a**; SPP.  
reports only a single *pada*-ms. as doing so, and of course reads  
*pitaras*, as does our text by emendation. Nearly all the authorities,  
again, give *bhūtám* at end of **b**; ⌊but Whitney's Op. has *bhūtā́;*  
and his⌋ K. has *bhūtá*, as have three of SPP's, who reads *bhūtá*. ⌊The  
word itself is lost from the comm., but glossed by *bhavatha*.⌋ We ought  
to have emended to *bhūtá*. Once more, all the authorities without  
exception accent *suvidatrā́s*, which SPP. accordingly retains, while we  
have made the necessary emendation to *-dátrās*. One is tempted to  
change *arvāṇas* in **c** to *arvāñcas*. The extra syllable in **b**  
suggests corruption; ⌊and so, perhaps, does the fact that in O.R. the  
avasāna is before *bhūtám*, not after it⌋.

Fathers, be glorious in yourselves, and follow all that is glad in you and meet for Soma. Give ear and listen, swiftly-moving Sages, benevolent, invoked in our assembly.
