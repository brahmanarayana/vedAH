### Translation
37. Water-purifying art thou; honey-purifying art thou; wind-purifying  
art thou.

### Notes
The comm. regards both these prose verses (*yajurmantra*) as addressed  
to Agni, quoting RV. iv. 58. 3 and vi. 16. 39 to prove the applicability  
to him of the epithets in 36. The *sūtras* make no use of them save by  
their inclusion in the series 25-37 in Kāuś. 85. 26: see above, under  
vs. 25. The Anukr., in counting the syllables of 36, restores both the  
elided initial *a*'s.  
  
    
⌊**Verses 38 and 39** are addressed to the oblation-carts. The  
rearrangement of the RV. pādas in the AV. text is of such critical  
interest that it is worth a little space to exhibit the method to the  
eye.—The *yuje vām* etc. of the RV. seems to be clearly prefatory, and  
probably few will deny that the RV. order is the more nearly original,  
and that the AV. order and readings are secondary.
