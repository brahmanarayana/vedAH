### Translation
7. Here is one for thee, beyond is one for thee; enter thou into union  
with the third light; at entrance be thou fair (*cā́ru*) with \[thy\]  
body, loved of the gods in the highest station.

### Notes
The verse is RV. x. 56. 1, which reads in **c** *tanvàs*, and in **d**  
*janítre* (for *sadhásthe*). It is also found in SV. (i. 65), TB. (in  
iii. 7. 1³), TA. (vi. 3. 1; 4. 2), and Āp. (ix. i. 17); in **a**,  
TB.¯Āp. have *u* (for *ū* before *te*); in **c**, all have *saṁvéśanas*,  
while SV. gives *tanvè* and the others *tanúvāi;* in **d**, TB.Āp. read  
*priyé*, and SV.TB.Āp. agree with RV. in *janítre*. According to Kāuś.  
(80. 36), the verse accompanies the carrying of the fire at the head of  
the procession to the funeral pile; as the comm. states it, carrying the  
three fires, in the case of one who has established sacrificial fires.  
The three "lights" are thus understood to be the three sacrificial  
fires; but they are probably, in the original meaning of the verse,  
rather three regions of light, to the highest of which the deceased is  
to be translated.

Here is one light for thee, another yonder: enter the third and be therewith united. Uniting with a body be thou lovely, dear to the Gods in their sublimest mansion.
