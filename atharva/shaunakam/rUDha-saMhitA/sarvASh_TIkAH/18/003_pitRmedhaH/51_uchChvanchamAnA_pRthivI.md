### Translation
51. Let the earth kindly remain swelling up, for let a thousand props  
support (*upa-śri*) it; let these houses, dripping with ghee, pleasant,  
be forever a refuge for him there (*átra*).

### Notes
⌊As to *uchváñc-*, see note to vs. 50.⌋ The verse is RV. x. 18. 12,  
which in **c** reads *bhavantu* for *syonā́s*. TA. (in vi. 7. 1) has in  
**a** *úchmáñc-* ⌊so Calc. ed.: Poona has *ucchmáñc-*⌋ and *hí*  
⌊*tíṣṭhasi*⌋ for *sú* ⌊*tiṣṭhatu*⌋; in **b** it leaves *śrayantām*  
unaccented (if it be not a misprint); ⌊so Calc.: Poona has it rightly  
*śráy-*;⌋ in **c** it ⌊has *madhuścúto* for *ghṛtaścúto*, and⌋ omits  
*syonā́s* (or *bhavantu*); ⌊and begins **d** with *víśvā́hā:* so accented  
in both ed's, as if it were two words, as in RV. i. 52. 11; 130. 2 (*áhā  
víśvā*); iii. 54. 22⌋. The comm. reads in **b** *mithas*, but explains  
it as if *mitas* (*mīyamānā oṣadhayaḥ*). The Anukr. takes no notice of  
the extra syllable in **a**.

Now let the heaving earth be free from motion: yea, let a thousand clods remain above him. Be they to him a home distilling fatness: here let them ever be his place of refuge.
