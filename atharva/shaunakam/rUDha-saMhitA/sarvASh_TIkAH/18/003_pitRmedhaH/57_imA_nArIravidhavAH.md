### Translation
57. Let these women, not widows, well-spoused, touch themselves with  
ointment, with butter; tearless, without disease, with good treasures,  
let the wives ascend first to the place of union.

### Notes
This verse (= RV. x. 18. 7; TA. vi. 10. 2) was found above, as xii. 2.  
31, where see: it is not used by Kāuś. in the book of funeral and  
ancestral ceremonies.
