### Translation
54. The bowl that Atharvan bore full to Indra the vigorous, in that he  
makes a draught of what is well done; in that, soma (*índu*) ever  
purifies itself.

### Notes
The comm. supplies *yajñasya* to *sukṛtasya*, and, as subject of  
*kṛṇoti*, *ṛtvijāṁ gaṇaḥ*. ⌊The verse scans as 8 + 12: 11 + 11.⌋—⌊See my  
note on Part VII., above, p. 848.⌋
