### Translation
12. Mitra-and-Varuṇa have enclosed (*pari-dhā*) me; let the sacrificial  
posts of Aditi increase me; let Indra anoint splendor into my hands; let  
Savitar make me one attaining old age.

### Notes
Most of our mss. (all except Op.R.), and half of SPP's, read at the  
beginning *mítrāvaruṇā* (Bp. *-ṇāu*), vocative, which might stand if we  
altered *adhātām* to *-thām;* both editions give *mitrā́váruṇā*, ours by  
emendation. A variant for *sváravas* in **b** would be very welcome; the  
comm. gets rid of the difficulty in its characteristic way, by making  
the word an adjective to *ādityās*, and signifying either "making a  
pleasant sound" or "making a distress directed at our enemies"! The  
third pāda, if properly read, has a redundant syllable; but the Anukr.  
would apparently have us read *nyanaktu* in three syllables, as written.  
The Kāuś. uses the verse with washing the hands, at the end of the  
cremation ceremony (81. 46), and at the beginning of the  
*piṇḍapitṛyajña* (87. 3); the comm. notices only the latter of the two  
uses.

Mitra and Varuna have stood about me. Adityas, Sacirifical Posts exalt me! May Indra balm my hands with strength and splendour. A long, long life may Savitar vouchsafe me.
