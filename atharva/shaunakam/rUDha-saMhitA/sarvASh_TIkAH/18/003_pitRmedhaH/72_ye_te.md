### Translation
72. What Fathers of thine went away earlier and what later, for them let  
there go a brook of ghee, hundred-streamed, overflowing.

### Notes
The second half of the verse is nearly identical with 4. 57 **c, d**  
below. The mss. are not agreed about *kulyāì ’tu* ⌊so both ed's⌋: some  
(including our R. and ⌊one or⌋ two of SPP's) read *kulyè ’ta*. Our Bp.  
has *kulyā̀: etu;* but Op. accents *-yā́*, and Kp. has *kulya॰etu*. The  
noun is elsewhere accented *kulyā́*, and hence our text ought doubtless  
to he *kulyāí ’tu* ⌊so SPP's B.⌋. The verse is twice used with 4. 57 in  
Kāuś.: once (86. 2) in the ceremony of interment of the bones, on  
filling a dish (*caru*) with butter and honey and depositing it by the  
head ⌊see note to 4. 16⌋; and again (88. 17), in the *piṇḍapitṛyajña*,  
on smearing the *piṇḍas* with sacrificial butter.

To these, thy Fathers who have passed away at first and after- ward, Let the full brook of butter run, o'erflowing with a hundred streams.
