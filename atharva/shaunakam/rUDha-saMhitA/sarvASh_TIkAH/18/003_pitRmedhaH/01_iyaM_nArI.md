### Translation
1. This woman, choosing her husband's world, lies down (*ni-pad*) by  
thee that art departed, O mortal, continuing to keep \[her\] ancient  
duty (*dhárma*); to her assign thou here progeny and property.

### Notes
Verses 1-4 are translated and interpreted (I think, incorrectly) by  
Hillebrandt in ZDMG. xl. 708 ff. Kāuś. (80. 44) and the comm. declare  
that with this verse the wife is made to lie down beside her dead  
husband on the funeral pile. The comm. glosses *dharmām* with *sukṛtam*,  
and understands the sense of the pāda as it is translated above. The  
sense of **d** alone seems to indicate that the woman's action is  
nothing more than a show, expected to be followed by that of the next  
verse, since "progeny and property" are rewards for this life, not for  
the other. The comm. says it is meant for her next birth. TA. also has  
the verse (in vi. 1. 3), but reads for **c** *víśvam purāṇám ánu  
pāláyantī*—a very inferior text. Some of our mss. (O.Op.D.R.K.), and  
even the majority of SPP's, have in **c** *-pādáyantī*, but SPP. rightly  
accepts *-pālá-*; ⌊c.f. the phonetic relation of *udumbara* and  
*ulumbala*, above, 2. 13⌋.
