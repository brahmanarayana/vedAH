### Translation
30. In the eastern quarter, away from approach (?), do I set thee in  
*svadhā́;* arm-moved etc. etc.

### Notes
The phrase *purā́ samvṛ́taḥ* is very doubtful; perhaps it means rather,  
with the more literal sense of *purā́* and taking *-vṛt* as from root  
*vṛ*, 'before covering up' ⌊so Caland takes it: *Todtengebräuche*, p.  
154-5⌋; the comm., with his ordinary heedlessness of accent, makes it a  
pple. (as if *sáṁvṛtas*), rendering it "formerly covered up" (*pūrvaṁ  
saṁchāditaḥ*); or else, he says, *purā́* is instr. of *pur* = *śarīra*  
'body,' and it means "along with thy body" (*saśarīra eva san*). Kāuś.  
(80. 53) uses the verse (doubtless with the five that follow it) in  
fixing the body in place on the funeral pile; but he adds in the next  
rule that Uparibabhrava prohibits it. The comm. takes no notice of any  
such application.

Toward the eastward region I supply thee before thou goest homeward, with oblation, as in her arms, etc. (as in stanza 25).
