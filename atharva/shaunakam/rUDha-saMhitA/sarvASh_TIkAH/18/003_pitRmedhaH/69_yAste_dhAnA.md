### Translation
69. What grains I scatter along for thee, mixed with sesame, rich in  
*svadhā́*, be they for thee abundant (*vibhú*), prevailing; them let king  
Yama approve for thee.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
According to the comm., the grains are roasted barley; and *anu  
manyatām* means 'assent to thine enjoying'; ⌊at 4. 26 he says *tā dhānās  
tava bhogāya...anujānātu*. It depends on Yama's favor, says Weber,  
*Sb.*, 1896, p. 276, whether the dead man may have the benefit of his  
viaticum, or not.⌋ The verse is nearly identical with 4. 26, and is  
precisely identical with 4. 43. Its meter is (9 + 8: 8 + 10 = 35) rather  
irregular, and lacks a syllable of being full measure. ⌊With an easy  
double sandhi in **a** (*dhānānu-*) and the resolutions *taās* and *rājā  
anu* in **d**, it scans very well as 8 + 8: 8 + 12.⌋ Kāuś. (85. 27)  
directs that grains be scattered 'with verses that have the sign  
(*salin̄ga*)'; and Keśava states these verses to be the two that begin  
*yās te dhānās* (doubtless 3. 69 ⌊= 4. 43⌋ and 4. 26, since 3. 70 is  
evidently not *salin̄ga*), also 4. 32 and 33, and another not found in  
the text; the comm. says that such grains are to be put upon the bones  
with the two vss. that begin with *yās te dhānas*, ⌊by which he seems to  
mean 3. 69 (= 4. 43) and 4. 26 rather than 3. 69 and 70: at any rate, he  
immediately cites 3. 70 for another use⌋.  
  
⌊It is hardly doubtful that the black variety of sesame (*kṛṣṇatila*) is  
meant here, and that it is used, like the black rice and black victim,  
on account of its color: Pischel, GGA., 1897, p. 813. Pischel's view is  
confirmed by the fact that, if an offering to the Manes is performed  
apropos of some joyful occurrence in the family, barley is substituted  
for sesame: so śrāddhakalpa, iv. 5, as cited by Caland,  
*Totenverehrung*, p. 37.⌋

Grains which for thee I scatter, mixt with Sesamum, as holy food, May they for thee be excellent and potent: King Yama look on them as thine with favour!
