These six verses, 30-35, have the same refrain of 35 syllables as vss.

from 17 to 19 syllables; the definition of the Anukr. is approximately  
accurate.

Toward the upmost region I supply thee, before thou goest homeward, with oblation, as in her arms Earth bears the heaven above us. Those who give room, who made the paths, we worship, you, mid the Gods, who share the gifts we offer.
