### Translation
39. Be ye comfortable (? *svā́sastha*) for our soma.

### Notes
I yoke for you ancient worship (*bráhman*) with obeisances; the song  
(*ślóka*) goes forth like a patron (*sūrí*) on his road; let all the  
immortals hear that.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
⌊See my added note just preceding the translation of verse 38.⌋  
  
The verse is pāda **d** of the RV. vs. x. 13. 2 ⌊of which pādas **a, b,  
c** immediately precede in our AV. text⌋, followed by pādas **a, b, c**  
of the RV. vs. 1. RV. accents in **a** *svāsasthé;* ⌊the AV. accent  
seems wrong;⌋ both *pada*-texts divide *su॰ās-*. RV. further reads in  
⌊its **b**, our⌋ **c**, *etu* and *sūrés*, and at the end *amṛ́tasya  
putrā́ḥ*. The RV. verse is found also in VS. (xi. 5) and MS. (in ii. 7.  
1) with the same readings throughout as in RV.; and in TS. (iv. 1. 1²),  
which reads for our **c** *ví ślókā yanti pathyè ’va sū́rāḥ*, and in  
**d** varies from RV. etc. only by having *śṛṇvánti*. The comm. glosses  
*svā́sasthe* with *sukhāsanasthe;* he takes *yujé* as 1st sing., as it is  
translated above; the form might, of course, be 3d sing., like *duhé,  
śáye*, etc. ⌊In **d**, *śṛṇváttu* is a misprint for *śṛṇvántu*.⌋

Sit near, sit very near beside our Soma: for you I fit the ancient prayer with homage. The praise-song, like a chieftain on his pathway, spreads far and wide. Let all Immortals hear it.
