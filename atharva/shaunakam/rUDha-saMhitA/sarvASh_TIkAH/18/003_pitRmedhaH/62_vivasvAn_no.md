### Translation
62. Let Vivasvant set us in immortality; let death go away; let what is  
immortal come to us; let \[him\] defend these men until old age; let not  
their life-breaths (*ásu*) go to Yama.

### Notes
In śśS. iv. 16. 5, and MB. i. 1. 15 are found as the first two pādas of  
a verse our 62 **b** and 61 **a**. ⌊For the *na āitu* of our 62 *b*,  
both texts have *ma ā gāt* (the *me* is incongruent with the following  
nas*);* and for the *vivasvān* of our 61 **a**, both have *vaivasvato*,⌋  
thus rectifying the meter. The mss. accent *vivasvān* as in 61 **a**. We  
need to resolve *mó* to *mā́ u* in **d** to make a good *triṣṭubh* pāda;  
but the Anukr. would apparently read *mo* and balance the lack of a  
syllable by the redundancy of one in **c**. Possibly *ā́* is intrusive in  
**c**, and the meaning was 'defend from growing old.' The ritual use of  
the verse was explained above, under vs. 61.

In immortality Vivasvan set us! Go from us Death, come to us life eternal! To good old age may he protect these people: let not their spirits pass away to Yama.
