### Translation
24. We have made \[sacrifices\] for thee; we have been very active; the  
illuminating (*vi-bhā*) dawns have shone upon \[our\] rite (*ṛtá*); all  
that is excellent which the gods favor; may we talk big at the council,  
having good heroes.

### Notes
The first half-verse is, without variant, RV. iv. 2. 19 **a, b**; the  
second half is, also without variant, RV. ii. 23. 19 **c, d** (and VS.  
xxxiv. 58 **c, d**). Many of the mss., however, (including our Bs.O.K.)  
combine in **a-b** to *abhūma rtám*. The comm. has in **b** the strange  
reading *avasvan* (voc.: = *avanavan* or *pālaka*).

We have worked for thee, we have toiled and laboured: bright Dawns have shed their light upon our worship. All that the Gods regard with love is blessed. Loud may we speak, with heroes, in assembly.
