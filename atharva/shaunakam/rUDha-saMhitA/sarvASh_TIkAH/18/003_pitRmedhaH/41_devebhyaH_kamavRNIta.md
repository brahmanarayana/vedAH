### Translation
41. For the gods he chose death; for his progeny did he not choose  
immortality (*amṛ́ta*)? Brihaspati \[as\] seer extended the sacrifice;  
Yama left (*ā-ric*) his dear self (?).

### Notes
Or, 'the dear body (*tanū́*).' Here too the variations from the RV.  
version (x. 13. 4) seem to be corruptions only. RV. has *kám* in **b**,  
correlative to that in **a**; for **c** it gives *bṛ́haspátiṁ yajñám  
akṛṇvata ṛ́ṣim*, and at the end *prā́ ’rirecīt*. The comm. explains *ā  
rireca* by *samantād riktaṁ niḥsāram mṛtaṁ kṛtavān*. ⌊See Ludwig's  
discussion of the verse, *Ueber die kritik des RV.-textes*, Abh. der k.  
böhmischen Gesellschaft der Wiss., 1889, no. 5, p. 46.⌋

Chose he then, death for Gods to be their portion? Why chose he not for men a life eternal? Brihaspati span sacrifice, the Rishi; and Yama yielded up his own dear body.
