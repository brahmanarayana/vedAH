### Translation
66. As, longing with the heart, they looked upon thee, flying up\*  
\[as\] an eagle in the firmament (*nā́ka*), golden-winged messenger of  
Varuṇa, busy (*bhuraṇyú*) bird (*śakuná*) in the lair of Yama.

### Notes
The RV. has the verse (x. 123. 6), and it is found also in SV. (i. 320  
and ii. 1196), TB. (in ii. 5. 8⁵), and TA. (vi. 3. 1); all read alike  
throughout, save that the RV. (not the SV.) pada-text has the bad  
division and accent *abhí: ácakṣata*. Our P.M.O. have at the end  
*bhuraṇyám*. It is noteworthy that vss. 65 and 66, which have no  
apparent connection with funeral rites, and are not used by Kāuś. save  
in the group 61-67, are found almost together (separated only by our 3.  
7) also in the funeral collection of TA. \*⌊W's "up" for *úpa* may be an  
oversight: render perhaps 'they looked upon thee, flying onward (*úpa*)  
\[as\] an eagle'? Our comm., taking 'thee' as the dead man, construes,  
'flying unto the eagle'; but is not the verse addressed rather to Agni?  
cf. Griffith and comm. on TA.—Sāyaṇa, commenting on the RV. vs., says  
*he vena;* but in his comm. on TB. he says *he pravargyasvāmin:* an  
interesting diversity of opinion! Perhaps RV. ix. 85. 11 may throw light  
on our verse.⌋

They gaze on thee with longing in their spirit, as on an eagle that is mounting skyward; On thee with wings of gold, Varuna's envoy, the Bird that hasteth to the home of Yama.
