### Translation
45. Called unto \[are\] our delectable (*somyá*) Fathers, to dear  
deposits on the *barhís;* let them come; let them listen here; let them  
bless, let them aid us.

### Notes
The verse is RV. x. 15. 5, which differs only by omitting the  
meter-disturbing *nas* in **a**. Other texts (VS. xix. 57; TS. ii. 6.  
12³; MS. iv. 10. 6) agree with RV.; but TS. combines *té avantu* in  
**d**. ⌊Our **d** recurs at TB. ii. 6. 16².⌋ The use of the verse in  
Kāuś. and Vāit. is the same as that of vs. 44. The comm. glosses  
*nidhíṣu* by *nidhīyamāneṣu haviḥṣu*.

May they, the Fathers who deserve the Soma, invited to their favourite oblations. Laid on the sacred grass, come nigh and listen. May they be gracious unto us and bless us.
