### Translation
61. Let Vivasvant make for us freedom from fear, he who is  
well-preserving, quick-giving (? *-dā́nu*), well-giving; let these heroes  
be many here; let there be in me prosperity (*puṣṭá*) rich in kine, rich  
in horses.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
About half of SPP's mss., and one of ours (Op.), accent at the beginning  
*vívasvān*. The comm. explains *jīrádānus* alternatively by *jīvanasya  
kartā* and *vayohāner* (as if from *jṛ* 'waste away') *dātā*. ⌊Pāda  
**a** is found (with metrical rectification) as noted under vs. 62.⌋ The  
third pāda is identical with xii. 2. 21 **d**. By Kāuś. 81. 48 the verse  
is used at the end of the cremation ceremony with an oblation on the  
north; and again (82. 36), vss. 61 and 62 accompany each ⌊separately:  
see the comm., p. 176¹³⌋ a *sthālīpāka* offering to Vivasvant at the  
gathering of the bone-relics, while a third offering is made with them  
both together ⌊82. 37⌋. And further (86. 17), vss. 61-67 are used with  
3. 10 in the interment of the bones (see under the latter verse); the  
comm. describes it thus: "in the ceremony of gathering at the cemetery,  
the manager and all the relatives, standing in the western part of the  
cemetery, should approach the departed." The comm. adds one or two more  
minor applications. ⌊Verses 61 and 62 are translated by Hillebrandt,  
*Ved. Mythol.* i. 489.⌋
