### Translation
42. Thou, O Agni, Jātavedas, being praised, hast carried the offerings,  
having made them fragrant; thou hast given to the Fathers; they have  
eaten after their wont (? *svadháyā*); eat thou, O god, the presented  
oblations.

### Notes
The verse corresponds to RV. x. 15. 12, found also in VS. (xix. 66) and  
TS. (in ii. 6. 12⁵). ⌊Disregarding *īlitó*,⌋ RV. differs only by reading  
*kṛtvī́* at end of **b**; and VS. agrees with it in this, but has  
*kavyavāhana* for *jātavedas* in **a**; ⌊TS. agrees with AV.  
throughout⌋. Āp. (in i. 10. 14) and MB. (ii. 3. 17) have a verse that  
agrees with this in **b** and **c**, save that MB. has *prā ’dāt* for  
*prā ’dās* in **c**: but their **a** is *abhūn no dūto haviṣo  
jātavedāḥ;* and for **d**, Āp. has *prajānann agne punar apy ehi devān*,  
while MB. reads *p, a. p. ehi yonim*. The second half-verse occurs again  
below as 4. 65 **c, d**. Kāuś. (89. 13) makes the verse, with 4. 88, and  
with two verses not found elsewhere, accompany the feeding of the fire  
at the end of the *piṇḍapitṛyajña*. ⌊The forms *ávāṭ* and *akṣan* are  
treated, *Gram.* §890 a and §833 a. As for the sandhi *ḍhḍh* of the  
mss., see note to Prāt. i. 94.⌋

Thou, Agni Jatavedas, when entreated, didst bear our offerings, having made them fragrant. And give them to the Fathers who consumed them with Svadha. Eat, thou God, the gifts we bring thee.
