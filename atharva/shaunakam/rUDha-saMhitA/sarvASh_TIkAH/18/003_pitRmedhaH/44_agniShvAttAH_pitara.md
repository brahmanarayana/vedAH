### Translation
44. Ye fire-sweetened Fathers, come hither; sit on each seat,  
well-conducting ones; eat on the *barhís* the presented oblations, and  
assign to us wealth having all heroes.

### Notes
The verse is RV. x. 15. 11 through three pādas, RV. having for **d**:  
*áthā rayíṁ sárvavīraṁ dadhātana;* it also reads *attā́* ⌊p. *attá*⌋ in  
**c**; and three other texts (VS. xix. 59; TS. in ii. 6. 12²; MS. in iv.  
10. 6) agree throughout with it. The comm., too, gives *atta* and  
*dadhātana*. The Anukr. does not heed that we need at the end  
*dadhātana* to make a full *jagatī*. For the use of the verse by Kāuś.,  
with 45 and 46 and other verses, see under 1. 51; for its use by Vāit.,  
with 45 and other verses, see under 1. 44 and 51.

Fathers whom Agni's flames have tasted, come ye nigh: in per- fect order take ye each your proper place. Eat sacrificial food presented on the grass: grant riches with a multitude of hero sons.
