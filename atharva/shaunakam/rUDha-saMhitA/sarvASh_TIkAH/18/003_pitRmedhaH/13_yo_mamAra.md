### Translation
13. Him who died first of mortals, who went forth first to that world,  
Vivasvant's son, assembler of people, king Yama honor ye with oblation.

### Notes
The second half-verse is identical with 1. 49 **c, d**, and the first  
half is analogous with the same, **a, b** (= RV. x. 14. 1 etc.: see  
under 1. 49). The verse is redundant by a syllable in ⌊the perfectly  
good *jagatī* pāda⌋ **d**. For its use by Kāuś., with 2. 49, see under  
the latter; ⌊and especially my note to i. 49⌋. ⌊The verse is discussed  
by Hillebrandt, *Ved. Mythol.* i. 491.⌋
