### Translation
18. They anoint, they anoint out (*ví*), they anoint together (*sám*);  
they lick the rite (? *krátu*), they smear (*abhi-añj*) with honey; the  
bull (*ukṣán*) flying in the upheaving of the river, the victim (*paśú*)  
do the gold-purifiers seize (*gṛh*) in them ⌊f.⌋.

### Notes
The verse is RV. ix. 86. 43, the only variant in which is *gṛbhṇate* at  
the end (and our I. also has this; also the comm.). SV. (i. 564; ii.  
964) has it also and agrees with RV. in this word, but also has before  
it *apsú* instead of *āsu*, and in **b** *mádhvā*. The comm. understands  
*sthālīṣu* to be intended by the pronoun *āsu*. The verse is one of the  
wild utterances of the soma-purifiers in RV., and seems to be introduced  
here without any proper connection with the funeral ceremonies, simply  
because there is so much "anoint" in it. In Kāuś. (88. 16), it  
accompanies an anointing in the *piṇḍapitṛyajña;* and in Vāit. (10. 4),  
a smearing of the sacrificial post with butter in the *paśubandha*.  
⌊Pādas **b, c, d** are good *jagatī:* but **a** has no *jagatī*  
character whatever, and by count it is *virāj* rather than *bhurij;* but  
perhaps the Anukr. (see note to the excerpts from Anukr.) does not mean  
to call it *bhurij*.

They balm him, balm him over, balm him thoroughly, caress the mighty power and balm it with the mead, They seize the flying steer at the stream's breathing-place: cleansing with gold they grasp the animal herein.
