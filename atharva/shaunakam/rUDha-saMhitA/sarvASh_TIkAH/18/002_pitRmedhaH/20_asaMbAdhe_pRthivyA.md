### Translation
20. In the unoppressive wide space (*loká*) of earth be thou deposited;  
what *svadhā́s* thou didst make when living, be they dripping with honey  
for thee.

### Notes
Most of the *pada*-texts (except our Op. and one of SPP's) read *svadhā́*  
instead of *svadhā́ḥ* in **c**. ⌊SPP. gives as *pada*-reading *svadhā́ḥ*,  
and so the comm. interprets.⌋ At end of **c**, the authorities are  
bothered by a confusion of *jī́van* and *jīvám*. The *pada*-mss. read  
*jīván* (two of SPP's ⌊P. and P.², which are unaccented in this book⌋  
have *jīvan*): the *saṁhitā*-mss. have either *jīváṅs t-* (most of our  
mss.), or else *jīváṁ t-* (our O. and most of SPP's authorities), or  
else *jīvā́n t-* (one or two of SPP's). SPP. reads in his text *jī́van  
t-*, and says "the emendation is mine," not noticing that we had made it  
(the necessity of it being perfectly obvious) before him. The comm.,  
too, has *jīvan*. The comm., with four or two of SPP's mss., makes the  
common blunder of reading at the end *-ścyutaḥ*. In Kāuś. (82. 21) the  
second half-verse is quoted in full to accompany the pouring a  
pot-offering into the fire on the second day after cremation (here, too,  
only one ms. reads *jīvaṅs t-*, and most of the rest *jīvaṁ t-*).

In the free amplitude of earth take roomy space to lodge thee in. Let all oblations which in life thou paidest drop thee honey now.
