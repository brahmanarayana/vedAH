### Translation
6. With the *trikadrukas* it purifies itself; six wide ones, verily one  
great one; *triṣṭúbh*, *gāyatrī́*, the meters: all those \[are\] set in  
Yama.

### Notes
RV. x. 14. 16, the corresponding verse, has in **a** *patati*, and at  
the end *ā́hitā;* TA, (in vi. 5. 3) agrees with it, but transposes  
*triṣṭúbh* and *gāyatrī́* in **c**. The sense of the verse is wholly  
obscure. According to our comm., the *trikadrukas* are the *jyotiṣṭoma*,  
*goṣṭoma*, and *āyuṣṭoma;* the "six wide ones" (f.) are heaven and earth  
and day and night and waters and herbs; "the great one" (n.) is taken  
⌊alternatively⌋ as applying to Yama (m.): *mahāntāṁ yamam uddiśyāi ’va  
pravartante!* The commentator's ignorance is as great as our own; only  
he has no mind to acknowledge it. ⌊Hillebrandt cites passages akin with  
this, *Ved. Mythol.* i. 500.⌋

With the three jars Brihat alone makes pure the six wide-spread- ing realms. The Gayatri, the Trishtup, all metres in Yama are contained.
