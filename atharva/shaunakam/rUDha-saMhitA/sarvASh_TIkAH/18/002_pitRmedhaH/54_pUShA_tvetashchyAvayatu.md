### Translation
54. Let Pūshan, knowing, urge thee forth from here—he, the shepherd of  
creation (*bhúvana*) who loses no cattle; may he commit thee to those  
Fathers, \[and\] Agni to the beneficent gods.

### Notes
The RV. has a corresponding verse (x. 17. 3), without variant. TA. (in  
vi. 1. i) has in **c** *dadāt* (as has our comm.), and at the end  
*suvidátrebhyas*. The mss. are somewhat equally divided in **c-d**  
between *-bhyo ‘gnír* and *-bhyo agnír;* our text adopts the latter;  
SPP., better, the former, with RV. and TA.

Guard of the world, whose cattle ne'er are injured, may Pushan bear thee hence, for he hath knowledge. May he consign thee to these Fathers' keeping, and to the gracious Gods let Agni give hee.
