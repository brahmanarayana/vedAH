### Translation
33. They hid away the immortal one (f.) from mortals; having made one of  
like color, they gave her to Vivasvant; what that was carried also the  
two Aśvins; and Saraṇyū deserted two twins.

### Notes
Whether 'two pairs of twins' is meant is not altogether certain; but  
that would be strictly *dvé mithuné;* ⌊but see BR. v. 777, line 3⌋. The  
verb *abharat* does not mean 'bore,' in the sense of 'gave birth to,'  
though it might mean 'carried \[in her womb\],' and so might have a  
nearly equivalent value; our comm. renders it by *samabharat* or  
*udapādayat*. The third pāda means 'that substitute, whatever it really  
was,' though the usual version "when that was" (for *yát tád ā́sīt*) is  
not altogether impossible. The verse is RV. x. 17. 2, which differs only  
by reading in **b** *kṛtvī́* and *adadus* (for which our *-dhus* is a  
common corruption). It is properly inseparable from 1. 53 above; ⌊for  
bibliographical references, see under that vs.⌋. Kāuś. and Vāit. pass it  
unused, as they did 1. 53. ⌊The comm., with one or two of SPP's mss.,  
reads *amṛtān* in **a**.⌋

From mortal men they hid the immortal Lady, made one like her and gave her to Vivasvan. Saranyu brought to him the Asvin brothers, and then deserted both twinned pairs of children.
