### Translation
57. This garment hath now come first to thee; remove (*apa-ūh*) that one  
which thou didst wear here before; knowing, do thou follow along with  
what is offered and bestowed, where it is given thee variously among  
them of various connection (? *víbandhu*).

### Notes
TK. (in vi. 1. 1) has a corresponding verse, but with sundry variants:  
at the beginning, *idáṁ* (which is better) *tvā vástram;* in **c, d**,  
*ánu sám paśya dákṣiṇāṁ yáthā te*. *Te dattám* is perhaps better 'given  
by thee'—thy former deeds of religion and charity, now to be enjoyed in  
their fruit; and *víbandhu* 'to those not thine own connections.' The  
Pet. Lexx. explain *víbandhuṣu* as 'destitute of connections or  
relatives.' The comm., with its customary regardlessness of accent,  
understands the word as two words, *vi bandhuṣu*, and connects *vi* (=  
*viśeṣeṇa*) with *dattam*. According to Kāuś. 80. 17, the verse is used,  
with 4. 31, in connection with dressing the body for cremation; in 81.  
29, some of the mss. substitute it for vs. 22 above. Some of the schol.  
(note to Kāuś. 80. 52) use it and 4. 31 when the body is laid on the  
funeral pile. The verse, as a *triṣṭubh*, is rather *svarāj* than  
*bhurij* (11 + 12: 11 + 12 = 46).
