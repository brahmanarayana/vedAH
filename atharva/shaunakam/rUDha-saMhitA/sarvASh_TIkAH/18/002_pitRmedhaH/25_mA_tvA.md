### Translation
25. Let not the tree oppress thee, nor the great divine earth; having  
found a place (*loká*) among the Fathers, thrive (*edh*) thou among  
those whose king is Yama.

### Notes
Only about half the mss. have at the end the true reading *yamárājasu*  
(which both editions give, as was proper); some of our *saṁhitā*-nss.  
(P.M.T.) accent *yamarā́jasu*, and most of the *pada*-mss. have  
correspondingly, as two independent words, *yama: rā́ja॰su* (namely  
Bp.D.Kp., and two of SPP's); one (I.) has *yamárā́j-*. One or two  
(including our O.) give *bādhiṣṭhe* in **a**. TA. (in vi. 7. 2) has two  
corresponding verses: *mā́ tvā vṛkṣāú sám bādhiṣṭām mā́ mātā́ pṛthivi tvám:  
pitṝ́n hy átra gácchāsy édhāsaṁ yamarā́jye*, and *mā́ tvā vṛkṣāú sám  
bādhethām mā́ mātā́ pṛthivī́ mahī́: vāivasvatáṁ hí gácchāsi yamarā́jye ví  
rājasi:* both are partly corrupt. According to Kāuś. (82. 32), the verse  
accompanies the deposit of the collected bone-relics "at the root of a  
tree." ⌊Baunack, ZDMG. l. 281, 284, understands *vánaspáti* at RV. v.  
78. 5 and AV. xviii. 3. 70, as meaning, like *vṛkṣá* here, a tree used  
after the manner of a coffin. Curiously enough, *peṭikā* (Sāyaṇa's gloss  
for *vanaspati*) usually means  
  
κόφινος.⌋ ⌊For consistency, the Berlin ed. should read *vittvāí-*.⌋

Let not a tree oppness thee, nor Earth the great Goddess weigh thee down. Among the Fathers find thy home, and thrive mid those whom Yama rules.
