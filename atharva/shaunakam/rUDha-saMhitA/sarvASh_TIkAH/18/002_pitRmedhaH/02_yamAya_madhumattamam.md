### Translation
2. Offer ye to Yama what is most honeyed, and stand forth; this homage  
to the former-born, the former, the path-making seers.

### Notes
This verse and the next correspond to RV. x. 14. 15 and 14, save that  
RV. makes our 2 **b** and 3 **b** change places\* and they become  
respectively its 14 **b** and 15 **b**, the double inversion thus  
leaving our 2 **b** and 3 **b** in the same relative position in both  
texts. TA. (in vi. 5. l) agrees throughout with RV., both in this verse  
and the next. Our 2 **b** agrees also with RV. i. 15. 9 **b**. But RV.  
in both places has, like TA., *juhóta* for our *juhótā*.  
  
\*⌊The case is interesting as showing how easily the component elements  
of many of these verses may be shuffled about without detriment to what  
we may, out of politeness to the Rishis, call the "sequence of thought."  
The result of the transpositions is best shown by parallel columns,  
thus:

Roth has beautifully illustrated the matter by shuffling together verses  
from Schiller's Riddles ("Von Perlen baut sich eine Brücke" and "Es  
steht ein gross' geräumig Haus"): see ZDMG. xxxvii. 109.—Cf. notes to  
xviii. 2. 35; 3. 47.⌋

Offer to Yama sacrifice most sweet in savour and draw near. Bow down before the Rishis of the olden time, the ancient ones who made the path.
