### Translation
3. Unto Yama the king offer ye an oblation, milk rich in ghee; he  
furnishes (*ā-yam*) to us among the living a long life-time, for living  
on.

### Notes
The verse is RV. x. 14. 14 (found also in TA. vi. 5. 1), except that  
**b** is 15 **b**: ⌊see note to the preceding verse⌋. ⌊TA. agrees with  
RV.⌋ For *páyas* in **a**, RV. reads *havís;* for *havís* in **b**,  
*havyám;* and in **c, d**, it has *devéṣv ā́ yamad dīr-*. SPP. reads in  
**c-d** *yamed dīr-* ⌊so also Caland, *Todtengebräuche*, note 243⌋,  
which is certainly better than *yame dīr-*: half his authorities give  
the former; but of our mss. only Op. has *yamet*, while D. has *yamat*,  
like RV. ⌊TA. and the comm.⌋. ⌊The case is strikingly like that of  
*mānaye tathā*, *mānayet tathā*, at xv. 10. 2.⌋—The Prāt. (ii. 76)  
distinctly requires *ā́yuṣ prá* to be read in **d**, but of our mss. only  
O.s.m. (in margin) gives it; nearly half of SPP's *saṁhitā*-mss.,  
however, have it, and it ought to be received as the true AV. text,  
though both editions read *ā́yuḥ*. These three verses make no appearance  
in Kāuś. ⌊This last statement now appears to be wrong: see note to vs.  
1.⌋  
  
⌊Considering the exaggerated nicety of the theory of the Hindus  
respecting consonant groups (cf. Whitney, AV. Prāt., p. 584-90), and in  
particular their doctrine of the *varṇakrama* ("At the end of a word, a  
consonant is pronounced double," *padānte vyañjanaṁ dviḥ*, Prāt. iii.  
26), it is strange that the mss. sometimes fail to come up even to the  
simple requirements of orthography as set by grammar and sense. On the  
other hand, it can hardly be said that the mss. in the cases of these  
shortcomings are a less truthful representation of the actual connected  
utterance of the text than would be for instance the graphical  
representation of the English *some more* by the words *some ore*.—I  
have thought it worth while to assemble a few notable cases where the  
one of two needed double letters is omitted. Thus besides *yame\[d\]  
dīrghám* and *mānaye\[t\] táthā*, just mentioned, we have: at xviii. 3.  
3, *jīvā́m \[m\]ṛtébhyas* (a most striking example: there is abundant ms.  
authority for the false *ṛtébhyas*, which is yet shown beyond all  
peradventure to be a blunder by the *mṛtā́ya jīvā́m* of TA.); at xviii. 4.  
40, *juṣantām*
