### Translation
19. Be pleasant to him, O earth, a thornless resting-place; furnish him  
broad refuge.

### Notes
RV. has a corresponding verse (i. 22. 15), but reads for **a** *syonā́  
pṛthivi bhava;* and in **c** it reads *nas* for *asmāi*, and *sapráthas*  
for *-thās* ⌊see my *Noun-Inflection*, p. 560⌋; VS. (xxxv. 21) has  
nearly the same, but inserts *nas* after *pṛthivi*, and ends with  
*-thās*, like our text; MB. (ii. 2. 7) agrees with VS. except in having  
*-thas*, like RV.; it also adds a fourth pāda. ⌊MP. ii. 15. 2 agrees  
with RV. save that it combines *naś śárma* and ends with *-thās*. Cf.  
the *pratīka* in MGS. i. 10. 5, and the Index, p. 158.⌋ The comm.  
explains *anṛkṣarā* by *anādhikā*. In Kāuś. (80. 3) this verse  
(according to the comm., vss. 19-21) is to be used when the man  
threatened with death is laid on the floor on *darbha*-grass; and again  
(80. 38), when the dead body is taken down from the cart at the funeral  
pile; and once more (82. 33), when the jar containing the bones is  
deposited in (or on) the earth. In Vāit. 37. 25, vss. 19 and 20  
accompany the knocking-down of the animal-victim in the *puruṣamedha*  
sacrifice.
