### Translation
5. When thou shalt make him done, O Jātavedas, then commit him to the  
Fathers; when he shall go to that other life (*ásunīti*), then shall he  
become a controller (? *vaśanī́*) of the gods.

### Notes
The verse is RV. x. 16. 2, but RV. makes our 5 **a** and 4 **c** change  
places: see note to vs. 4. RV. has *yadā́* ⌊for our *yadó* = *yadā́ u*⌋ at  
beginning of **c**, and *áthā* at beginning of **d**. TA. (in vi. 1. 4)  
agrees throughout with RV. save in accenting *karási* in **a**. Both, of  
course, read *áthe ”m enam* in **b**; but this time the AV. mss. are as  
good as unanimous in the corruption of *īm* to *imám*, and both the  
published texts are compelled to read it; the Anukr., too, seems to  
ratify it, by calling the verse *bhurij;* the comm. has instead *idam*,  
and one or two of SPP's authorities follow it. The comm. explains  
*asunīti* by *asūn prāṇān nayati lokāntaram*, and hence *prāṇāpahartrī  
devatā;* and *devānām* by *svakīyānām indriyāṇām;* while *vaśanīs* is  
(*cakṣurādīndriyāṇāṁ*) *sūryādidevatāprāpakaḥ!* ⌊Weber deems the idea of  
getting the gods under your control to be an indication of lateness or  
possibly of Buddhistic influence: *Sb.* 1895, p. 845, and 1897, p. 597.⌋

When thou hast made him ready, Jatavedas, then do thou give him over to the Fathers. When he attains unto the life that waits him he will obey the Deities' commandment.
