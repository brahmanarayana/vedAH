### Translation
37. I give this release to him who hath thus come and hath become mine  
here—thus replies the knowing Yama—let this one approach (*upa-sthā*) my  
wealth here.

### Notes
The translation implies that *rāyá* before *úpa* in **d** means *rāyás*  
(accus. pl.), and not *rāyé* as understood by the *pada*-text; the comm.  
understands *rāyas*. Also, that *céd* in **b** admits of being taken as  
*ca íd* ⌊the *pada*-text always reads *ca: ít*, even when the meaning is  
'if'⌋ with individual meaning, and not as the compound particle, = 'if.'  
⌊There is a gap in the commentary just after the explanation of *etat:*  
but the commentator's text of the AV.⌋ reads *yát* for *yás* at  
beginning of **b**. For the Kāuś. use of the verse with 1. 55, see under  
the latter. This verse also accompanies (with 3. 73: Kāuś. 85. 24) the  
deposition of the bones in the hole in the ceremony of interment.

I give this place to him who hath come hither and now is mine, to be a home to rest in: This was the thought of Yama when he answered: This man is. mine. Let him come here to riches.
