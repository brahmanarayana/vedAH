### Translation
16. They who by fervor are unassailable, who by fervor have gone to  
heaven (*svàr*), who made fervor their greatness, unto them do thou go.

### Notes
The corresponding RV. verse (x. 154. 2) has no variant; in TA. (vi. 3.  
2), however, we find *gatā́s* for *yayús* in **b**, and *mahát* for  
*máhas* in **c**: this latter reading the comm. appears to have in mind  
when he explains *mahas* as signifying *mahat*.
