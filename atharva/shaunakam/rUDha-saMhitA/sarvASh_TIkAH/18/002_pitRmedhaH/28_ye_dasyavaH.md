### Translation
28. What barbarians (*dásyu*), having entered among the Fathers, having  
faces of acquaintances, go about, eating what is not sacrificed, who  
bear *parāpúr* \[and\] *nipúr*—Agni shall blast (*dham*) them forth from  
this sacrifice.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Similar verses are found in VS. (ii. 30), (śśS. (iv. 4. 2), AśS. (ii. 6.  
2), MB. (ii. 3. 4), and Āp. (three varying versions at i. 8. 7). Āp. has  
in its first version for **a, b** *apa yantv asurāḥ pitṛrūpā ye rūpāṇi  
pratimucyā ”caranti*, a close analogue to our first half-verse; the rest  
⌊including of Āp. only the second version⌋ have, without variant, *yé  
rūpā́ṇi pratimuñcámānā ásurāḥ sántaḥ svadháyā cáranti*, which is not  
quite so near. ⌊The third version in Āp. is *ye jñātīnām pratirūpāḥ  
pitṝn māyayā ’surāḥ praviṣṭāḥ.*⌋ In **c** all the texts ⌊including the  
three versions in Āp.⌋ agree with ours. For **d**, all the texts  
⌊including the first two versions in Āp.⌋ have *agníṣ ṭā́ṅ lokā́t prá  
ṇudāty* (AśS. *-dātv*, MB. *-datv*) *asmā́t;* ⌊while the third version in  
Āp. reads *agne tān asmāt praṇudasva lokāt*⌋. The comm. to VS. explains  
*parāpúras* as *sthūladehān* and *nipúras* as *sūkṣmadehān*, which is,  
of course, the purest nonsense; that to MB. divides *parā puro ni puro  
ye bharanti*, and connects the prepositions with the verb, rendering the  
first *puras* by "our enemies' houses" and the second by "our kindred's  
houses"—quite as bad. Our comm., finally, explains *parāpúras* (through  
*parā pṛṇanti*) as *piṇḍadātāraḥ putrāḥ*, and *nipúras* (through  
*nipṛṇanti* ⌊cf. his remark about *ni-pṛ* reported at the end of note to  
vs. 30⌋) as *pāutrāḥ*—if possible, worse than either of the others. All  
we can see clearly is that the native exegetes are quite as much in the  
dark as we with regard to the value of these obscure words. Except O.R.,  
all our mss. have the false accent *dasyávas* in **a**; of SPP's, only  
two do so. Of the mss. in our hands at the time of printing of the text,  
only I. accented *jñātimukhās* at all (two of SPP's also leave it  
accentless), and we accordingly emended to *jñātímukhās*, according to  
the usual rule for such a compound; but I.O.Op.R.K., with the majority  
of SPP's authorities, read *jñātimukhā́s*, which SPP. has therefore  
properly adopted in his edition. By Kāuś. (87. 30) the verse is  
prescribed to be repeated while a lighted brand is carried three times  
about and then flung away.

Those Dasyus who, not eating our oblations, come wilh friends' faces mingled with the Fathers, Those who wear gross those who wear subtile bodies,--from this. our sacrifice let Agni blast them.
