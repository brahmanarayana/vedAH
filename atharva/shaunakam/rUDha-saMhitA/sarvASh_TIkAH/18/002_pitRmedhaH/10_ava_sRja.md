### Translation
10. Release again, O Agni, to the Fathers him who goes (*car*) offered  
to thee, with *svadhā́;* clothing himself in life (*ā́yus*), let him go  
unto \[his\] posterity (? *śéṣas*); let him be united with a body, very  
splendid.

### Notes
The corresponding verse in RV. (x. 16. 5) reads at end of **b**  
*svadhā́bhis*, in **c** *vetu* for *yātu*, and at end *jātavedaḥ* (for  
*suvárcāḥ*); TA. (in vi. 4. 2) also has *svadhā́bhis* and *jātavedas*,  
but in **c** gives *úpa yātu śéṣam*. ⌊The last pāda, **d**, recurs below  
at 3. 58.⌋ The third pāda is of doubtful meaning, but perhaps relates to  
the return of the deceased, after due installation among the Manes, to  
receive the ancestral offerings. The comm. explains *śéṣas* ⌊which he  
takes as *śeṣa-s*, masc.⌋ simply as *apatyanāman*. ⌊Kāuś. 81. 44 excepts  
this verse from the sequence of 14 *anuṣṭhānī* versts (4-18): see under  
vs. 4.⌋ In Kāuś. (82. 28) the verse is used in the ceremonies of the  
third day after cremation, in connection with sprinkling and collecting  
the bones. The Anukr. takes no notice of the deficiency of a syllable in  
**d**. ⌊As to *śeṣas*, see my note on this vs., *Reader*, p. 379-380:  
W's interpretation seems to me much better than either of those there  
noted.⌋

Away O Agni, to the Fathers, send him who, offered in thee, goes with our oblations. Wearing new life let him approach his offspring, and splendid, be invested with a body,
