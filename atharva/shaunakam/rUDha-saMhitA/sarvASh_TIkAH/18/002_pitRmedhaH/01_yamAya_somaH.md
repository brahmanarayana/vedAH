### Translation
1. For Yama the soma purifies itself; for Yama is made the oblation; to  
Yama goes the sacrifice, messengered by Agni, made satisfactory.

### Notes
The verse corresponds to RV. x. 14. 13, which, however, in **a** reads  
*sómaṁ sunuta*, and in **b** *juhutā* (for *kriyate*). TA. (vi. 5. 1)  
agrees with RV. in both points, but has *gachatu* in **c**. The comm.  
reads at the end *alaṁkṛtas*.  
  
⌊Verses 1, 2, and 3 of this hymn are used (Kāuś. 81. 36) in one  
continuous sequence with the last four of the preceding hymn (*iti  
saṁhitāḥ sapta!*), to accompany the oblations to Yama in the cremation  
ceremony: for details, see my note to xviii. 1. 49.⌋

For Yama Soma juice flows clear, to Yama is oblation paid. To Yama sacrifice prepared, and heralded by Agni, goes.
