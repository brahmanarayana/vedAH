### Translation
51. This time, verily; not further; in old age another further than  
this; as a wife her husband with her garment, do thou cover him, O earth  
(*bhū́mi*).

### Notes
The first half-verse is very obscure, and the second pāda perhaps  
corrupt. The comm. takes *jarási* with the first pāda, and explains that  
"what food etc. has been enjoyed in old age, this verily, left over, not  
anything else \[further\], is to be enjoyed"; and then "than this place  
of interment, any other place is not found for him"; all of which is  
simply silly. The Anukr. pays no attention to the redundant syllable  
(unless we pronounce *patim ‘va*) in **c**.
