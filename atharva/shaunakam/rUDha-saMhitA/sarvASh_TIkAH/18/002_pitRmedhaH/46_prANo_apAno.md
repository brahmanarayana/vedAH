### Translation
46. Breath, expiration, through-breathing (*vyāná*), life-time, an eye  
to see the sun: by a road not beset with enemies (*-pára*) go thou to  
the Fathers whose king is Yama.

### Notes
The comm. explains: *mukhanāsikābhyām bahir niḥsaran vāyuḥ prāṇaḥ:  
antargacchann apānaḥ; madhyasthaḥ sann aśitapītādikaṁ vividham āniti  
kṛtsnadehaṁ vyāpayatī ’ti vyānaḥ*. It foolishly understands *yamárājñas*  
in **d** as gen. sing.: (the road) "of king Yama." The Pet. Lexx. render  
*áparipara* by 'not roundabout,' as if the final *para* were somehow  
also a *pari;* the comm. understands the word nearly as above  
translated; ⌊and the translation is supported by VS. iv. 34⌋. The Prāt.  
(iv. 39 c) notes the division *vi॰ānáḥ* *pada*-text, while *prāṇá* and  
*apāná* are always undivided.
