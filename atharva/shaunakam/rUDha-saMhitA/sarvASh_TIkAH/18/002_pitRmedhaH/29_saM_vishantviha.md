### Translation
29. Let there enter together (*sam-viś*) here our own Fathers, doing  
what is pleasant, lengthening \[our\] life-time; may we be able to reach  
them with oblation, living long for numerous autumns.

### Notes
The translation implies in **a** the *pada*-reading *svā́ḥ: naḥ*, which  
SPP. gives by emendation, all the *pada*-mss. save Bp. (which has *svā́:  
naḥ*) having *svā́naḥ;* again, it implies in **b** *pra॰tirántaḥ*, while  
all read *pra॰tiránte* ⌊or *-ate*⌋; here also SPP. emends to *-ntaḥ*.  
The comm. reads *-nte*, and glosses it by *pravardhayantu!* ⌊A similar  
uncertainty (as between the Vulgate and Ppp.) concerning the  
understanding of the combination *pratiranta āyuḥ* was noted by me under  
xiv. 2. 36.⌋ The verse is used, according to Kāuś. (83. 29), next after  
the use of 1. 52, in arranging the bones for burial; and it is repeated,  
like the latter, in the *piṇḍapitṛyajña* (87. 28); *sam-viś*, as here  
applied, perhaps has its secondary sense of 'turn in, lie down.' The  
comm. reads *dakṣamāṇās* in **c**, explaining it by *vardhamānās*. The  
Anukr. does not notice the redundant syllable in **c** ⌊or perhaps  
assumes a deficiency in **d** to balance it. The word *nakṣ-* demands an  
accusative: so that both meter and syntax combine to cast suspicion on  
*tebhyas*⌋.

Bringing delight, prolonging our existence, here let our own, the Fathers, dwell together. Coming with sacrifice may we assist them, living long lives through many autumn seasons.
