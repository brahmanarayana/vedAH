### Translation
22. Let the water-carrying, water-floating Maruts carry thee up, making  
\[thee\] cool by the goat, let them sprinkle \[thee\] with rain, splash!

### Notes
Some of the authorities (our O.Op.R.D., and near half of SPP's, with the  
comm.) have in **b** *udaplútas*. For the use of the verse by Kāuś., see  
under vs. 8 above. ⌊Cf. the use of *bā́l* in i. 3. 1.⌋

Floating in water, bringing streams, let Maruts carry thee aloft, And causing coolness by their rush sprinkle thee with their fall- ing rain.
