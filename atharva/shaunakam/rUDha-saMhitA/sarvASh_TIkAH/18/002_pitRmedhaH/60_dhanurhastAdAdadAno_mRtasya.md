### Translation
60. Taking the bow from the hand of the dead man, together with  
authority (*kṣatrá*), splendor, strength—take thou hold upon much  
prosperous good; come thou hitherward unto the world of the living.

### Notes
The two verses together correspond to RV. x. 18. 9, our 60 **a, b** most  
nearly to 9 **a, b**, and our 59 **c, d** to 9 **c, d**. But RV. has for  
its **b** *asmé kṣatrā́ya várcase bálāya*, and in its **d** *spṛ́dhas* for  
*mṛ́dhas*. TA. (in vi. 1. 3) has three verses, with **a-b** respectively  
as follows: *suvárṇaṁ hástād ādádānā mṛtásya śriyāí bráhmaṇe téjase  
bálāya; dhánur hástād ādádānā mṛtásya śriyāí kṣatrā́yāú ’jase bálāya;*  
and *máṇiṁ hástād ādádānā mṛtásya śriyāí viśé púṣṭyāi bálāya;* their  
common second half agrees with RV. except in having *suśévās* for  
*suvī́rās;* they are addressed to Brahman, Kshatriya and Vāiśya  
respectively, as our two are addressed to Brahman and Kshatriya, and  
that of RV. to Kshatriya only. 'Hearing' in our 59 **b** has a special  
meaning, the hearing or inspired reception of the sacred word ⌊cf. i. 1.  
2, and note⌋. Kāuś. 80. 48, 49 explains the two verses as uttered while  
staff or bow is taken from the dead hand, as the body lies on the pile  
ready for cremation; and 80. 50 implies a third verse addressed to a  
Vāiśya, on taking from him a goad (*aṣṭrām*). Our 60 **c, d** is  
evidently addressed to the person (the son) who removes the article. The  
comm. reads in 59 **c** (with TA.) *suśevās*.  
  
⌊Here ends the second *anuvāka*, with 1 hymn and 60 verses. The quoted  
Anukr. says *ṣaṣṭiś ca:* cf. page 814, ¶5.⌋  
  
⌊Here ends also the thirty-third *prapāṭhaka*.⌋
