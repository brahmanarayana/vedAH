### Translation
44. This measure do we measure together, so that etc. etc.

### Notes
The comm. regards all these *paryāya*-variations of vs. 38 as to be used  
with it where it is prescribed; the Kāuś. says nothing of this. The  
comm. also gives artificial and absurd interpretations of the altered  
prepositions at the beginnings of the verses. ⌊Some of the alterations  
spoil the meter (p. 830, ¶4).⌋
