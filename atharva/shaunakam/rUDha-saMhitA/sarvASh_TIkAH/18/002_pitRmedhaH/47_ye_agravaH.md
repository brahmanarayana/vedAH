### Translation
47. They that departed unmarried \[but\] assiduous, abandoning hatreds,  
having no progeny—they, going up to heaven (*div*), have found a place  
(*loká*), ⌊they,⌋ shining (? *dī́dhyāna*) upon the back of the firmament.

### Notes
The comm. commits the absurdity of glossing *agru* by *agragāmin*, and  
*śaśamāná* ('assiduous': i.e. having faithfully performed their  
religious duties) by *śaṅsamāna* or else (from root *śaś* 'leap')  
*plutagamanaśīla!* It seems hardly possible to avoid taking *dīdhyāna*  
in **d** as meant for *dīdyāna;* the comm. renders by *dīpyamāna*. The  
mss. vary between *agrávas* and *ágravas*, none of ours that were  
collated before publication having the latter, which is the true accent  
⌊correct the Berlin ed.⌋, and is adopted by SPP. on the authority of a  
majority of his authorities (with which our O.Op.R.T. agree).

Unmarried men who toiled and have departed, the childless, having left their foes behind them, Have found on high the world whereto they mounted, reflecting on the ridge of vaulted heaven.
