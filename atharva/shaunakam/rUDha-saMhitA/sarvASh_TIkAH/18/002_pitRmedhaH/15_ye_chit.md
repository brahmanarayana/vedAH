### Translation
15. They who of old were won by right, born of right, increasers of  
right—to the seers rich in fervor (*tápas-*), born of fervor, O Yama, do  
thou go.

### Notes
The corresponding RV. verse (x. 154. 4) reads in **a, b** *pū́rva ṛtasā́pa  
ṛtā́vānaḥ* in **c** *pitṝ́n*, in **d** *tā́ṅś cid evá* (as in our vss. 14,  
16, 17). The comm. explains *yama* here to mean *yamavan niyata*, or  
*yamena nīyamāna preta*, which is probably not far from correct; it is  
the deceased person who is addressed.
