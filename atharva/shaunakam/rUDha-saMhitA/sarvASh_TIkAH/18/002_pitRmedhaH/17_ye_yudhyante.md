### Translation
17. They who fight in the contests (*pradhána*), who are  
self-sacrificing (*tanūtyáj*) heroes, or who give thousand-fold  
sacrificial gifts, unto them do thou go.

### Notes
The corresponding RV. verse (x. 154. 3) has no variant; TA. (in vi. 3.  
2) has *tanuty* in **b**. Ppp. has the verse, in book xx., and reads for  
**c**, *tās tvaṁ sahasradakṣiṇāḥ*, and in **d** *gachatām*.

The heroes who contend in war and boldly cast their lives away. Or who give guerdon thousandfold,--even to those let him depart.
