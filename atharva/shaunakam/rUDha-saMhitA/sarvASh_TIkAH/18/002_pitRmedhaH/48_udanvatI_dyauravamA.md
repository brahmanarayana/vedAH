### Translation
48. Watery is the lowest heaven (*dív*), full of stars (? *pīlu-*) is  
called the midmost; the third is called the fore-heaven (*pradív*), in  
which the Fathers sit.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Rather than leave *pīlu-* in **b** untranslated, we set in our version  
the comm's worthless etymological guess (*pālayantī ’ti pīlavaḥ:  
grahanakṣatrādayaḥ*). SPP. has at the beginning the better accent  
*udanvátī*, as read by half his autliorities (and by our O.Op.R. among  
those collated after publication). Our Bp.D. accent also *pīlumatī́;* O.  
reads *pītúmatī*, doubtless an accidental blunder, yet suggesting the  
emendation *pitumátī* 'rich in nourishment.' For the use of the verse  
prescribed by Kāuś., see under 1. 61; the comm. says simply that with  
this verse and another one (*iti dvābhyām*) the body is raised in order  
to being laid on the cart or litter (for transportation to the funeral  
pile); a schol. (note to Kāuś. 82. 31) uses it also in connection with  
the interment of the bone-relics.
