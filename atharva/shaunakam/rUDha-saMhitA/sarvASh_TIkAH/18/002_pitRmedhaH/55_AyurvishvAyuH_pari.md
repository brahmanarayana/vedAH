### Translation
55. May life-time, having all life-time, protect thee about; let Pūshan  
protect thee in front on the forward road; where sit the well-doers,  
whither they have gone, there let god Savitar set thee.

### Notes
RV., in the corresponding verse (x. 17. 4), reads *pāsati* in **a**, and  
*té yayús* at end of **c** ⌊thus rectifying the meter in both places⌋;  
and TA. (in vi. 1. 2) agrees with it both times; the comm. also has  
*pāsati*. The verse is metrically irregular (10 + 11: 12 + 11 = 44);  
⌊but perfectly good in its RV. form (11 + 11: 12 + 11)⌋.

Lord of all life, let Ayu guard thee, Pushan convey thee forward on the distant pathway. May Savitar the God conduct thee thither where dwell the pious who have gone before thee.
