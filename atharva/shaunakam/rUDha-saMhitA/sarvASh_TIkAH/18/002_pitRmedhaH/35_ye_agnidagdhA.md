### Translation
35. They who, burned with fire, \[and\] who, not burned with fire, revel  
on *svadhā́* in the midst of heaven—them thou knowest, if thine, O  
Jātavedas; let them enjoy with *svadhā́* the sacrifice, the *svádhiti*.

### Notes
The verse corresponds to RV. x. 15. 14 **a, b** and 13 **c, d** (and to  
VS. xix. 60 **a, b** and 67 **c, d**). In the first half, AV. and RV.  
agree (two of our mss., O.R., combine *yé ‘nag-*); VS. has *-ṣvāttās*  
both times for *-dagdhās*. For **c**, RV. and VS. read *tváṁ vettha yáti  
té jāt-* 'thou knowest how many they are,' and of this our text is  
doubtless a corruption. Nearly half the mss. have *te* (both editions,  
with the remaining mss., including our O.R.T.K., *té*); the translation  
implies *te*. HGS. (ii. 11. 1) has *agne tān vettha yadi te jātavedaḥ*.  
For **d**, RV. and VS. have *svadhā́bhir yajñáṁ súkṛtaṁ juṣasva;* and  
here again our text seems only a corruption; *svádhitim* (p.  
*svá॰dhitim*) must be meant as *nomen actionis* to *svadhā́*, I think, =  
'the giving of *svadhā́*'—a false formation. The comm. reads *svadhāyās*  
and *svadhitam*, explaining the latter as *svadhā saṁjātā yasya*.  
According to the comm., this verse and the preceding are used in the  
*piṇḍapitṛyajña* "on laying two pieces of fuel."

Those, whether flames have burnt or not consumed them, who in the midst of heaven enjoy oblations-- Let them, when thou dost know them, Jatavedas, accept with sacred food the axe and worship.
