### Translation
21. I call thy mind hither with mind; come unto these houses, enjoying  
\[them\]; unite thyself with the Fathers, with Yama; let pleasant,  
helpful (? *śagmá*) winds blow thee unto \[them\].

### Notes
Excepting K., all our mss. read *imā́m* (or *imā́ṁ*) in **b**; SPP.  
records the reading as given only by two of his *pada*-mss. ⌊Pāda **c**  
is RV. x. 14. 8 **a**.⌋ The comm. glosses *śagmās* with *sukhakarās*.  
The Anukr. does not heed the redundant syllable in **b**.

Hither I call thy spirit with my spirit. Come thou; delighted, to these dwelling-places. Unite thee with the Fathers and with Yama: strong and delicious be the winds that fan thee.
