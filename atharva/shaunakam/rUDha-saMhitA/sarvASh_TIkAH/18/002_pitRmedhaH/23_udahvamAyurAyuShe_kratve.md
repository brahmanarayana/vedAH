### Translation
23. I have called up life-time unto life-time, unto ability (*krátu*),  
unto dexterity, unto life; let thy mind go to its own ⌊pl.⌋; then run  
unto the Fathers.

### Notes
The majority of our mss. (except Bs.s.m.R.Op.K. ⌊which have *svā́n*⌋; T.  
has *svāṁn*), and two of SPP's, read *svā́m* at beginning of **c**, as  
does also the comm., which supplies *tanum* for it to qualify. SPP.  
gives in **c-d** *máno ádhā*, and claims that all his authorities  
without exception read thus; our Bs. has *‘dhā*, and if any of the other  
*saṁhitā*-mss. ⌊except O., which has *máno ádhā*⌋ do not agree with  
this, I have failed to note it.

I have recalled thy life to life, to being, power, and energy. Let thy soul go unto its own: so to the Fathers hasten thou.
