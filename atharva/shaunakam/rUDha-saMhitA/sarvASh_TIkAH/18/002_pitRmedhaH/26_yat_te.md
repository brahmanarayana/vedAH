### Translation
26. What limb of thine is put over at a distance, and what expiration  
\[or\] breath has gone forth upon the wind (?), let the associated  
(*sánīḍa*) Fathers, assembling, make that enter thee again, bit  
(*ghāsá*) from bit.

### Notes
With the first half-verse is to be compared vii. 53. 3 **a, b**. All the  
saṁhitā-mss. in **b** accent *vā́te*, save one of SPP's, *sec. manu;* and  
all our *pada*-mss. divide *vā́: te*, as if, after all, they thought *vā:  
te* intended. SPP's *pada*-mss. also divide *vā́: te* (only one of them  
is accented); he adopts *vā te*, on the authority of the one altered ms.  
⌊\[and the comm.⌋. To me *vā́te* seems rather the preferable reading,  
though there is not much to choose between the two. Our O. and two or  
three of SPP's authorities give *páretāḥ* ⌊plural: but no *pada*-ms. has  
*yé* to correspond⌋. Several of our mss., and the decided majority of  
SPP's authorities (except the *pada*-authorities: which, as he fails to  
report them, presumably have *-ḍāḥ*) read *sánīḍād gh-*; but of our  
*pada*-mss., all but one ⌊Op.s.m.⌋ give *sá॰nīḍāḥ*, and this SPP. adopts  
in his text, as do we. The comm. has *sanīlās;* in **b**, he reads  
*ye...paretāḥ*. The use of the verse with vs. 24 in Kāuś. was stated  
under vs. 24.

Each parted member, severed from thy body, thy vital breaths that in the wind have vanished, With all of these, piece after piece, shall Fathers who dwell to- gether meet and reunite thee.
