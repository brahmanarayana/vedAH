### Translation
14. Soma purifies itself for some; some wait upon (*upa-ās*) ghee; for  
whom honey runs forward (?), unto them do thou go.

### Notes
The 'go' in these verses is *gachatāt*, imperative of remoter or after  
action. The translation implies restoration in **c** of the RV. (x. 154.  
1) reading *pradhā́vati*, of which our *pradhā́v* (p. *pra॰dhāú*) *ádhi*  
seems only a blundering and unintelligible corruption. Some of our mss.  
(and one of SPP's) accent *pradhā́vadhi*. The comm. agrees with RV., and  
SPP. is not to be blamed for adopting, though against all the  
authorities save the comm., *pradhā́vati* in his text. TA. (which has our  
vss. 14, 17, and 16 following immediately after our 11-13, little as the  
two sets appear to have to do with each other) reads (in vi. 3. 2) with  
RV.

For some the Soma juice runs clear some sit by sacrificial oil. To those for whom the meath flows forth, even to those let him depart.
