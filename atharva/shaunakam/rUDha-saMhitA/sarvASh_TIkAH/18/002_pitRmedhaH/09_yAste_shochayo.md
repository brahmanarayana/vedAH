### Translation
9. What ardors (*śocí*), swiftnesses (*ráṅhi*) are thine, O Jātavedas,  
with which thou fillest the sky, the atmosphere, let them collect  
(*sam-ṛ*) after the goat as he goes; then with other most propitious  
ones make him propitious.

### Notes
With the first half-verse is to be compared xiii. 1. 9 **a, b**. SPP.  
reads in **d** *śṛtám* for *śivám*, with the decided majority of his  
authorities; of our mss., only O.Op.R.K. have *śṛtám*. The comm. has  
*śṛtam;* and further, in **b**, *prīṇāsi*, rendering it by either  
*pūrayasi* or *tarpayasi*. He takes *raṅháyas* as an adj., =  
*vegavatyas*, which is not unacceptable. The verse is no proper  
*jagatī*, either in movement or in number of syllables (12 + 12: 11 + 14  
= 49). ⌊The comm. has *śivatarābhiḥ* in **d**.⌋

Let all thy rapid flames, O Jatavedas, wherewith thou fillest heaven and earth's mid-region, Follow the goat as he goes on, united: then with the others, most auspicious, aid us.
