### Translation
56. I yoke for thee these two conveyers ⌊*váhni*⌋, to convey (*vah*)  
thee to the other life; with them to Yama's seat and to the assemblies  
go thou down (*áva*).

### Notes
*Ava*, in **d**, is so strange that we can only regard it as a  
corruption for *ápi*, which TA. reads in the corresponding verse (in vi.  
1. 1). TA. also has the better reading *-nīthāya* in **b** ⌊so both  
editions⌋, as has also the comm., though its explanation seems rather to  
imply *-nītāya*. TA. further has the bad accent *vahnī́* in **a**, and  
gives in **c** *yā́bhyām*, and in **d** (for *sámitīs*) *sukṛ́tām*. The  
comm. has *sam iti*, talking *sam* as joint prefix with *ava*, and *iti*  
as *anena prakāreṇa;* our Bp.E. read *sámitī ca;* possibly the comm's  
error is akin with this. According to Kāuś. (80. 34), the verse is used  
when two draft-oxen, or two men, are harnessed to draw the body to the  
funeral pile.
