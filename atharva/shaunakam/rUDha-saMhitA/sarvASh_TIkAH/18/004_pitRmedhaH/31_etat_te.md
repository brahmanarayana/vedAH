### Translation
31. This garment god Savitar gives thee to wear (*bhṛ*); putting on  
that, which is *tārpyà*, do thou go about in Yama's realm.

### Notes
Some of the mss. (including our O.Op.R.) read *dadātu* in **b**. Our Op.  
accents *tā́rpyam*, and the word is variously accented by half of SPP's  
authorities. The comm. first explains the word as *tarpaṇārham  
prītikaram*, and then adds: 'or, made of a kind of grass called *tṛpā*,  
\[and\] anointed with ghee.' For the ritual use of the verse, in company  
with 2. 57, see under the latter verse. The comm. says only that it is  
addressed to the garment when the dead man is wrapped up.
