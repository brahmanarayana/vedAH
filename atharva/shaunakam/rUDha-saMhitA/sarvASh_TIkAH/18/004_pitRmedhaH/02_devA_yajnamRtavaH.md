### Translation
2. The gods, the seasons, arrange the sacrifice, the oblation, the  
sacrificial cake, the ladles (*srúc*), the implements (*-ā́yudha*) of  
sacrifice; with them go thou by roads that the gods travel, by which  
they that have sacrificed go to the heavenly (*svargá*) world.

### Notes
The word *srucás* in **b** is shown by the meter to be probably an  
intrusion, and it is superfluous as regards the sense. ⌊The excision of  
*havís* would give a better cesura.⌋ The verse is, of course, in no way  
a real *jagatī*. Kāuś. (81. 10) directs it to be used as a sacrificial  
cake is laid on the breast of the corpse on the funeral pile; the comm.  
takes no notice of this.
