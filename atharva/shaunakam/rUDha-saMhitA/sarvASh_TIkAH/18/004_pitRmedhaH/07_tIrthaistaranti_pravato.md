### Translation
7. By fords they cross the advances (*pravát*) called the great ones, by  
what \[road\] the sacrifice-makers, the well-doers, go; there did they  
set a world for the sacrificer, when they arranged the quarters, the  
creatures (*bhūtá*).

### Notes
⌊Or, 'By crossings (*tīrthá*) they cross (*tṛ*).'⌋ The comm. explains  
*praváto mahī́r íti* by *prakṛṣṭā mahatīr āpadaḥ...evam;* it also makes  
*díśas* and *bhūtā́ni* in **d** the joint subject of *ákalpayanta*,  
having before taken *adadhus* as an imperative (*vidadhatu*)! Though the  
verse is obscure, the probabilities are doubtless in favor of the  
translation as given. ⌊Pāda a seems to be a reminiscence of 1. 49,  
above, or RV. x. 14. 1. Pischel renders the vs., *Ved. Stud.* ii. 74.⌋

They ford the mighty rivers by the pathway which they who sacrifice, the righteous, travel. There they gave room unto the sacrificer when they made regions and existing creatures.
