### Translation
5. The sacrificial spoon (*juhū́*) sustains the sky, the offering spoon  
(*upabhṛ́t*) the atmosphere; the ladle (*dhruvā́*) sustains ⌊*dhṛ*⌋ the  
earth, the support (*pratiṣṭhā́*); unto me (?) let the worlds,  
ghee-backed, heavenly (*svargá*), yield every desire for the sacrificer.

### Notes
The reading and sense at the beginning of **c** are very doubtful; the  
*pada*-mss. all give *prati॰mā́m*, as if it were accusative of *pratimā́;*  
most of the *saṁhitā*-mss. have *pratīmā́m* (our Bs. has *pratímā́m* ⌊!⌋,  
and P.M. *pratimā́m;* T. has *pratīmám*), and it is quoted in the comment  
to the Prāt. (ii. 35: so the ms.) as the same ⌊that is, I presume, in  
the form *pratīmām*⌋. SPP. emends to *prátī ’mā́m*, since, with his usual  
disregard of the accent, the comm. so reads, explaining *imām* as  
referring to *pṛthivīm;* our edition has *pratimā́m*, with the majority  
of our earlier mss. The translation implies *práti mā́m*, simply on  
account of superior intelligibility; doubtless the true AV. reading is  
*pratīmā́m*. Simply *práti* would rectify the meter, and give a yet  
better sense. The verse (13 + 11: 12 (11?) + 11 = 47) is, of course, no  
proper *jagatī*. This and the verse next following are used, according  
to Kāuś. 81. 7, as the sacrificial utensils are laid about and upon the  
body, to be burned with it.

Upabhrit stablished air, Juhu the heaven, Dhruva supported earth securely founded. As meed, the Svarga worlds, o'erspread with fatness shall yield the sacrificer all his wishes.
