### Translation
80. *Svadhā́* to the Fathers that sit in the sky (*dív*).

### Notes
These verses are found also in Āp. i. 9. 6, and in GGS. iv. 3. 10. GGS.  
has *pṛthivīṣadbhyas* ⌊and *antarīkṣasadbhyas*⌋; both combine *pitṛbhyo  
‘ntar-*; and our O.R.K., with half of SPP's authorities, do the same;  
the Anukr. implies *-bhyo antar-*, but that proves nothing. For the  
ritual use, see under vss. 71, 72 above. Both Āp. and GGS. prescribe the  
verses for the case that the names of the Fathers intended are not  
known.
