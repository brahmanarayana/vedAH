### Translation
34. Grains variegated, yellow, white, grains black, red, \[be\] thy  
milch-kine here; with sesame as calf, yielding (*duh*) him refreshment,  
be they ever unresisting.

### Notes
The verse is found also in TA. (in vi. 7. 1), with its first half  
abbreviated to *éṇīr dhānā́ háriṇīr árjunīḥ santu dhenávaḥ;* and it  
accents *tíla-* in **c** (with our Op. and one or two of SPP's mss.).  
Our O. ⌊and apparently also P.I.⌋, with ⌊one or⌋ two of SPP's mss., also  
accent *enī́s*. Only a minority of the mss. (including our Bs.p.m. and  
Op.) have at the end *-ntīḥ*, the rest *-ntī*. Here and in vs. 36, most  
of the mss. accent *anapasphúr-*, and accordingly both edited texts  
accept it; but the readings ought unquestionably to be emended to  
*ánapasphur-* (which is given here by ⌊TA., Poona ed.,⌋ our O.R., ⌊and  
one or two of SPP's mss.⌋; in 36, by none); the accentuation in this  
part of the text is more than usually faulty. The comm. stupidly  
declares *apasphuraṇa* = *nāśa*, and the participle therefore =  
⌊*avinaśvaryaḥ* or⌋ *akṣīṇāḥ*. ⌊As alternative rendering, W. suggests  
'not refractory.'⌋ ⌊W's 'here' seems to be meant as (the hardly licit)  
version of the accentless *asya:* Weber notices the wild incongruity  
(absent in the TA. version) between *asya* in **a**, *te* in **b**, and  
*asmāí* in **c**.⌋

Let the green grains become thy white, and speckled, The dusky corns become thy ruddy milch-kine. Let those with calves of Sesamum for ever yield strength to him and never flinch from milking.
