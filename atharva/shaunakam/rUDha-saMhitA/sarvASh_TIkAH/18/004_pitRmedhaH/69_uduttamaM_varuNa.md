### Translation
69. Loosen up the uppermost fetter from us, O Varuṇa, \[loosen\] down  
the lowest, off the midmost; then may we in thy sphere, O Āditya, be  
guiltless unto Aditi.

### Notes
The verse ⌊which is RV. i. 24. 15, etc.⌋ occurred above as vii. 83. 3  
⌊which see⌋; among our mss., only O.R. write it out in full. The comm.  
notices the repetition, yet goes on to give a full explication. In Kāuś.  
(82. 8), it is used in the ceremony of the first day after cremation  
(next before 3. 56), with the direction *iti jyeṣṭhaḥ*, apparently  
implying that "the oldest" son of the deceased pours water on the  
attendants; the comm. says that with this verse, immediately after the  
cremation, all the Brahmans should take a bath (*snānaṁ kuryuḥ*).

Loosen, O Varuna, the bond that binds us; loosen the bond above, between, and under. Then under thy protection, O Aditya, may we be sinless and restored to freedom.
