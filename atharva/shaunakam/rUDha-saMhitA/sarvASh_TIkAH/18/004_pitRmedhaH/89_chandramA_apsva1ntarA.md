### Translation
89. The moon among the waters runs, an eagle in the sky (*dív*); they  
find not your track, O golden-rimmed lightnings: know me as such, O  
firmaments (*ródasī*).

### Notes
The verse is RV. i. 105. 1 and also SV. i. 417 ⌊Trāita Sāman⌋; and its  
first two pādas are VS. xxxiii. 90 **a, b**; it is quoted by *pratīka*  
in GB. i. 2. 9; ⌊pāda **e** is refrain all through the RV. hymn, save in  
the last, the 19th, verse⌋. Both RV. and SV. read in **d** *vidyutas*,  
as vocative, and the AV. mss. are divided between that and *vidyútas;*  
SPP. has the former, which is to be preferred. The comm. repeats the  
story of Trita and his two brothers, as "told by the śāṭyāyanins," in  
almost precisely the same words as those in which it is given in the  
commentator's introduction to RV. i. 105. ⌊Oertel gives a summary  
thereof, and also the corresponding passage, JB. i. 184, text and  
version, JAOS. xviii.¹ p. 18-20.⌋ ⌊The comm. quotes the verse as applied  
in *mahāśānti* called *vāruṇī* in the Nakṣatra Kalpa, 18.⌋ Why the verse  
should be found as conclusion of this book of funeral hymns is very  
obscure. ⌊☞ See p. 1016.⌋  
  
⌊Here ends the fourth *anuvāka*, with 1 hymn and 89 verses. The quoted  
Anukr. says *ekonanavatiś cāi ’va yameṣu vihitā ṛcaḥ:* cf. pages 814 and  
869, ¶4, note 1.⌋  
  
⌊Here also ends the thirty-fourth *prapāṭhaka*.⌋

Within the waters runs the Moon, the strong-winged Eagle soars. in heaven. Ye Lightnings with your golden wheels, men find not your abid- ing-place. Hear this my call, O Heaven and Earth.
