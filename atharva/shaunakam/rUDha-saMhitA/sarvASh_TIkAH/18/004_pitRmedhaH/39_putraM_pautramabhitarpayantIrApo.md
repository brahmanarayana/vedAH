### Translation
39. These waters, rich in honey, satisfying (*abhi-tṛp*) son \[and\]  
grandson, yielding to the Fathers *svadhā́* \[and\] *amṛ́ta*—let the  
heavenly waters gratify both sides.

### Notes
That is, the Fathers on the one side, and their living descendants on  
the other. Some of the mss. (including our O.R.) accent *abhí* in **a**.  
The *abhi* could extremely well be spared, and its omission would make  
the verse a good *āstārapan̄kti* ⌊with *triṣṭubh* close in **c** and  
**d**⌋. According to Kāuś., the next verse is used in the  
*piṇḍapitṛyajña* while pouring water on the fire (88. 23), after the  
presentation of the *piṇḍas*, and this one while then rinsing the mouth  
(88. 24).  
  
⌊As to vs. 40, see p. xcvii, note.⌋
