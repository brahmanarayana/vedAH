### Translation
77. Here is *svadhā́* for thee, O father.

### Notes
Passages analogous with these three verses are found in a number of  
other texts: TS. i. 8. 5¹; AśS. ii. 6. 15; Āp. i. 9. 1 (cf. also viii.  
16. 6; xiii. 12. 9); śśS. iv. 4. 2; GGS. iv. 2. 35; śB. ii. 4. 2¹⁹  
forbids the use of *yé ca tvā́m ánu*, and KśS. iv. 1. 12 is of the same  
opinion. ⌊Opposite vs. 75, W. notes K. ix. 6.⌋ In 77 all our mss. save  
one (Op.) read *tátas* instead of *tata;* half of SPP's do the same. In  
Kāuś. 88. 11 the three verses (doubtless: only the *pratīka* of 75 is  
quoted; the comm. says the three) are used on setting down three  
combined (*saṁhata*) *piṇḍas* on the *barhis;* and Vāit. (22. 22)  
employs them similarly in the *agniṣṭoma*. Though 75 is easily read as  
two *anuṣṭubh* pādas, the Anukr. allows it only 15 syllables, refusing  
to resolve *tu-ā́m* here, as it also refuses in 76. ⌊As to vs. 75, see p.  
869, ¶5.⌋ ⌊Apropos of *tata* and *tāta*, the comm. cites AA. i. 3. 3;  
and Sāyaṇa, in his comment on that passage, gives two little tales about  
Prajāpati's early linguistic ventures which remind us somewhat of the  
beautiful  
  
βεκός story as told by Herodotus in the beginning of Euterpe.⌋
