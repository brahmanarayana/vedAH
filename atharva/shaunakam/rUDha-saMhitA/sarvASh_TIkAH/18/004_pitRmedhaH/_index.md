### Comment
The translation implies emendation in a to jātavedasas, though all the mss., and hence both editions, read jātáv-; all, also, accent in c havyavā́has, and SPP. has that in his text; our edition makes the obviously necessary emendation to -vāhás ⌊cf. the opposite error in vs. 10⌋. All our saṁhita-mss. ⌊see Prāt. i. 94, note⌋ make in c the false combination ávāḍh ḍh-; SPP. says nothing of his, and both editions have correctly ávāḍ ḍh-. Our O.Op.R., and one of SPP's mss., read in c iṣitā́; the comm. also has it, explaining it with iṣitāny iṣṭāni. The comm. also understands jātavedasas as vocative (probably, after his manner, simply disregarding the accent); he explains janitrīm as svotpādikām araṇim; and the Kāuś. (80. 23) takes the same view: iti pṛthaś araṇīṣv agnīn samāropayanti; but its correctness as original sense of the verse may be strongly questioned. The comm. explains ā rohata by śaktyātmanā praviśata; and describes the samāropaṇa as taking place "because of the absence of any further ceremonies to be performed by him, being now dead, by help of the fires." In the comm's viniyoga he says simply araṇidvayam agnāu pratāpayet. All this is in the case of a person who has died away from home. But vss. 1-15 are also used nearly at the end of the cremation ceremony (Kāuś. 81. 45), with the direction ity āhitāgnim (Keś. adds upatiṣṭhate), ⌊and the comm. fills out the direction thus: citistham āhitāgnim pretam upatiṣṭheta⌋. The verse, as a triṣṭubh, is redundant by a syllable ⌊in a, which is thus a good jagatī-pāda: and also by one in d, which, however, by reason of its triṣṭubh cadence, is neither one thing nor the other⌋.
