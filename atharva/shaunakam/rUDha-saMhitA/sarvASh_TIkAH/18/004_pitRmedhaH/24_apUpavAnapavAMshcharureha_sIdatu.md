### Translation
24. Rich in cakes, rich in water (*ápa-*), let the dish etc. etc.

### Notes
Instead of *apavant* in this verse, the comm. has a second time  
*apūpavant*, explaining that it means cakes of a different material. In  
the five dishes of TA. (vi. 8) are contained respectively (besides the  
cakes), ghee, boiled flesh (*śṛtá*), milk, curds, and honey. ⌊Caland's  
suggestion of *‘pavantam* for *pacantam* at Kāuś. 86. 4 (see WZKM. viii.  
369) brings the text of Kāuś. into harmony with *ápavāṅs* of this vs.:  
cf. ¶3 of the notes to vs. 16.⌋

Here, mixt with cake and water rest the Charu! World-makers, makers of the path, we worship those Gods of you who here partake oblations.
