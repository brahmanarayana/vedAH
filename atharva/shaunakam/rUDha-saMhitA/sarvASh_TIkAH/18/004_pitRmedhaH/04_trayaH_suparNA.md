### Translation
4. Three eagles (*suparṇá*)...upon the back of the firmament (*nā́ka*),  
at the summit (? *viṣṭáp*) are set (*śritá*); let the heavenly  
(*svargá*) worlds, filled (?) with *amṛ́ta*, yield (*duh*) food,  
refreshment to the sacrificer.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The *pada*-text reads in **a** *māyū́ íti*, which is, I presume, intended  
to mark the word as a locative: see Prāt. i. 74 and note upon it. The  
comm., however, understands it as dual, and explains it as meaning  
*māyumantāu śabdakāriṇāu vāyuparjanyāu*, because Vāyu and Parjanya are  
noisy in connection with clouds; for *upara*, by Nirukta 2. 21, means 'a  
cloud'; and the three eagles are Agni, Sūrya, and Soma! the general  
sense being that Vāyu and Parjanya are set over the world of the  
atmosphere, and the other three over the heavenly world! In **c**, the  
translation follows the comm. ⌊and Whitney's P.M.I, and one of SPP's  
mss.⌋ in reading *viṣṭā́s* instead of *viṣṭhā́s* (p. *vi॰sthā́ḥ*); it is  
glossed with *vyāptāḥ pūrṇāḥ*. Neither this verse nor the preceding is  
quoted by Kāuś., nor has either a *viniyoga* indicated in the comm.

Three eagles in the region's roar are standing high on heaven's ridge in their appointed station. The worlds of Svarga shall, filled full of Amrit, yield food and power to him who sacrificeth.
