### Translation
14. He that hath sacrificed hath ascended the piled fire, about to fly  
up to heaven (*dív*) from the back of the firmament (*nā́ka*); for him,  
the well-doer, shines forth from the welkin (*nábhas*), full of light,  
the heavenly road, traveled by the gods.

### Notes
The mss. vary in **a** between *citám* and *cittám;* our text reads the  
latter; SPP's the former, which is doubtless correct, and which is  
implied by the translation. The comm. notes that *agni* is used to mean  
*iṣṭakacitaḥ pradeśaḥ*, quoting Āpast. 25. 4 as authority. According to  
Kāuś. (80. 52), the verse (the comm. says, vss. 14-15) accompanies the  
laying of the body supine on the pile; it comes next after 1. 46.

Fain to fly up from the sky's ridge to heaven, the worshipper hath mounted visible Agni. Lucid from out the mist to him, the pious, gleams the God- travelled path that leads to Svarga.
