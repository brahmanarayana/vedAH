### Translation
48. Thee, being earth, I make enter into earth; may god Dhātar lengthen  
out our life-time; let him that goeth very far away be a finder of good  
for you; then may the dead (pl.) come to be (*sam-bhū*) among the  
Fathers.

### Notes
The first pāda is identical with that of xii. 3. 22, and hence the comm.  
here makes the blunder of reporting this verse as quoted by Kāuś. 61.  
30,\* whereas it is evidently the other; and he explains the meaning to  
be that earth is smeared upon the vessel ⌊porridge-pot⌋, which is  
entirely out of place in this connection, the analogy being with our own  
phrase "earth to earth." The problematic *párāparāitā* ⌊p.  
*párā॰parāitā*⌋ in **c** is rendered strictly according to its form, as  
if composed of *párā-parā+etṛ;* the Pet. Lexx. render it as "one who  
departs after another or in due order"; but I cannot see how this  
meaning is arrived at. The comm. reads *parāparetās* (our O. gives  
*-retas*), and explains it as *dūradeśam parān̄mukham ito gatāḥ*. The  
comm. also, against *pada*-text and accent, understands *adhā ’mṛtās* in  
**d**. \*⌊Cf. p. 869, ¶7.⌋

As Prithivi rests on earth, so do I seat thee. May the God Dhatar lengthen our existence. For you may he who parts in turn find treasures, but let the Dead among the Fathers.
