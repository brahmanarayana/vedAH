### Translation
88. Thee, O Agni, would we kindle, full of light (*dyumánt*), O god,  
unwasting; as that very wondrous fuel of thine shall shine in the sky  
(*dív*), bring thou food for thy praisers.

### Notes
The verse is RV. v. 6. 4, and occurs also as SV. i. 419 and ii. 372, and  
in TS. iv. 4. 4⁶ and MS. ii. 13. 7. All these agree together throughout,  
reading in **a** *te agna idh-* for *tvā ’gna idh-*, and in **c** *syā́*  
for *sā́*. SPP. reads in **c**, with the comm., *yád gha*, and makes no  
note upon it, implying that his mss. have the same; ours, however, give  
*yád dha* (p. *yát: ha*), in accordance with the other texts. All the  
mss. put an an *avasāna* between **d** and **e** ⌊i.e. after *dyávi*⌋,  
and the Anukr. supports it, whence SPP. has it in his edition; we left  
it out as being uncalled for, and wanting in the parallel texts. For the  
use of the verse in Kāuś. with 3. 42, see the note to the latter: cf. p.  
871, ¶3.

Bright Agni, we will kindle thee, rich in thy splendour, fading. not. So that this glorious fuel may send forth to heaven its light for thee. Bring food to those who sing thy praise.
