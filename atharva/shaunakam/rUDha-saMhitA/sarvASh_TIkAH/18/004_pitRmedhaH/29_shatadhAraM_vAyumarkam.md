### Translation
29. A hundred-streamed Vāyu, a heaven-finding sun (? *arká*), wealth, do  
those men-beholders look upon; whoso bestow (*pṛ*) and present  
(*prayam*) always, they milk a sacrificial gift having seven mothers.

### Notes
The verse corresponds to RV. x. 107. 4, which differs by reading *havís*  
at end of **b**, ⌊and *saṁgamé* at end of **c**⌋; it also reads *duhate*  
in **d** and puts the word after *dákṣiṇām;* the RV. hymn is one in  
praise of generous givers. *Nṛcákṣasas* in **b** might of course be gen.  
sing. (so Grassmann); both translators ⌊Grassmann and Ludwig⌋ take  
*saptámātaram* as 'mother of seven,' which is against the accent; the  
comm. takes it properly as possessive, but gives three different guesses  
at its value. The comm. takes *té* in **b** as 'for thy sake,' against  
the accent. Kāuś. does not quote the verse; the comm. says that it and  
the next are used together on watering the bone-relics with water  
falling from a vessel with a hundred holes; and these hundred holes it  
regards as referred to by the first word of the verse.

Those who observe men look on wealth as Vayu with countless. streams, and as light-finding Arka; Those drain out Guerdon sprung from seven mothers, who satis- fy and evermore give presents.
