### Translation
33. Be these, O so-and-so, thy milch-kine that yield what is desired;  
variegated, white, of like form, of different form, with sesame as calf,  
let them wait upon (*upa-sthā*) thee there.

### Notes
One of our mss. (Op.), and three or four of SPP's authorities, accent  
*tílavatsās* in **d**. The comm. has *bhavanti* in **b**. The verse (8 +  
7: 11 + 11 = 37) is not at all an *upariṣṭādbṛhatī*, but rather an  
irregular *āstārapan̄kti*.

Let these become thy milch-kine, man! supplying all thy heart's desires. There, speckled, white, like-hued and various-coloured, with calves of Sesamum let them stand beside thee.
