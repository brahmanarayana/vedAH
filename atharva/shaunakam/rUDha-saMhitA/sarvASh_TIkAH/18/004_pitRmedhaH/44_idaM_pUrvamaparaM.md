### Translation
44. This \[is\] the former, the after down-track, by which thy former  
Fathers went away; they who are the forerunners, the followers (?  
*abhiṣác*) of it, they carry thee to the world of the well-doing.

### Notes
Our reading *abhiṣā́cas* is an emendation, almost every ms. giving  
*abhiśā́cas* (our Op. has *abhi॰sā́caḥ*, and also one ⌊or two⌋ of SPP's  
authorities); *-ṣā́c-* is of course intended, and the comm. gives it.  
SPP's text follows the mss. The comm. explains *niyāna* as the wagon  
(*śakaṭa*) on which the corpse is carried to the funeral pile; and the  
'forerunners' and 'followers' as the oxen that draw it, in front and on  
all sides: which is doubtless not at all the true sense; he also reads  
*vahantu* in **d**. The verse is one of the *hariṇīs* ⌊Kāuś. 80. 35; 82.  
31 note⌋: see under 1. 61. It lacks (in **a**) a syllable of being a  
full *triṣṭubh*. Its second pāda is identical with 1. 54 **b**.

This is the ancient, this the recent pathway, by which thy sires of olden time departed. They who first travelled it, and they who followed, convey thee to the world where dwell the righteous.
