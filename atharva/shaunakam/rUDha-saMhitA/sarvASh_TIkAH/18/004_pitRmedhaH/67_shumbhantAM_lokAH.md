### Translation
67. Let the worlds where the Fathers sit adorn themselves (*śumbh*); I  
make thee to sit in the world where the Fathers sit.

### Notes
The first phrase is VS. v. 26 f, which, however, reads *śúndhantām;* Āp.  
vii. 9. 10 has *śundhatāṁ lokaḥ pitṛṣadanaḥ*. ⌊For variants as between  
*śundh* and *śumbh*, cf. notes to vi. 115. 3; xii. 2. 40; 3. 13, 21, 26;  
xviii. 3. 56.⌋

Bright be to thee those worlds where dwell the Fathers! I seat thee in that sphere which they inhabit.
