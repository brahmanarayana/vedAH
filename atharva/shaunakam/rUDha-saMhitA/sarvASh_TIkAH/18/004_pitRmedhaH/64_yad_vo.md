### Translation
64. What one limb of you Agni Jātavedas left when making you go to the  
Fathers' world, that same for you I fill up again; revel ye, O Fathers,  
in heaven (*svargá*) with \[all\] your limbs.

### Notes
HGS. has (in ii. 11. 1) an analogous but quite different verse: *yad vaḥ  
kravyād an̄gam adahal lokān ayam praṇayañ jātavedāḥ: tad vo ’ham punar ā  
veśayāmy ariṣṭāḥ sarvāir an̄gāiḥ sam bhavata pitaraḥ*. Most of our mss.  
(all except O.Op.R.), but, by his account, only one of SPP's, leave  
*ajahāt* in **a** unaccented; on the other hand, all without exception  
accent in **d** *pitáras*, which SPP. accordingly admits into his text;  
but our emendation to *pitáras* is plainly necessary. What the comm.  
says is here unknown, because the manuscript shows a considerable  
lacuna, involving the latter half of the explanation of this verse, with  
the text of the next and the larger part of its exposition. Kāuś. uses  
the verse (88. 5) in the *piṇḍapitṛyajña*, next after vss. 74, 78, to  
accompany an offering of rice-grains with the stirring-stick (*sāyavana*  
⌊that is, *sa-āyavana:* SPP's *saṁyavana*, p. 233⁴, does not seem  
right⌋). ⌊As to completeness of limbs in the other world, see my note to  
4. 12, above. This verse was translated metrically by Whitney, *O. and  
L.S.*, i. 57.⌋

If Agni Jatavedas, as he bore you hence to the Fathers' world, hath left one single. Limb of your bodies, here do I restore it. Fathers, rejoice in heaven with all your members!
