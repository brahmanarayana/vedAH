### Translation
10. Ye, O Agni, having become back-carrying (? *pṛṣṭiváh*) horses, shall  
with most healthful forms (*tanū́*) carry him that has sacrificed unto  
the heavenly (*svargá*) world, where they revel in common revelry with  
the gods.

### Notes
The doubtful word in this verse is pṛṣṭivā́has (as both editions read).  
All our mss. save one (Op.), and the majority of SPP's, accent  
*pṛṣṭivāhás*, as if nom. sing, of *-vāhá*, apparently by an error the  
opposite of that committed in vs. 1. Two of our later collated mss.  
(Op.R.),and one of SPP's by correction ⌊as if to correspond with  
*-vāhás*, have *áśvas* before it; and the comm. also reads *aśvas*, with  
*praṣṭivāhas*, explaining that *praṣṭi* is a chariot of the gods,  
harnessed with three horses, of which one is in front and two behind;  
and a *praṣṭivāha* horse is, of course, one that draws such a chariot.  
⌊Cf. vi. 102. 2 and note.⌋ ⌊Four⌋ of our mss. ⌊Bs.M.I.T.⌋, but only one  
of SPP's, leave *madanti* unaccented at the end; ⌊Whitney's Bp.O.Op.R.K.  
accent it, as it should be⌋; the comm. reads instead *madema*. The  
Anukr. passes without notice the deficiency of a syllable in **b**.

Do ye, with your most kindly forms, O Agni, waft, turned to rapid steeds whose ribs bear burthens, The sacrificer to the world of Svarga where with the Gods they banquet and are joyful.
