### Translation
26. What grains I scatter along for thee, mixed with sesame, rich in  
*svadhā́*, be they for thee uprising (*udbhú*), prevailing; them let king  
Yama approve for thee.

### Notes
This verse, differing from 3. 69 and 4. 43 by a single word (*udbhvī́s*  
instead of *vibhvī́s*), is written out in full by all the mss. The comm.  
has, instead of *udbhvīs*, *abhvīs*, glossing it with *mahatyas*. ⌊For a  
possible ritual use of the verse, see under 3. 69.⌋

Grains which for thee I scatter, mixt with Sesamum, as holy food. May they for thee be excellent and potent. King Yama look on, them as thine with favour!
