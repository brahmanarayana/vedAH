### Translation
59. Let thy sparkling (? *tveṣá*) smoke cover, being in the sky,  
extended bright; for thou, O purifier, shinest like the sun with luster,  
with beauty (*kṛpā́*).

### Notes
The verse is RV. vi. 2. 6 and SV. i. 83; both read *ṛṇvati* in **a**;  
⌊in **b**, SV. combines *diví sáṅ ch-:* cf. *diví ṣáṅ ch-* at xvii. 1.  
12⌋. The comm. explains *kṛpā* as = *kṛpayā* or *stutyā*. Vāit. (6. 11)  
uses the verse, with others, in the ceremony of establishing the fires.
