### Translation
37. This funeral pile (? *kásāmbu*) \[is\] piled with piling; come, ye  
\[his\] fellows, look down at it; this mortal goeth to immortality; make  
ye houses for him according to his kindred.

### Notes
A number of the mss. (including our P.M.I.) read in **a** *cittám*, as  
in 14 **a** above. The *pada*-text at end of **b** is *paśyata: ā́: ita*.  
Some of the mss. make a blundering insertion of signs of *kampa* in  
*mártyo ‘yám* in **c**. O. has at the end *-sámbudham*. The comm. shows  
its usual skill in explaining *kasāmbu;* it means *kasāś cā ’mbūni ca,  
kasa* being by abbreviation from *kīkasa*, and = *asthi!* Kāuś. (86. 1)  
has the verse accompany the viewing of the bone-relics ⌊which are now in  
the trench, says Keś.⌋ by the 'fellows' of the deceased; the comm. says  
that either the relatives or all are to look at them as deposited in the  
hollow, while the manager recites the verse. The meter of the last pāda  
is redundant, and suggests emendation of the closing word. ⌊The vs.,  
with its *cayanena citam* and *gṛhān* (cf. śB. as cited below under vs.  
55), seems clearly to refer to a grave-mound; but the ritual use, with  
its trench, is in flat contradiction with such reference.⌋
