### Translation
56. Wear (*bhṛ*) thou this gold, which thy father wore before; of thy  
father, going to heaven (*svargá*), do thou wipe off the right hand.

### Notes
The majority of mss. read *pitur* in **c**, some *pítur*, and hardly any  
(of ours, only Op.) *pitúr*. Many of ours have *mṛḍhḍhi* in **d**: see  
Prāt. i. 94 and note. The comm. strangely gives *pipṛhi* ⌊cf. xiii. 1.  
1, note⌋ in **a** (though *abibhar* in **b**!). According to Kāuś. 80.  
46, 47, the first half-verse is used as the manager takes with the right  
hand some gold worn by the deceased, smears it with ghee, and passes it  
to the eldest son; the second half-verse, as he makes him wipe off his  
(of course, the father's) right hand; the comm. states it thus: "with  
the first half he makes the oldest son heat (*ādipayet:* as if the comm.  
read in Kāuś. *ādīpayati* instead of *ādāp-*) in the fire gold found in  
the hand of the deceased; with the other half the son should wipe the  
deceased's hand."

Take thou and wear this piece of gold, the gold thy father used to wear. Wipe tenderly the right hand of thy sire who goes away to heaven.
