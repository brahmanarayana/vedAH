### Translation
57. Both those who are living and those who are dead; those who are born  
and those who are worshipful—for them let there go a brook of ghee,  
honey-streamed, overflowing.

### Notes
We had the second half-verse above as 3. 72 **c, d**, only with  
*śatádhārā* instead of *mádhudhārā*. The mss. are again at variance as  
to the accent of *kulyā;* and the majority also accent *madhúdhārā*, as  
if they had *śatádh-* in mind ⌊cf. end of note to 1. 42 above⌋.  
*Yajñíya* is a queer antithesis to *jātá*, and the comm. reads instead  
*jajñiyās*, explaining it as *jajñim utpattiṁ yānti gacchanti:* that is,  
*jajñi*—root *yā!* The comm. also understands in **d** *madhudhārās*, as  
object of *vyundatī*. A corresponding verse is found in TA. (in vi. 12):  
it omits the first *ca* in **a**; has at end of **b** the almost  
acceptable reading *jántyās* (it ought to be *jántvās*); offers in **c**  
the curious corruption *dhārayitum* for *kulyāi ’tu;* ⌊and accents  
*mádhudhārā* in **d**⌋. The schol. add the verse to 56, as used by Kāuś.  
80. 46; the Kāuś. uses it twice with 3. 72: see under that verse; in TA.  
it has an utterly different application, in the ceremony of turning  
loose the cow that was led with the corpse to the funeral pile.

To all, the living and the dead, all that are born, the worshipful. Let the full brook of fatness run, o'erflowing, with stream of mead.
