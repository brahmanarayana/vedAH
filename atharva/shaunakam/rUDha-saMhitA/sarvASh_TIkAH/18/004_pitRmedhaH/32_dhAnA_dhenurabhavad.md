### Translation
32. The grains became a milch-cow; the sesame became her calf; upon her,  
unexhausted, one lives in Yama's realm.

### Notes
The mss. are a little at variance as to the accent of *tilo ‘bhavat;*  
but the majority give *tilò*, which is accepted in both editions. The  
comm. reads at the end *jīvāti*. The ritual application of this verse  
and its successor was given with that of 3. 69 above; the comm. says  
here that with vss. 32-34 grains mingled with sesame are put upon the  
bones. The first pāda is one syllable short.
