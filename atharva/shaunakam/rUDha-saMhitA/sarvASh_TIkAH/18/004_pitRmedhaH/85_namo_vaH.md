### Translation
85. Homage to you, O Fathers; *svadhā́* to you, O Fathers.

### Notes
For a wonder, these formulas are written by all the mss. without  
variation and without error. Corresponding passages are to be found in  
many other texts: VS. ii. 32; TB. i. 3. 10⁸; MS. i. 10. 3; K. ix. 6;  
śśS. iv. 5. 1; AśS. ii. 7. 7; Āp. i. 10. 2 and xiii. 12. 10; GGS. iv. 3.  
18-21; MB. ii. 3. 8-11; none of them agree closely with our text; but  
the details of accordance and of difference are not worth giving. In  
Kāuś. (88. 26) they accompany in the *piṇḍapitṛyajña* the reverence  
(*upasthāna*) paid to the Fathers, being then followed by vss. 61 and  
63. \*⌊That is, 'to your terror-inspiring fury.'⌋
