### Translation
43. What grains I scatter along for thee, mixed with sesame, rich in  
*svadhā́*, be they for thee abundant, prevailing; them let king Yama  
approve for thee.

### Notes
This is a repetition of 3. 69, being distinguished as such (and not of  
4. 26) by the words *íti pū́rvā*, instead of *íty ékā*, after the pratīka  
in most of the mss. Nevertheless, the two *saṁhitā*-mss. of ours (O.R.)  
which give it in full, read *udbhvī́s* in **c**, the word in 4. 26,  
instead of *vibhvī́s*, that in 3. 69; and the comm. also states the  
repetition to be of 4. 26; and SPP's text reads accordingly. ⌊For the  
ritual, see under 3. 69.⌋

Grains which for thee I scatter, mixt with Sesamum as sacred food, May these for thee be excellent and potent. King Yama look on, them, as thine, with favour.
