### Translation
25. What vessels covered with cakes the gods maintained for thee, be  
they for thee rich in *svadhā́*, rich in honey, dripping with ghee.

### Notes
This is a ⌊precise⌋ repetition of 3. 68 above. While most of the mss.  
quote it, as usual, by the first words with *íty ékā* added, two (O.R.)  
write it in full. According to the comm., the verse follows the  
deposition of the nine dishes; and it adds: "one should put on mixed  
grains"; the Kāuś. makes no mention of it.

Let these which Gods have held for thee, these beakers covered o'er with cake, Be full of sacred food for thee, distilling fatness, rich in mead.
