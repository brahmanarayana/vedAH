### Translation
65. Jātavedas has been the messenger sent forth, at evening, at close of  
day to be honored by men;—thou hast given to the Fathers; they have  
eaten after their wont; eat thou, O god, the presented oblations.

### Notes
We had the second half-verse above as 3. 42 **c, d**. Part of our mss.  
(O.Op.R.D.), with, so far as appears, the majority of SPP's, read in  
**b** *upavándyas*, and the latter accordingly adopts it in his text;  
the root *vand* does not appear to be anywhere else combined with *upa*.  
The line reads like a kind of echo of RV. iv. 54. i ⌊TB. iii. 7. 13⁴⌋.  
The verse is the last one quoted in the *piṇḍapitṛyajña* by Kāuś. (89.  
14), to accompany the withdrawal of the "extended" fires. ⌊By "extended"  
I suppose W. means the technical *praṇīta* (cf. comm., p. 233⁶). The  
words of Kāuś. are *agnim pratyānayati:* the ceremony seems to be the  
same as that prescribed by śB. at ii. 4. 2²⁴, *punar ulmukam api  
sṛjati*, and by śśS. at iv. 5. 9, *ulmukam agnāu kṛtvā*.⌋
