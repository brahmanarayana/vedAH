### Translation
13. The sacrifice goes, extended, adapting itself (? *kḷp*), \[taking\]  
him who hath sacrificed, unto the heavenly (*svargá*) world; let the  
fires enjoy it, made a whole oblation; let the Jātavedases, making done  
here him that is Prajāpati's \[and\] sacrificial, not throw him down.

### Notes
⌊Cf. vs. 12.⌋ 'Sacrifice' and 'whole oblation' ⌊and 'it,' that is *tám*  
in **c**,⌋ all refer, of course, to the deceased himself. ⌊Cf. Whitney,  
Oriental and Linguistic Studies, i. 56: "To burn the body of a deceased  
person was accordingly an act of solemn sacrifice, which made Agni its  
bearer to the other world, the future dwelling of its former  
possessor."—Cf. also Caland's most apposite citation from Bāudhāyana,  
*jātasaṁskāreṇe ’maṁ lokam abhijayati; mṛtasaṁskāreṇā ’muṁ lokam*, in  
his *Todtengebräuche*, pages 174, 178.⌋ The defective meter and  
incomplete construction of b make it altogether probable that the text  
is corrupt: *ījānā́nām* would help both. The comm. makes no difficulty of  
taking *abhi..eti* causatively, = *abhigamayati*. He paraphrases  
*kalpámānas* by *iṣṭam pradeśam prāpayituṁ samarthaḥ*. The mss. vary  
between *kalpámānas, kálpamānas*, and *kalpamā́nas;* all of ours that  
were collated before printing had *kalpá-*, which we accordingly  
admitted in our text; but we ought to have emended to *kálpa-*, which  
SPP. reads. Two of our mss. (O.R.), and one of SPP's, also have  
*jātavedasaḥ* at end of **d**. The verse counts just a full *atiśakvarī*  
(11 + 10: 11 + 12: 12 = 56).
