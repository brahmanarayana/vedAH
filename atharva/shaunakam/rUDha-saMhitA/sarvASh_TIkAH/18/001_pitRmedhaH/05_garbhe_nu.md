### Translation
5. Verily, the generator made us (du.) in the womb man and spouse—god  
Tvashṭar, Savitar of all forms; none overthrow (*pra-mī*) his ordinances  
(*vratá*); earth knows us ⌊two⌋ as such, also heaven.

### Notes
RV. x. 10. 5 has no variants. The treatment oi *pṛthivī́* in **d** as  
*pragṛhya* is noticed in Prāt. iii. 34 **c**. ⌊Presumably, W's literal  
version of **d** would be 'earth is cognizant of that \[fact\] of us  
two, also heaven.'⌋

Even in the womb God Tvashtar, vivifier, shaping all forms, Creator, made us consorts. Ne'er are his holy statutes violated: that we are his the heaven and earth acknowledge.
