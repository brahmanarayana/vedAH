### Translation
35. In whom the gods revel at the council, maintain themselves in  
Vivasvant's seat—they placed light in the sun, rays in the moon: the  
two, unfailing, wait upon (*pari-car*) the brightness (*dyotaní*).

### Notes
The verse is x. 12. 7, without variant. The comm. separates *yásmin*  
from *vidáthe*, supplying *agnāu* for the former to qualify (the RV.  
comm. does the same); perhaps rather *manmani* is to be inferred from  
the following verse. ⌊W. suggests by a note to his ms. as an alternative  
for **a**, 'In what council the gods revel.'⌋ Our comm. also explains,  
in **d**, *dyotaním* by *dyotamānam agnim*, and it reads *ajasram*,  
understanding it adverbially; *aktūn* in **c** is either *raśmīn* or  
*rātrīs*. ⌊This vs. and the next are discussed by Foy, KZ. xxxiv. 228.⌋

They in the synod where the Gods rejoice them, where they are seated in Vivasvan's dwelling, Have given the Moon his beams, the Sun his splendour: the two unweariedly maintain their brightness.
