### Translation
57. Lightful (*dyumánt*) would we light thee, lightful would we kindle;  
do thou, lightful, bring the lightful Fathers to eat the oblation.

### Notes
More than half the mss. (including all ours except O.Op.T.K. ⌊which have  
*dyumatá*, p. *dyu॰matáḥ*⌋) read *dyumantás* in **c**, which we  
accordingly adopted in our text, though the form is of course  
ungrammatical; SPP. reads correctly *dyumatás*. ⌊Cf. my  
*Noun-Inflection*, p. 521.⌋ ⌊This vs. is a mere variation of the  
preceding, with *dyumánt*-forms in place of *uśánt*-forms. Perhaps in  
this connection the fact is noteworthy that W's codex I. does not accent  
the vs. Here again the comm. reads *havāmahe* for *idhimahi*.⌋

We, splendid men, deposit thee, we, splendid men, enkindle thee. Splendid, bring splendid Fathers nigh to eat the sacrificial food.
