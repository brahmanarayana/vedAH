### Translation
47. Mātālī with the *kavyás*, Yama with the An̄girases, Brihaspati  
increasing with the *ṛ́kvans* ('praisers'); both they whom the gods  
increased and who \[increased\] the gods—let those Fathers aid us at our  
calls.

### Notes
RV. x. 14. 3 has the first three pādas, but, instead of repeating our 44  
**d**, reads for the fourth *svā́hā ‘nyé svadháyā ‘nyé madanti;* and TS.  
(ii. 6. 12⁵) and MS. (iv. 14. 16) agree with it in so doing.

Matali prospers there with Kavyas, Yama with Angiras' sons, Brihaspati with singers. Exalters of the Gods, by Gods exalted, aid us those Fathers in our invocations?
