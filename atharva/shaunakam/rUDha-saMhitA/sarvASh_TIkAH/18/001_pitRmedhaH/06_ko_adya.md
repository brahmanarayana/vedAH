### Translation
6. Who yokes to the pole today the kine of righteousness, the diligent,  
the bright, the slow to wrath (? *durhṛṇāyú*), that have arrows in the  
mouth, that shoot at the heart, amiable ones? whoso shall prosper their  
burden, he shall live.

### Notes
This strangely intruded verse ⌊cf. Weber, *Sb.* 1895, p. 819 n.⌋ is RV.  
i. 84. 16 (also found in TS. iv. 2. 11³; MS. iii. 16. 4), without  
variant ⌊save that TS. accents *dúrhṛṇāyūn*. SV. has it at i. 341 (next  
after our verse 1), with the bad variants *āsánn eṣām apsuvā́haḥ* in  
**c**. ⌊Cf. Aufrecht's *Rigveda*², vol. i., preface, p. xliv.⌋ The comm.  
understands *bhṛtyā́m ṛṇádhat* in **d** as here translated; also  
*durhṛṇāyū́n* ⌊alternatively⌋ in **b**.

Who yokes to-day unto the pole of Order the strong and passio- nate steers of checkless spirit, With shaft-armed mouths, heart-piercing, joy-bestowing? Long shall he live who duly pays them service.
