### Translation
19. Prateth the Gandharvī and watery woman; in the noise of the noisy  
one (*nadá*) let \[her\] protect our mind; let Aditi set us in the midst  
of what is desired (? *iṣṭá*); our oldest brother shall first speak out.

### Notes
RV. x. 11. 2 has for sole variant *me* for *nas* in **b**. The comm. to  
the first half-verse appears to be defective; but it certainly  
understands the goddesses Bhāratī and Sarasvatī to be intended in **a**;  
*iṣṭasya* is either *phalasya* or *yāgasya;* the "brother" is Agni.  
⌊Pischel discusses the RV. verse at *Ved. Stud.* i. 183.⌋

Gandharvi spake. May she, the Lady of the Flood amid the river's roaring leave my heart untouched. May Aditi accomplish all that we desire, and may our eldest Brother tell us this as chief.
