### Translation
23. Send thou up the (two) fathers, \[as\] a lover, unto enjoyment  
(*bhága*). The welcome one (*haryatá*) desires to sacrifice; he sends  
from the heart; the bearer (*váhni*) speaks out; the merry one (?  
*makhá*) does a good work; the Asura shows might (*taviṣy*); he trembles  
with purpose (? *matī́*).

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The verse is RV. x. 11. 6, without variant. It is extremely obscure, and  
the general sense, as well as the meaning of several words, is in a high  
degree doubtful; the translation given is no more than mechanical. ⌊Cf.  
Weber, p. 829.⌋ The 'two fathers' (parents) are declared by the comm.,  
probably rightly, to be heaven and earth; *jāras* is explained as  
*ādityas*, and *ā* as = *iva*. Or, alternatively, *jāras* is "praiser,"  
coming from *jarā* "praise," and to **a** is to be supplied *hvayati*.  
The *iṣyati* is made = *icchati;* *vahni* is Agni; *makhas* is  
*makhasādhano maṅhanīyo vā;* *taviṣyate* is *vardhiṣyate*. All this is  
of interest only as showing that no help is to be obtained from the  
native exegetes.

Urge thou thy Parents, as a lover, to delight: the lovely One desires and craves it from his heart. As Priest he calls aloud, as Warrior shows his skill, as Asura tries his strength, and with the hymn is stirred.
