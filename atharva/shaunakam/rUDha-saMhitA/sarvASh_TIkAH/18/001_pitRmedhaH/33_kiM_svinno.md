### Translation
33. Why forsooth hath the king seized (*grah*) us? what have we done in  
transgression of (*áti*) his ordinance (*vratá*)? who discerns \[it\]?  
for even Mitra, swerving the gods, like a song of praise (*ślóka*), is  
the might also of them that go.

### Notes
The verse is RV. x. 12. 5, without variant. The second half-verse,  
especially the last pāda, is bafflingly obscure. The accent of *ásti*,  
as well as the absence of other construction for *mitrás*, strongly  
indicates that the whole of the second half-verse forms one sentence; in  
which case *vā́jas* is perhaps most probably a corruption. The comm.  
understands *rā́jā* in **a** as Yama, and *jagṛhe* as signifying his  
"acceptance" of offerings—which is very ill guessed; doubtless it is  
Varuṇa (so Ludwig; the RV. comm. makes it Agni). He then renders  
*juhurāṇás* most absurdly by *āhvayan*, ⌊saying that "the root *hvṛ*  
'crook' is here used in the sense of root *hū* 'call'"⌋. He reads in  
**d** (as do some of the mss., including our O.Op.R.) *yātān*, as accus.  
of the pple *yāta*, qualifying *devān* understood, rendering *devān  
abhigacchato no ‘smān rakṣitum!* and so on. The version of the line  
given above is of course mechanical only.

Hath the King seized us? How have we offended against his holy Ordinance? Who knoweth? For even Mitra mid the Gods is angry. There are both song and wealth for those who come not.
