### Translation
7. Who knows of that first day? who saw it? who shall proclaim it here?  
Great is the ordinance (*dhā́man*) of Mitra, of Varuṇa; why, O lustful  
one, wilt thou speak to men with deceit (? *vī́ci*)?

### Notes
RV. x. 10. 6 has no variants. The comm. blunderingly attributes the  
verse to Yamī; he also takes *vī́cyā* ⌊p. *vī́cyā*⌋ as for *vī́cyās*, an  
adj. meaning *vividham añcanto gacchantaḥ saṁcarantaḥ*, and qualifying  
*nṛ́n*, which is used as nominative, = *narās!* ⌊See Geldner,  
*Gurupūjākaumudī*, p. 21-22.⌋

Who knows that earliest day whereof thou speakest, Who hath beheld it? Who can here declare it? Great is the law of Varuna and Mitra. What, wanton, wilt thou say to men to tempt them?
