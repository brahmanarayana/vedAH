### Translation
61. These ascended up from here; they ascended the backs of the sky  
(*dív*); the An̄girases have gone forth to heaven (*dív*), like  
*bhūrjís*, by the road.

### Notes
The verse is found in SV. (i. 92), which combines in **b** *diváḥ pṛ-*,  
accents *bhūrjáyas* in **c** and inserts *úd* before *dyā́m* and leaves  
*yayus* unaccented in **d**. It also accents *udā́ruhan* in **a**, as  
does our edition; but the mss. decidedly favor *úd ā́ ’ruhan* (p. *út: ā́:  
aruhan*), and SPP. rightly adopts this reading. The comm. reads *etad*  
instead of *ete* in **a**; it makes *bhūrjáyas* (p. *bhūḥ॰jáyaḥ;* SV. p.  
*bhūḥ: jáyah*, this *pada*-text dividing compound words without any  
hyphen or its equivalent between the parts) an epithet of the An̄girases,  
rendering it by *bharaṇavanto bhuvaṁ jitavanto vā*, and justifies the  
accent of *yayús* by treating *yáthā* as = *yādṛśena* "by what road the  
*bhūrjis* went" etc. SPP. accents *bhūrjáyas* on the authority of a  
single one of his mss.; all ours leave it without accent (in our text  
the accent-mark under its final syllable has become lost in printing);  
both Pet. Lexx. ignore the word entirely; its real meaning is wholly  
obscure, as it seems to have been to the makers of the *pada*-text; for  
their suggested etymology is plainly valueless. The verse is used by  
Kāuś. (80. 35), with 2. 48, 53; 3. 8, 9; 4. 44, in preparing for taking  
the body of the deceased person to the funeral pile; the six verses are  
called *hariṇīs*, and are repeatedly employed in other parts of the  
funeral and ancestral rites (82. 31; 83. 20, 23; 84. 13); also by Vāit.  
(37. 24), in a like connection. ⌊Here ends the first *anuvāka*, with 1  
hymn and 61 verses. The quoted Anukr. says *ekaṣaṣṭiś ca*.⌋
