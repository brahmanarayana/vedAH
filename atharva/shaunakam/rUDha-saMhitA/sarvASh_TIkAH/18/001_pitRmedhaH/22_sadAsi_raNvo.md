### Translation
22. Ever art thou pleasant (*raṇvá*), as pastures to him that enjoys  
(*puṣ*) them, being, O Agni, well sacrificed to with the offerings of  
man (*mánus*); or when, active, praiseworthy, having won the strength  
(*vā́ja*) of the inspired one (*vípra*), thou approachest with very many.

### Notes
RV. x. 11. 5 differs only by reading *ukthyàm* at end of **c**. The  
construction and meaning of the second half-verse are difficult and  
obscure. The comm. explains *śaśamānas* by *śaṅsan yajamānam praśaṅsan*  
(similarly the comm. to RV.); and *bhūribhis* as "accompanied by many  
desires or else by many gods" (RV. comm. only the latter).

Still art thou kind to him who feeds thee as with grass, and. skilled in sacrifice offers thee holy gifts. When thou having received the sage's strengthening food with lauds, after long toil comest with many more.
