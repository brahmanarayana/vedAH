### Translation
24. Whatever mortal hath seen thy favor, O Agni, son of power, he is  
renowned exceedingly; acquiring (*dhā*) food (*íṣ*), borne by horses,  
he, lightful, vigorous, passes (? *ā-bhūṣ*) the days (*dív*).

### Notes
RV. x. 11. 7 reads in **a** *ákṣat*, of which our *ákhyat* is doubtless  
only a corruption. Our Bp. and one of SPP's authorities have *akṣat*.  
The comm. renders *ā bhūṣati* by *ābhavati;* ⌊he adds alternatively:  
*bhūṣati* = *bubhūṣati*, *dyumān...bhavitum icchati*⌋. In **b** he reads  
*abhi* instead of *ati*.
