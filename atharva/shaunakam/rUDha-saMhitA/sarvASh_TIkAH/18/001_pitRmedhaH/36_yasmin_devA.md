### Translation
36. In what secret (*apīcyà*) devotion (*mánman*) the gods go about  
(*sam-car*)—we know it not; may Mitra, may Aditi, may god Savitar  
declare us here guiltless to Varuṇa.

### Notes
The verse is RV. x. 12. 8, without variant. Our comm. explains *mánmani*  
by *mantavye sthāne varuṇākhye*.

The counsel which the Gods meet to consider, their secret plan, of that we have no knowledge. There let God Savitar, Aditi, and Mitra proclaim to Varuna that we are sinless.
