### Translation
32. If the god's immortality (*amṛ́ta*) is easy to appropriate for the  
cow, thence those who are born maintain themselves on the broad  
\[earth\]; all the gods go after that sacrificial formula of thine, when  
the hind yields (*duh*) the ghee, heavenly liquor (*vā́r*).

### Notes
The verse is RV. x. 12. 3, without variant. It is all extremely obscure,  
especially the first pāda, which admits of being rendered in  
half-a-dozen different ways; the translation given is purely tentative.  
The comm. gives little help. The *pada*-text does not divide or  
otherwise change *svā́vṛk*, which indicates that its makers did not see  
in the word the formation *su-ā-vṛj*, which is plausibly seen in it by  
western scholars and by our comm. The latter takes *urvī́* (p. *urvī́  
íti*) as dual, but in the Prāt. it is quoted by the comment (to i. 74)  
as example of a locative in *ī*, which it doubtless is. Our comm.  
derives *yájus* first from root *yuj* and makes it = *karman;* *devās*  
is again, as above (vs. 31), *stotāras*, *ṛtvijas*. ⌊With the expression  
*divyáṁ vā́ḥ*, applied to ghee, compare the expression at x. 4. 3, *vā́r  
ugrám*, applied to snake-venom, which may well be called a 'terrible  
fluid': but see note to x. 4. 3.⌋
