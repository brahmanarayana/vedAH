### Translation
30. A god, encompassing the gods with right, carry thou first our  
offering, understanding \[it\]; smoke-bannered by the fuel,  
light-beaming, a pleasant, constant *hótṛ*, skilled sacrificer with  
speech.

### Notes
The verse is RV. x. 12. 2, without variant. The majority of SPP's mss.,  
with one of ours (Op.), read *bhā́rcīko* in **c**. Neither our Anukr. nor  
that of the RV. notes the deficiency of a syllable in **a**.
