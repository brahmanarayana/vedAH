### Translation
34. Hard to reverence (? *durmántu*) here is the name of the immortal,  
that she of like sign should become of diverse form; whoso shall  
reverence Yama with proper reverence (? *sumántu*), him, O Agni, exalted  
one, do thou protect, unremitting.

### Notes
This verse is found also as RV. x. 12. 6, without variant, but the RV.  
comm. passes it without notice, as if recognizing it as not genuine. It  
is very strange to find repeated here as **b** vs. 2 **b**, above, as  
the connection this time does not explain the feminine words in it. The  
comm. first explains (like Grassmann) the pāda as quoted from the other  
verse; but goes on to add other interpretations. He defines *durmántu*  
by *durmananaṁ durvacam*.

'Tis hard to understand the Immortal's nature, where she who is akin becomes a stranger. Guard ceaselessly, great Agni, him who ponders Yama's name easy to be comprehended.
