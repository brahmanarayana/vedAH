### Translation
54. Go thou forth, go forth by roads that go to the stronghold  
(*pūryā́ṇa*), as (*yénā*) thy Fathers of old went forth; both kings,  
reveling with *svadhā́*, shalt thou see, Yama and god Varuṇa.

### Notes
Or *svadháyā* may be 'at their pleasure' or 'according to their wont.'  
The corresponding RV. verse (x. 14. 7) has in **a-b** *pathíbhiḥ  
pūrvyébhir yátrā naḥ pū́rve pitáraḥ pareyúḥ*, and, in **c**, *rā́jānā* and  
*mádantā;* and MS. (in iv. 14. 16) agrees with it except in reading,  
with our text, *páretās* ⌊in **b**, and in having *pūrvébhis* in **a**⌋.  
Our comm. reads *rājānā* in **c**. Prāt. iii. 83 prescribes the *ṇ* in  
*pūryā́ṇāis* (p. *pūḥ॰yā́nāiḥ*); the comm. absurdly explains the word as =  
*pumāṅso yena...yanti!* for the *pūr*, compare x. 2. 28 ff.; xix. 17 and  
19. The Anukr. takes no notice of the metrical irregularity in the  
verse. ⌊It is due to the displacement of *pūrviébhis* by *pūryā́ṇāis:*  
the secondary character of the latter (occurring elsewhere only at 4. 63  
below) is palpable in more ways than one.⌋ Kāuś. does not quote the  
verse; but our comm. declares it to accompany the laying of the dead  
body on the cart (for transportation to the funeral pile).

Go forth, go forth upon the homeward pathways whither our sires of old have gone before us. Then shalt thou look on both the Kings enjoying their sacred food, God Varuna and Yama.
