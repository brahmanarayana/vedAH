### Translation
4. What we (pl.) did not do formerly, why \[do that\] now? speaking  
righteousness, should we prate unrighteousness? The Gandharva in the  
waters and the watery woman (*yóṣā*)—that is our (du.) union (*nā́bhi*),  
that our ⌊du.⌋ highest relation (*jāmí*).

### Notes
RV. x. 10. 4 reads *ṛtā́* in **b**, and *sā́ no n-* in **d**, but *nāu* at  
the end. ⌊The inconcinnity of number as between *no* and *nāu* tempts  
one to think that here at least the text of the AV. has scored a point  
against that of the RV. *Ánṛta* seems to be used here, as hardly  
elsewhere, in the directly opposed sense to *ṛtá*. The comm. explains  
*rapema* by *spaṣṭam brūmaḥ*. ⌊Cf. Weber, *Sb.*, p. 825.⌋

Shall we do now what we ne'er did aforetime? we who spoke righteously now talk impurely? Gandharva in the floods, the Dame of Waters--such is our bond, such our most lofty kinship.
