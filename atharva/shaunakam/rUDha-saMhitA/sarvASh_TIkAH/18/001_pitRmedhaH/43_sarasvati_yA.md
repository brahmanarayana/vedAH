### Translation
43. O Sarasvatī, that wentest in company (*sarátham*) with the songs  
(*ukthá*), with the *svadhā́s*, O goddess, reveling with the Fathers,  
assign thou to the sacrificer here a portion of refreshment (*íḍ*) of  
thousandfold value, abundance of wealth.

### Notes
Here, once more, the AV. disturbs the meter by the intrusion into **a**  
of *ukthāís*, which is wanting in the RV. version (x. 17. 8 **a, b**, 9  
**c, d**). ⌊RV. reads *yájamāneṣu* in **d**.⌋ The three Sarasvatī verses  
are repeated below as xviii. 4. 45-47. The comm. gives *annasya* as  
equivalent of *iḍás*.
