### Translation
16. Another man, truly, O Yamī, another man shall embrace thee, as a  
twining plant a tree; either do thou seek his mind or he thine; then  
make for thyself very excellent concord (*samvíd*).

### Notes
RV. x. 10. 14 has for **a** the much better version *anyám ū ṣú tváṁ  
yamy anyá u tvā́m*, and in **b** again *ṣvajāte*. Our D., and a single  
ms. of SPP's (with the comm.), also have *anyam* ⌊at the beginning⌋, and  
SPP. accordingly admits *anyám* into his text, in spite of the absence  
of *tvám*. But the comment on the Prāt. three times (under ii. 97; iii.  
4; iv. 98) reads *anya ū ṣu*, and it cannot well be questioned that this  
is the true text of our AV. Our P.M.E. accent again *yámi*. The Anukr.  
takes no notice of the lacking syllable in **a**; ⌊perhaps it balances  
**c** against **a**⌋.

Embrace another, Yami. Let some other, even as the woodbine rings a tree, enfold thee. Win thou his heart and let him win thy fancy; so make with him a bond of blest alliance.
