### Translation
42. On Sarasvatī do the Fathers call, arriving at the sacrifice on the  
south; sitting on this *barhís* do ye revel; assign thou to us food  
(*íṣas*) free from disease.

### Notes
Here again the RV. version (x. 17. 9 **a, b**, 8 **c, d**) makes the  
meter good by inserting ⌊or rather (cf. vs. 59), by not omitting⌋ *yā́m*  
in **a** before *pitáras* (and hence accenting *hávante*\*); it also  
accents *dakṣiṇā́* in **b**, as other texts do; two of our mss.  
(O.s.m.Op.) do the same, with the majority of SPP's, whence the latter  
adopts *dakṣiṇā́* in his edition; it is undoubtedly the correct reading  
⌊as is explicitly stated also by the comm. to xix. 13. 9, page 325²¹⌋.  
RV. also avoids the change of subject in the second line by reading  
*mādayasva* in **c**. \*⌊It is interesting to note that SPP's C^(P)  
accents *hávante*, as if the missing *yā́m* were not missing: cf. my note  
about "blend-readings" under xiv. 2. 18, and the end of my note under  
xviii. 1. 39; also note to 4. 57.⌋

Sarasvati is called on by the Fathers who come right forward to our solemn worship. Seated upon this sacred grass rejoice you. Give thou us strengthening food that brings no sickness.
