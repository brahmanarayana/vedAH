### Translation
59. Come thou hither with the worshipful An̄girases; revel here, O Yama,  
with the Vāirūpas—I call Vivasvant, who is thy father—sitting down upon  
this *barhís*.

### Notes
The verse is found as RV. x. 14. 5, and in TS. ii. 6. 12⁶ and MS. iv.  
14. 16. All these rectify the meter by inserting ⌊or rather (cf. vs.  
42), by not omitting⌋ *yajñé* after *asmín* in **d**, and they have in a  
the equivalent reading *an̄girobhir ā́ gahi yajñíyebhiḥ*. The AV. version  
is *bṛhatī* ⌊possibly because one can count its **d** as 9 syllables:  
*purābṛhatī* does not seem to occur elsewhere and perhaps it is wrong⌋.

Come, Yama, with Angirases, the holy; rejoice thee here with children of Virupa. Seated on sacred grass at this oblation: I call Vivasvan too, thy father, hither.
