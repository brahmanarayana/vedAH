### Translation
12. What should brother be when there is no protector? or what sister,  
when destruction impends (*ni-gam*)? Impelled by desire, I prate thus  
much; mingle thou thy body with my body.

### Notes
The first half-verse apparently means that the matter of near kindred is  
overborne in importance by the consideration of her loneliness and of  
the necessity for continuing their race. The verse agrees throughout  
with RV. x. 10. 11. The comm. renders *-mūtā* in **c** by *mūrchitā*.
