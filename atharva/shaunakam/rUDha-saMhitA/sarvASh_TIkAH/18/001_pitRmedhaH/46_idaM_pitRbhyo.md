### Translation
46. Be this homage today to the Fathers, who went first, who went after,  
who are seated in the space (*rájas*) of earth, or who are now in  
regions (*díś*) having good abodes (*suvṛjána*).

### Notes
The verse is RV. x. 15. 2, which, however, reads in **b** *úparāsas*,  
and in **d** *vikṣú;* and with it in both respects read the  
corresponding verses in TS. ii. 6. 12⁴ and MS. iv. 10. 6; also VS. xix.  
68 (but this, with our E., has *námo ‘stu* in **a**). Ppp. also gives  
the verse in book ii., reading in **b** *ye parāsaṣ pareyuḥ*, and in  
**d** *suvṛjināsu vikṣu*. Some of our mss. (P.M.I.R.T.), and one of  
SPP's, agree with RV. in reading *úparāsas;* the comm. divides *u  
parāsas;* and our E. has *vikṣú*, while P.M. give *divikṣú*, and I.  
*prikṣú*. For the use of the verse in Kāuś. and Vāit. with vss. 44-45,  
see under 44; it also (or else, more probably, 4. 51: see under that  
verse) is prescribed alone (80. 51) to accompany the scattering of  
*darbha*-grass in preparing the funeral pile.

Now be this homage offered to the Fathers, to those who passed of old and those who followed, Those who have rested in the earthly region and those who dwell among the happy races.
