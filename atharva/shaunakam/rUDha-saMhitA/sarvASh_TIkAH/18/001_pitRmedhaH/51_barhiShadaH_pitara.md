### Translation
51. Ye *barhís*-seated Fathers, hitherward with aid! these offerings  
have we made for you; enjoy \[them\]! do ye come with most wealful aid;  
then assign to us weal \[and\] profit, free from evil.

### Notes
The corresponding RV. verse (x. 15. 4) has *áthā* at beginning of **d**.  
VS. (xix. 55) agrees throughout with RV.; TS. (in ii. 6. 12²) spoils the  
meter of **d** by changing *nas* to *asmábhyam;* MS. (in iv. 10. 6) has  
at the end *dadhātana;* ⌊so has W's Op.⌋. The comm. also reads *atha*.  
The verse is used by Kāuś. (87. 27), along with 3. 44-46 and 4. 68, to  
accompany the untying and strewing of the *barhis* in the  
*piṇḍapitṛyajña*. In Vāit. 30. 14, it appears with 1. 44, 45 etc. (see  
under 1. 44); and again (9. 8), in the *cāturmāsya* sacrifice,  
accompanying (with 3. 44, 45 and 4. 71) a libation to Soma and the  
Fathers.
