### Translation
37. O companions, we would supplicate (*ā-śas*) worship (*bráhman*) for  
Indra, possessor of the thunderbolt, to praise, indeed, the most manly,  
the daring.

### Notes
The verse is RV. viii. 24. 1 (also SV. i. 390), which reads in **a**  
*śiṣāmahi* (SV. *-he*), and inserts in **c** *vas* after *ū ṣú*, as  
required by the meter. The comm's text (but not his exposition) also has  
the *vas*. Our Anukr. takes no notice of the lack of a syllable in the  
pāda. The comm. explains *ā́ śiṣāmahe* by *āśāsmahe*, and supplies  
*kartum;* he renders *stuṣé* by either *stāumi* or *stotum*. The  
particles *ū ṣú* are included in the prescriptions of Prāt. ii. 97; iii.  
4; iv. 98. ⌊Weber, *Sb.* 1895, p. 819 n., can assign no reason why vss.  
37-38 should appear here.⌋
