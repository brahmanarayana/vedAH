### Translation
10. By nights, by days one may pay reverence (*daśasy*) to him; the  
sun's eye may open (? *ún mimīyāt*) for a moment; with heaven, with  
earth paired, of near connection;—Yamī must bear the unbrotherly  
(*ájāmi*) \[conduct\] of Yama.

### Notes
RV. x. 10. 9 differs from our text only by reading in **d** *bibhṛyāt;*  
and this reading the translation implies, *vivṛhāt* seeming  
unexplainable save as a corruption, suggested by the forms of *vi-vṛh*  
in the two preceding verses. The connection of the verse is very loose,  
and the sense of **b** especially doubtful. One is tempted to emend to  
*mimīlyāt;* but *ā́ mimīyāt* is found in TB. iii. 6. 13 ⌊2d *prāiṣa*⌋,  
explained by its commentary as meaning *āgatya praviśeyuḥ*. Our comm.  
explains? *ún m-* as *úrdhvaṁ gacchet* (the RV. comm. as *ud etu*). Our  
comm. further reads at the end *ajāmis*, and understands it of Yamī. The  
adjectives in **c** are dual; the comm. supplies "earth with heaven and  
heaven with earth." ⌊Cf. Weber, *Sb.*, p. 823.⌋

May Surya's eye with days and nights endow him, and ever may his light spread out before him. In heaven and earth the kindred pair commingle. On Yami be the unbrotherly act of Yama.
