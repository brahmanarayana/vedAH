### Translation
56. Eager (*uśánt*) would we light thee, eager would we kindle; do thou,  
eager, bring the eager Fathers to eat the oblation.

### Notes
The corresponding verse in RV. (x. 16. 12; also VS. xix. 70) has *ní  
dhīmahi* for *idh-* in **a**; TS. (in ii. 6. 12¹) and MS. (in i. 10. 18)  
read instead *havāmahe*, and with these our comm. agrees. Used in Kāuś.  
(87. 19: the comm. says, with vs. 57 also) to accompany, in the  
*piṇḍapitṛyajña*, the lighting of two pieces of wood. ⌊The next vs. is a  
variation of this.⌋

We set thee down with yearning, and with yearning we enkindle thee, Yearning, bring yearning Fathers nigh to eat the food of sacrifice.
