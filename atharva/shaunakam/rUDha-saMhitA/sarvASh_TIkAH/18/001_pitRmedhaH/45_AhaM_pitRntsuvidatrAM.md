### Translation
45. I have won hither (*ā-vid*) the beneficent Fathers, both the  
grandson and the wide-striding of Vishṇu; they who, sitting on the  
*barhís*, partake of the pressed drink with *svadhā́*—they come  
especially hither.

### Notes
The verse is, without variant, RV. x. 15. 3, VS. xix. 56, and found in  
TS. ii. 6. 12³ and MS. iv. 10. 6 (MS. puts *yé* after *svadháyā* in  
**c**). Our comm. is uncertain from which root *vid* to make *avitsi*,  
and casts no light on the obscure second pāda; he renders *āgamiṣṭhās*  
either by *āgamaya* or *āgacchantu*. The abbreviated form *barhiṣádas*  
(p. *barhi॰sádaḥ*) is one of those quoted by the Prāt. comment as aimed  
at by rules ii. 59; iv. 100. For the use of the verse by Kāuś. and  
Vāit., see under vs. 44.

I have attained the gracious-minded Fathers, I have gained son and progeny from Vishnu. They who enjoy pressed juices with oblation, seated on sacred grass, come oftenest hither.
