### Translation
48. Sweet verily is this \[*sóma*\], and full of honey is this; strong  
(*tīvrá*) verily is this, and full of sap is this; and no one soever  
overpowers in conflicts (*āhavá*) Indra, having now drunk of it.

### Notes
The verse is RV. vi. 47. 1, without real variant; its applicability in  
the funeral book is not apparent, and neither Kāuś. nor Vāit. uses it.  
Part of our mss. (O.R.K.), with nearly all SPP's, combine at the  
beginning *svādúṣ k-*, which RV. also has; and SPP., with good reason,  
adopts this in his text.

Yes, this is good to taste and full of sweetness, verily it is strong and rich in flavour. No one may conquer Indra in the battle when he hath drunken of the draught we offer.
