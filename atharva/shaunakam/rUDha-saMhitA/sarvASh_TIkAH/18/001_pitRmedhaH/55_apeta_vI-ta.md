### Translation
55. Go ye away, go asunder, and creep apart from here; for this man the  
Fathers have made this world; adorned with days, with waters, with rays  
(*aktú*), a rest (*avasā́na*) Yama gives to him.

### Notes
The verse is RV. x. 14. 9, without variant; and TA. (in i. 27. 5; vi. 6.  
1) has the first, third, and fourth pādas; while VS. (xii. 45) and TS.  
(in iv. 2. 4¹), TB. (i. 2. 1¹⁶), and MS. (ii. 7. 11), have only the  
first (agreeing with TA. in the second). TA., however, reads *dadātv  
av-* in **d**, and that is found also in our P.M.I. The comm. has for  
**b** the pāda of the other texts: *ye ‘tra stha purāṇā ye ca nūtanāḥ*.  
⌊My discussion of the verse in *Skt. Reader*, p. 378, may be consulted.⌋  
The verse, with 2. 37, accompanies in Kāuś. (So. 42) the sprinkling of  
the place of cremation with holy water; in V^ait. (28. 24), the sweeping  
of the site for the householder's fire, in the *agnicayana* ceremony.  
⌊Weber, *Sb.* 1895, p. 839, takes the verse as a call, addressed to all  
creatures (whether animals or demons) that may infest the resting-place  
of the dead man, to quit the same (averruncatio).⌋  
  
⌊Böhtlingk, in his paper *Ueber esha lokaḥ*, discusses this verse at  
*Ber. der sächsischen Gesell.* for 1893, xlv. 131.—He would read *vī́ta*,  
not *vī̀ta*, referring to Whitney's *Grammar*² § 128, and suggesting that  
*divī̀va* is perhaps the only example for the circumflex; but I have  
noted *vī̀ndra*, RV. x. 32. 2, *vī̀va*, vii. 55. 2, *nī̀ta*, AV. iii. 11.  
2, and *bhindhī̀dám*, vii. 18. 1, and suspect that Whitney has collected  
all the *prāśliṣṭa svaritas* from AV. (nearly a score) in his note to  
the Prāt. iii. 56.⌋

Go hence, depart ye, fly in all directions. This world for him the Fathers have provided. Yama bestow upon this man a dwelling adorned with days and beams of light and waters.
