### Translation
14. Verily, I may not mingle my body with thy body; they call him wicked  
(*pāpá*) who should approach his sister. That is not consonant (?  
*asaṁyát*) with my mind \[and\] heart, that I, a brother, should lie in  
a sister's bed (*śáyana*).

### Notes
The first half-verse ⌊cf. vs. 13⌋ is RV. x. 10. 12 **a, b**, which  
latter, however, reads in **a** *te tanvā̀ tanvàṁ sám*. All the mss.  
leave *śayīya* at the end unaccented, and both editions read  
accordingly; we ought in ours to have made the necessary emendation to  
*śáyīya*. The mss. vary in **c** between *ásaṁyat, asaṁyát, ásaṁyát*,  
and *asaṁyat;* SPP. gives in his text *ásaṁyat*, which is better than  
our *asaṁyát*; the *pada*-text divides *asam॰yat*. The comm. reads  
instead *asuṁ yat*, and supplies a verb, *apaharet*, to govern *asum*.

I will not fold mine arms about thy body: they call it sin when one comes near a sister. Not me--prepare thy pleasure with another. Thy brother seeks not this from thee, O fair one.
