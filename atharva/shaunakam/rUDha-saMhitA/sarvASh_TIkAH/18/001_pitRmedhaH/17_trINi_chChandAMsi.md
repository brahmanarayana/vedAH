### Translation
17. Three meters the poets extended (? *vi-yat*)—the many-formed one,  
the admirable, the all-beholding; waters, winds, herbs—these are set  
(*ā́rpita*) in one being (*bhúvana*).

### Notes
The verse is extremely obscure, in meaning and in connection. The mss.  
vary much as regards the accent of *pururūpam;* two of ours (O.D.) and  
several of SPP's accent *-rū́p-*, which, as it is found in other texts,  
the latter has very properly admitted in his edition. The comm. renders  
*ví yetire* by *yatnaṁ kṛtavantaḥ*. The Anukr. takes no notice of the  
irregularity of the meter. ⌊Concerning this *prakṣipta*-verse,  
"glossenartige Parallelstelle," see Weber, *Sb.* 1895, p. 819 note, and  
p. 828.⌋

Three hymns the Sages have disposed in order, the many-formed, the fair, the all-beholding. These in one single world are placed and settled--the growing plants, the breezes, and the waters.
