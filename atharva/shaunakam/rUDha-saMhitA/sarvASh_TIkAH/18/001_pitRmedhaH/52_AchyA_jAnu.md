### Translation
52. Bending the knee, sitting down on the right, let all assent to  
(*abhi-gṛ*) this libation of ours; injure us not, O Fathers, by reason  
of any offense (*ā́gas*) which we may do to you through humanity.

### Notes
That is, through human frailty. The corresponding RV. verse (x. 15. 6)  
reads for **b** *imáṁ yajñám abhí gṛṇīta víśve;* and VS. (xix. 62)  
agrees with RV.; the comm., too, so far as to have *gṛṇīta*. In Kāuś.  
(83. 28), the verse accompanies the arranging of the bone relics of the  
deceased at their place of burial (repeated, with two other verses, in  
the *piṇḍapitṛyajña*, 87. 28). The Anukr. takes no notice of the  
redundant syllable in **b**.

Bowing their bended knees and seated southward let all accept this sacrifice with favour. Punish us not for any sin, O fathers which we through human frailty have committed.
