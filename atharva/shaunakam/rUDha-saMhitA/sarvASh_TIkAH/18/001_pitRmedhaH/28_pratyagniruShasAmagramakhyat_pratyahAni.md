### Translation
28. Agni hath looked forth to meet the apex of the dawns, to meet the  
days, \[he\] first, Jātavedas, and to meet the rays of the sun in many  
places; to meet heaven-and-earth he stretched out.

### Notes
These two verses we had above as vii. 82. 4, 5. They are here again  
written out in full by two of our mss. (O.R.). ⌊Cf. my introduction,  
above, p. 815.⌋

Agni hath looked against the van of Mornings, against the days- the earliest Jatavedas; In many a place against the beams of Surya, against the heavens and earth hath he extended.
