### Translation
11. Verily there shall come those later ages (*yugá*) in which next of  
kin (*jāmí*) shall do what is unkinly ⌊*ájāmi*⌋. Put thine arm  
underneath a hero (*vṛṣabhá*); seek, O fortunate one, another husband  
than me.

### Notes
The verse is, without variant, RV. x. 10. 10. *Upa barbṛhi* in **c**  
means 'make an *upabárhaṇa* (cushion, pillow) of.' Our comm. regards the  
anomalous *barbṛhi* ⌊*Gram.* § 1011 a⌋ as *barbṛ* + *hi*, *-bṛ-* being  
for *-bṛh-* by Vedic license.

Sure there will come succeeding times when brothers and sisters will do acts unmeet for kinsfolk. Not me, O fair one--seek another husband, and make thine arm a pillow for thy consort.
