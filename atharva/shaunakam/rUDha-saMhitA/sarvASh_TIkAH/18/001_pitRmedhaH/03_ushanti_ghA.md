### Translation
3. Truly those immortals want that—posterity (? *tyajás*) of the one  
mortal; may thy mind be set in our mind; mayest thou enter \[as\]  
husband a wife's body.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The verse shows no variant from RV. x. 10. 3. Bs.E. read in **d**  
*tanvā̀m*. The comm. explains *tyajásam* by *tyāgam, garbhān nirgamanam,  
utpattim*. ⌊Cf. Weber, *Sb.*, p. 824.⌋

Yea, this the Immortals seek of thee with longing, a scion of the only man existing. Then let thy soul and mine be knit together. Embrace thy con- sort as her loving husband.
