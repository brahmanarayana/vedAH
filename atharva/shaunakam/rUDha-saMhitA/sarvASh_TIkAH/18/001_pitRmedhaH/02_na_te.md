### Translation
2. Thy friend wants (*vaś*) not that friendship of thine, that she of  
like sign should become of diverse form; the sons of the great Asura,  
heroes, sustainers of the sky (*dív*), look widely about.

### Notes
That is, Varuna's spies are on the watch against such unpermitted acts.  
Our Bp.Bs. read in **b** *sálakṣmyā*. The comm. understands *salakṣmā*  
as *ekodaratvalakṣaṇaṁ yasyāḥ* 'marked as from the same womb,' and  
*viṣurūpā* as "changing from sister to wife." The same expression occurs  
below in 1. 34, and variations of it in TS. i. 3. 10¹ (quoted further at  
vi. 3. 11²) and MS. i. 2. 17 (a passage corresponding to, but different  
from, that in TS.); also VS. vi. 20 **b** (do.). It seems to have a kind  
of proverbial currency, as applied to things that change from one  
character to another. The comm. renders *pari khyan* by *pari vadanti*  
or *nirākariṣyanti*. The verse is RV. x. 10. 2.

Thy friend loves not the friendship which considers her who is near in kindred as a stranger. Sons of the mighty Asura, the heroes, supporters of the heaven, see far around them.
