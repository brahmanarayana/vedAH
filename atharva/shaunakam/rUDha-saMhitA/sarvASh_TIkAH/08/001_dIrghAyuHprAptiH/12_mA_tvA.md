### Translation
12. Let not the flesh-eating \[fire\] plot against thee; move far from  
the destroying (*sáṁkasuka*) one; let heaven defend, let earth defend  
thee; let both sun and moon defend thee; let the atmosphere defend from  
the gods' missile.

### Notes
Most of the mss. (not our Bp.P.M.I.) read *rákṣatām* in **d**, which  
SPP. accordingly (following all his authorities) retains, though the  
accent is not defensible. ⌊I can find no note to the effect that P.M.I.  
leave *rakṣatām* unaccented.⌋ Ppp. puts pādas **a, b** after **c, d**.  
The comm. reads *saṁkusukāt* in **b**.

Let not the Flesh-Consumer plot against thee: depart thou far away from the Destroyer. Be Heaven and Earth and Sun and Moon thy keepers, and from the dart of Gods may Air protect thee.
