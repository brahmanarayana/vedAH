### Translation
15. Let Vāyu, Indra, Dhātar, the preserving Savitar, assign thee unto  
converse with the living; let not breath, strength, leave thee; we call  
after thy life.

### Notes
The *pada*-text has *sam॰úde* in **a**, and the translation follows this  
(cf. *vy॰úṣi* from root *vas*), as being on the whole probably the  
understanding of the text-makers; if they had seen in the word anything  
of the root *mud*, they would have divided *sa॰múde;* and yet it is very  
likely that it is a corruption for *sam॰múde;* the comm. glosses it with  
*sammodāya*, as if the reading were *sammúde*. No variant from Ppp. is  
noted. The comm. divides our 15-17 into two long verses, ending 15 with  
*kathā́ syāḥ*. His intention seems to be to make just twenty verses of  
the hymn.

May saving Savitar, Vayu, Indra, Dhatar restore thee to com- munion with the living. Let not thy vigour or thy breath forsake thee: we recall thy life.
