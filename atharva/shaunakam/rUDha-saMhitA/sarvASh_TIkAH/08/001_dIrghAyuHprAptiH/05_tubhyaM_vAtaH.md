### Translation
5. Let the wind, Mātariśvan, be cleansing for thee; for thee let the  
waters rain immortal things; may the sun burn weal for thy body; let  
death compassionate thee; do not thou perish.

### Notes
*Pavatām* 'be cleansing' might properly enough be rendered simply  
'blow.'

Purely for thee breathe Wind and Matarisvan, and let the Waters rain on thee their nectar. The Sun shall shine with healing on thy body; Death shall have mercy on thee: do not leave us!
