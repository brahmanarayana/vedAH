### Translation
2. Up hath Bhaga taken him, up Soma rich in shoots ⌊hath taken⌋ him, up  
the heavenly Maruts ⌊have taken⌋ him, up have Indra-and-Agni, for his  
welfare.

### Notes
Or *aṅśumant* means 'rich in rays,' Soma having its secondary sense of  
'moon': both were probably in the author's mind.
