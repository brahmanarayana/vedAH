### Translation
8. Do not regard (*ā-dhī*) the departed, who lead \[one\] to the  
distance; ascend out of darkness, come to light; we take hold on thy  
hands.

### Notes
Ppp. begins **c** with *ud ā roha*, which makes the pāda a good  
*triṣṭubh;* the omission of *e ’hi* would rectify it to an *anuṣṭubh*.  
The comm. omits *e ’hi*. Ppp. also reads *hastam* in **d**. ⌊With **b**,  
cf. v. 30. 12 **b**.⌋

Yearn not for the departed ones, for those who lead men far away. Rise up from darkness into light: come, both thy hands we clasp in ours.
