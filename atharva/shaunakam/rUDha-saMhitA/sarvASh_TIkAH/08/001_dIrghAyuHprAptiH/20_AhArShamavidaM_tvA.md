### Translation
20. I have taken, I have found thee; thou hast come back renewed;  
whole-limbed one! I have found thy whole sight, and thy whole life-time.

### Notes
The verse is RV. x. 161. 5, which has another *tvā* after *ā́ ’hārṣam* in  
**a**, and the voc. *punarnava* ⌊with unlingualized *n*⌋ at end of  
**b**, with both of which variants the comm. agrees, while Ppp. also  
gives the former. ⌊For the lingualized *ṇ*, see Prāt. iii. 82.⌋

I have attained and captured thee: thou hast returned restored to youth. Perfect in body: so have I found all thy sight and all thy life.
