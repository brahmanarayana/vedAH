### Translation
11. Let the fires that are within the waters defend thee; let that  
defend thee which human beings kindle; let Vāiśvānara, Jātavedas defend  
\[thee\]; let not \[the fire\] of heaven consume thee along with the  
lightning.

### Notes
Our text should read in **d** *mā́ prá dhāk;* the omission of *prá* is an  
error of the press. Ppp. reads *mā pra dahāt.*

Thy guardians be the Fires within the Waters, thy guardian be the Fire which men enkindle. Thy guardian be Vaisvanara Jatavedas; let not celestial Fire with lightning burn thee.
