### Translation
9. Let not the dark and the brindled one, sent forth, \[seize\] thee,  
that are Yama's dogs, road-defenders; come thou hitherward; do not  
hesitate; stand not there with mind averted.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *mā ’va* for *mā vi* in **c**. The comm. omits *préṣitāu* in  
**a**; he ⌊twice⌋ supplies *bādhatām* as the missing verb in **a**.
