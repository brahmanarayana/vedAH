### Translation
20. The divine amulet hath ascended me, in order to great unharmedness;  
enter ye together unto this post (? *methí*), body-protecting,  
thrice-defending, in order to vigor (*ójas*).

### Notes
Ppp. reads *tvā* instead of *mā* in **a**, and *enyam* instead of  
*methim* in **c**. The comm. questions whether *mahyāi* in **b** means  
*mahatyāi* or *mahyam!* The difficult and doubtful second half-verse  
puzzles him (as us) greatly: first he regards 'men' as addressed (*he  
narāḥ*), and takes *methi* as 'a stirrer-up, a destroyer of enemies,' or  
alternatively as a post in a threshing floor (*methī khale yatho ’cchirā  
vartata evam ayam api ’ti;* or, secondly, the gods are addressed, and  
*methi* means an amulet representing such a post (*methīsthānīyam  
maṇim*).

Let the Gods' Charm be bound on me to keep me safe from every ill. Come ye and enter all within this pillar, the safe-guard of the body, thrice-defended.
