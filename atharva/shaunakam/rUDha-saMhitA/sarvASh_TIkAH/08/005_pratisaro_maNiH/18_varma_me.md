### Translation
18. A defense for me \[be\] heaven-and-earth, a defense the day, a  
defense the sun, a defense for me both Indra and Agni; a defense let  
Dhātar assign (*dhā*) to me.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Compare AśS. i. 2. 1 ⌊and ĀpśS. xiv. 26. 1⌋ with **a, b**; both  
substitute *agnis* for *ahar*. The verse, as noted above, is wanting in  
Ppp. The comm. omits *me* in **c**. The first half-verse occurs again as  
xix. 20. 4 **a, b**.
