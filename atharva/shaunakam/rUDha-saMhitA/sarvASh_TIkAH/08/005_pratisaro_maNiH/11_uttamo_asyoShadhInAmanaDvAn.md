### Translation
11. Thou art the chief (*uttamá*) of herbs, as the ox of moving  
creatures (*jágat*), as the tiger of wild beasts (*śvápad*); whom we  
sought, him have we found, a watcher near at hand (?).

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The mark of division in this verse is badly placed in our edition; it  
should be after *śvápadām iva*, as in the mss. ⌊and SPP's edition⌋. SPP.  
reads at the end, with all the mss., *ántitam;* the comm. this time (cf.  
the note to vi. 4. 2) gives us our choice between taking it as one word  
(= *atyantasaṁnihitam*) or two (= *tam eva antike*); Ppp. avoids the  
difficulty by reading instead *adhruvam*. To me the emendation to *ánti  
tám* seems unacceptable. The comm. reads before it *pratispāśinam*.  
Prāt. iii. 10 notes the double form *śvápad* and *śvā́pad*. The first  
three pādas are found again below as xix. 39. 4 **a, b, c**; the  
irregular *uttamás* instead of *uttamā́* seems due to the influence of  
the two masculine nouns in the double comparison.

Thou art the chief of all the plants, even as a bull among the beasts. A tiger of the beasts of prey. Him whom we sought for have we found, him lying near in wait for us.
