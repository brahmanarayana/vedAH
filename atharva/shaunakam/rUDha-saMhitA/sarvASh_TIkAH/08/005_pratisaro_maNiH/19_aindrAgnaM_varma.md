### Translation
19. Indra-and-Agni's abundant formidable defense, which not all the gods  
together pierce through—let that, being great, save my body on all  
sides, that I may be long-lived, attaining old age.

### Notes
With **d** compare VS. xxxiv. 52 **d**, which differs from it only by  
reading at the end the irregular form *ásam*. Ppp. has *te* for *me* in  
**c**, and *asat* in **d** ⌊though the pronoun calls for *asas*⌋.

Not all the Gods may pierce, all leagued together, the vast strong shield which Indra gives, and Agni. May that great shield on all sides guard my body, that to full old my life may be extended.
