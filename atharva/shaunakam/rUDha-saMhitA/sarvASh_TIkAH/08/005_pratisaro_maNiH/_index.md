### Comment
Found also (except vs. 18) in Pāipp. xvi. *⌊The Berlin ms. reads -garbhā ”stāra-, which is more nearly right.⌋


⌊Kāuś. uses the hymn, with iii. 5 etc., to accompany the binding on of an amulet in a rite (19. 22) for general prosperity; and again, with ii. 11 etc., in a rite (39. 7) against witchcraft. It is reckoned (note to 19. 1) to the puṣṭika mantras. To the svastyayana gaṇa (note to 25. 36) are reckoned vs. 18 (not 15: and probably not xix. 20. 4, which has the same pratīka as 18) and its fellow vs. 19; and to the abhaya gaṇa (note to 16. 8), vs. 22. The comm. cites from Nakṣ. Kalpa (19) the use of the hymn in a mahāśānti called rāudrī. Vāit. passes the hymn unnoticed.⌋
