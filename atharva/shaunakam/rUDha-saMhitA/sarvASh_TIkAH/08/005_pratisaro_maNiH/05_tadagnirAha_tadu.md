### Translation
5. This Agni says, this also Soma says, this Brihaspati, Savitar, Indra;  
let these gods, my representatives (*puróhita*), drive the witchcrafts  
backward with the reverters.

### Notes
In this verse and the next, Ppp. has the better reading *pratisareṇa*  
for *-rāis* in **d**. The first half-verse is found again below as xix.  
24. 8 **c, d**. ⌊Cf. also MS. i. 5. 3. The first pāda recurs at xvi. 9.  
2.⌋

This Agni hath declared, Soma declared it, Brihaspati, and Savitar, and Indra. So may these Gods whom I have set before me oppose with saving charms and banish witchcraft.
