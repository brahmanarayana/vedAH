### Translation
9. The witchcrafts that are of the An̄girases, the witchcrafts that are  
of the Asuras, the witchcrafts that are self-made, and those that are  
brought by others—let these, of both kinds, go away to the distances,  
across ninety navigable \[streams\].

### Notes
'Self-made' (*svayaṁkṛta*), doubtless 'made by ourselves'; the comm. so  
understands. 'Navigable'—i.e. not to be crossed without the help of a  
boat. SPP's mss. do not punctuate between **b** and **c**, but the comm.  
does so, like our edition. Ppp. combines *kṛtyā ”n̄girasīr*, has for  
**b** *yāḥ kṛtyā ”surīr uta* (the addition rectifying the meter), and  
combines in **f** *nāvyā ’ti;* and in **c** it puts *yās* after  
*kṛtyās*.
