### Translation
14. Kaśyapa created thee; Kaśyapa collected thee; Indra bore thee in  
human wise (?); bearing \[thee\], he conquered in the conflict (?); the  
amulet, of thousand-fold might, the gods made their defense.

### Notes
The obscure *mā́nuse*, in **c**, the comm. explains as ⌊a collective⌋ =  
*mānuṣeṣu madhye;* he reads in **d** *saṁ̧śreṣaṇe*, which is much more  
acceptable; one is inclined also to conjecture *saṁśeṣíṇo ‘jayat*. Ppp.  
brings no help, only reading *abadhnata* for *akṛṇvata* at the end.  
  
⌊The comm. reckons our **e, f** as a separate verse, the 5th of his  
"decad," thus making this "decad" come out with 13 vss. (instead of  
22—10 = 12, as in the Berlin ed.).⌋

Kasyapa formed and fashioned thee, Kasyapa raised and sent thee forth. Indra wore thee, and, wearing thee, won in the wrestling-match with man. The Amulet of boundless might the Gods have made a coat of mail.
