### Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xvi. (with exchange of order between 4 and 5, and between 19 and 20). It is, with no change of order of verses, and with only few and insignificant variants, RV. vii. 104; not a verse occurs further in any other text, so far as known.


⌊No ritual use of the hymn is prescribed either by Kāuś. or by Vāit. But the comm. regards this hymn as used with the preceding one in a variety of practices: see h. 3.⌋


### Translations
Translated: by the RV. translators; and as AV. hymn by Henry, 10, 47; Griffith, i. 396.
