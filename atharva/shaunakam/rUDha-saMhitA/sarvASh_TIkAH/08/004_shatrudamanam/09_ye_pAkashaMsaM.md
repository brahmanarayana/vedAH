### Translation
9. They who distract (*vi-hṛ*) with \[their\] courses him of simple  
intent, or who spoil at their will (*svadhā́bhis*) what is excellent—let  
Soma either deliver them up to the serpent, or let him set them in the  
lap of perdition.

### Notes
The comm. declares *svadhā* in **b** an *annanāma*, and renders  
*svadhābhis* by *annāir nimittabhūtāiḥ*, 'for food'! An accent-mark is  
wanting in our text over the *ya* of *dūṣáyanti* in **b**.

Those who destroy, as is their wont, the simple, and with their evil natures harm the righteous, May Soma give them over to the serpent, or to the lap of Nirriti consign them.
