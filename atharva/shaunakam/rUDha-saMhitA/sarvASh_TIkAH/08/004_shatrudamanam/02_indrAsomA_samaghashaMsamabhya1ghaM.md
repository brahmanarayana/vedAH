### Translation
2. O Indra-and-Soma, against ⌊*abhí*⌋ the evil-plotter, the evil, let  
heat boil all up ⌊*sam-yas*⌋ like a fiery pot; assign unavoidable hate  
unto the brahman-hating, flesh-eating *kimīdín* of terrible aspect.

### Notes
The construction and meaning of the first half-verse are doubtful; the  
comm. glosses *yayastu* with simple *gacchatu*. RV. has *agnivā́ṅ*  
instead of *-mā́ṅ* in **b**. In our edition, the accent-sign which should  
stand under *gni* in this word has slipped to the right, under *māṅ*.  
⌊Here W. seems to take *sam* as intensive and to render its force by  
"all up." Neither in BR. nor in the *Index* is it joined with *yas:* but  
cf. *saṁ-yāsa*.⌋

Let sin, Indra and Soma! round the wicked boil, like as a cald- ron set amid the flames of fire. Against the foe of prayer, eater of gory flesh, the fearful-eyed Kimidin, keep perpetual hate.
