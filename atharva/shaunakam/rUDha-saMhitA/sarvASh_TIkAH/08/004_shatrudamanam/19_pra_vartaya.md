### Translation
19. Cause the stone to roll forth from the sky, O Indra; \[it,\]  
sharpened by Soma, do thou wholly sharpen, O liberal one; from before,  
from away, from below, from above, do thou smite upon the demoniacs with  
a mountain.

### Notes
RV. reads in **a** *áśm-* after *divó*, and some of SPP's authorities do  
the same. RV. has also *prā́ktād ápāktād* and *údaktād* in **c**; the  
directions admit also of being understood as from east, west, south, and  
north.

Hurl down from heaven thy bolt of stone, O Indra: sharpen it, Maghavan, made keen by Soma. Forward, behind, and from above and under, smite down the demons with thy rocky weapon.
