### Translation
21. Indra was the crusher-away of the familiar demons (*yātú*), of the  
oblation-disturbers, of them who strive to win upon \[it\]; let the  
mighty one (*śakrá*) attack them that are demoniacs as an ax the woods,  
splitting \[them\] like vessels.

### Notes
RV. reads *eti* in **d**, and no small share of the AV. mss. (the  
majority of SPP's) do the same (including our P.s.m.I.D.R.p.m.Kp.); both  
editions give *etu*. The AV. *pada*-text, like the RV., divides and  
accents in **b** *abhí: ā॰vívāsatām*. The Petersburg Lexicons treat the  
*abhi* as if in direct combination with the participle; and they  
translate 'approach with hostile intent,' which is highly arbitrary. The  
comm. gives no aid, rendering simply *abhimukhaṁ gacchatām*. Ppp. reads  
in **b** *-matīnām*. ⌊W. would probably have changed "crusher-away" to  
"demolisher" on the revision.⌋

Indra hath ever been the fiends' destroyer who spoil oblations of the Gods' invokers. Yea, Sakra, like an axe that splits the timber, assails and sma- shes them like earthen vessels.
