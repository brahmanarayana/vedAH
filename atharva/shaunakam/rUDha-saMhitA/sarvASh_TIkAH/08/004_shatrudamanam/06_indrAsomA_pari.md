### Translation
6. O Indra-and-Soma, be there about you on all sides this prayer  
(*matí*), as a girth \[about\] two vigorous (*vājín*) horses, the  
invocation (*hótrā*) that I send forth to you with wisdom; these acts of  
worship (*bráhman*) quicken ye like two lords of men.

### Notes
RV. reads in **d** *nṛpátī ’va*, as the meter demands, and so do our  
P.M.W.R.T.K. and part of SPP's authorities, also the comm., and Ppp.,  
and this is, almost beyond question, the true text; but SPP. adopts in  
his edition *nṛpátī iva*, with the remainder (a majority) of his  
*saṁhitā* authorities. The *pada*-reading is probably *nṛpátī ivé ’ti  
nṛpátī॰iva*, as all the *pada*-mss. except our Bp. (both copies) appear  
to read, and as the RV. *pada* reads; but we should altogether expect  
*nṛpátī ’vé ’ti nṛpátī॰iva*, as Bp. reads. The anomaly of the addition  
of *iti* after *iva* instead of after *nṛpátī* (first time) is noted in  
Prāt. i. 82 c; the Prāt. takes no notice of the exceptional combination  
*nṛpatī ’va*—which is, to be sure, an argument against its right to  
stand in the *saṁhitā*-text: see note to Prāt. iii. 33. The retention of  
dental *n* in *hinómi* after *pari* is prescribed by Prāt. iii. 88. Ppp.  
reads instead *pra hiṇomi*. ⌊Cf. Geldner, *Ved. Stud.* ii. 134.⌋
