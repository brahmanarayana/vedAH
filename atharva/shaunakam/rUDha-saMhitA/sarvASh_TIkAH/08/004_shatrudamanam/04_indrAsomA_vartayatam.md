### Translation
4. O Indra-and-Soma, cause to roll (*vṛt*) from the sky the deadly  
weapon, from the earth also, a shattering for the evil-plotter; shape  
out from the mountains (*párvata*) the noisy one, wherewith ye burn down  
the increasing demon.

### Notes
The comm. glosses *svaryà* with *svaraṇārha*. Ppp. has the easier  
reading *pra harataṁ* for *vartayatam* in **a**.

Indra and Soma, hurl your deadly crushing bolt down on the wicked fiend from heaven and from the earth. Yea, fashion from the big clouds your celestial dart wherewith ye burn to death the waxing demon race.
