### Translation
15. May I die today if I am a sorcerer, or if I have burnt (*tap*) a  
man's lifetime; then let him be divided from ten heroes who vainly says  
to me "thou sorcerer."

### Notes
The comm. glosses *vīrāis* with *putrāis*, which is probably its virtual  
meaning: 'may he lose ten heroic sons.' Our *pada*-text differs from  
that of RV. by dividing *daśá॰bhiḥ* in **c**. Ppp. reads *pāuruṣasya* in  
**b**.

So may I die this day if I have harassed any man's life, or if I be a demon. Yea, may he lose all his ten sons together who with false tongue hath called me Yatudhana.
