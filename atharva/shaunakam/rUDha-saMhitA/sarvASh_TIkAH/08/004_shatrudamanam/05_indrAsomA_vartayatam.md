### Translation
5. O Indra-and-Soma, cause \[it\] to roll forth from the sky; with  
fireheated, stone-smiting, unaging heat-weapons do ye pierce the  
devourers in the abyss; let them go to silence.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *divas* for *yuvam* in **b**; the comm. has in **d**  
*niḥsvaram*, which would be a good reading, but is against the  
*pada*-texts of both RV. and AV. (*ni॰svarám*).

Indra and Soma, cast ye downward from the sky your deadly bolts of stone burning with fiery flame, Eternal, scorching darts. Plunge the voracious fiends within the depth, and let them pass without a sound.
