### Translation
20. Here fly these dog-sorcerers (*śváyātu*); Indra the unharmable they  
the harm-seeking seek to harm; the mighty one (*śakrá*) sharpens his  
deadly weapon for the treacherous ones (*píśuna*); now may he let fly  
(*sṛj*) the thunderbolt at the sorcerers (*yātumánt*).

### Notes
The epithets like *śváyātu* in this verse and below in vs. 22 seem by  
their accent (and by comparison with *yātumánt* and *yātudhā́na*) to  
signify strictly 'one having a dog (etc.) for his familiar demon.' The  
comm. glosses with *śvarūpadhāriṇaḥ śvasahitā* \[*vā*\]. Ppp. combines  
at end of **b** *-vo adābhyam*.

They fly, the demon dogs, and, bent on mischief, fain would they harm indomitable Indra. Sakra makes sharp his weapon for the wicked: now let him cast his bolt at fiendish wizards.
