### Translation
16. Whoever to me that am no sorcerer (*áyātu*) says "thou sorcerer," or  
whatever demoniac says "I am pure (*śúci*)"—let Indra smite him with a  
great deadly weapon; may he fall lowest of every creature.

### Notes
*Áyātu* doubtless literally 'that have no *yātú* or familiar demon'  
(though the proper accent in such case would be *ayātú*), opposite of  
*yātumánt* 'possessing such a *yātú*,' or *yātudhā́na* 'holding or  
containing such.'

May Indra slay him with a mighty weapon, and let the vilest of all creatures perish, The fiend who says that he is pure, who calls me a demon though devoid of demon nature.
