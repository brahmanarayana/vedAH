### Translation
23. Let not the sorcerous demon reach us; let the *kimīdíns* that are  
paired fade away; let the earth protect us from earthly distress, let  
the atmosphere protect us from heavenly.

### Notes
RV. reads, in **a, b**, *yātumā́vatām ápo ’chatu mithunā́ yā́ kimīdínā*.  
Ppp. has *kimādinām*. The comm. glosses *apo ’chantu* with simple *apa  
gacchantu*. The *pada*-division of *yāt-* in **a** is *yātu॰mā́vat* both  
in AV. and in RV.; the word is the subject of Prāt. iv. 8.

Let not the fiend of witchcraft-workers reach us: may Dawn. drive off the couples of Kimidins. Earth keep us safe from earthly woe and trouble! From grief that comes from heaven Mid-air preserve us!
