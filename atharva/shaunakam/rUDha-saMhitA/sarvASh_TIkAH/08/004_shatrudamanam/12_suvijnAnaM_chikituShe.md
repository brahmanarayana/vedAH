### Translation
12. It is easy of understanding for a knowing man (*jána*) \[that\] true  
and untrue words (*vácas*) are at variance; of them what is true,  
whichever is more right, that Soma verily favors; he smites the untrue.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *paspṛśāte* at end of **b**.

The prudent finds it easy to distinguish the true and false: their words oppose each other. Of these two that which is the true and honest Soma protects, and brings the false to nothing.
