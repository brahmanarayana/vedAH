### Translation
17. She who goes forth in the night like an owl (?), hateful, hiding  
herself away—may she fall down into an endless hole (*vavrá*); let the  
\[pressing-\] stones smite the demoniacs with \[their\] noises.

### Notes
RV. again (as in 7 **d**) reads *druhā́* for *druhús* in **b**; also  
*vavrā̈ṅ anantā́ṅ áva* in **c**. Ppp. reads *dūhas* in **b**; and the  
comm. has *upa* instead of *apa*. He glosses *khargálā* with *ulūkī*.

She too who wanders like an owl at night-time, hiding her body in her guile and malice, May she fall downward into endless caverns. May press-stones with loud ring destroy the demons.
