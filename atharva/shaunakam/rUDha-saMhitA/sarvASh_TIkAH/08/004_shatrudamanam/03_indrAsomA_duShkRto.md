### Translation
3. O Indra-and-Soma, pierce ye the evil-doers within their hiding-place  
(*vavrá*), in untenable darkness, whence there shall not come up again  
any one soever of them; be that your furious might unto overpowering.

### Notes
RV. reads at beginning of **c** *yáthā nā́ ’taḥ pún-*. In our edition  
read *duṣkṛ́to* in **a**.

Indra and Soma, plunge the wicked in the depth, yea, cast them into darkness that hath no support, So that not one of them may ever thence return: so may your wrathful might prevail and conquer them.
