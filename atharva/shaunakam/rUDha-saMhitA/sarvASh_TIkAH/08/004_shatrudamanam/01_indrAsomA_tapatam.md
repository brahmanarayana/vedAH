### Translation
1. O Indra-and-Soma, burn the demon, oppress (*ubj*) \[him\]; put  
(*arpay-*) down, ye two bulls, them that thrive in darkness; crush away,  
scorch down the fools (*acít*); slay, push, pin (*śā*) down the  
devourers.

### Notes
*Tamovṛ́dh* may be (so Ludwig) 'increaser of darkness.' The comm. has  
nothing better than *hiṅs* to suggest for *ubj*.

Indra and Soma, burn, destroy the demon foe! Send downward, O ye Bulls, those who add gloom to gloom. Annihilate the fools, slay them and burn them up: chase them away from us, pierce the voracious fiends.
