### Translation
13. Soma by no means furthers the wicked \[man\], nor the *kshatríya*  
who maintains \[anything\] falsely; he smites the demon; he smites the  
speaker of untruth; both lie within reach of Indra.

### Notes

Never doth Soma aid and guide the wicked or him who falsely claims the Warrior's title. He slays the fiend and him who speaks untruly: both lie entan- gled in the noose of Indra.
