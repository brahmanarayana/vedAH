### Translation
4. The spreading, the bushy, the one-spathed, the extending herbs do I  
address; those rich in shoots, jointed (*kāṇḍín*), that have spreading  
branches (*víśākha*); I call for thee the plants that belong to all the  
gods, formidable, giving life to men.

### Notes
*Viśākha* might also signify 'branchless.' Ppp. reads in **a-b**  
*ekaśṛn̄gāṣ pradhanvatīr*.
