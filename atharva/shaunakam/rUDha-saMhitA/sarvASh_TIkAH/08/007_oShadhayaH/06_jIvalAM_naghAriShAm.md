### Translation
6. The lively, by-no-means-harming, living herb, the non-obstructing,  
up-guiding, flourishing (? *puṣyá*) one, rich in sweets, do I call  
hither, for this man's freedom from harm.

### Notes
Compare 2. 6, with which this agrees in the first two pādas and in most  
of the last two. The mss. again are much at variance as to the reading  
of *naghāriṣā́m;* Bp.P.M.p.m.E.p.m.O. read ⌊Bp. with *-ghā-*⌋  
*naghāṛṣā́m*. ⌊Ppp. reads *naghāriṣām* (as does Berlin ed.) and omits  
*iha* and pāda **e**.⌋ The omission of the obscure *puṣyā́m* would  
rectify the meter; the Pet. Lexx. regard the word as proper name of a  
plant.
