### Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xvi. ⌊with verses 16-19 in the order 16, 18, 19, 17⌋. *⌊The mss. have sāṣṭāviṅśakam.⌋ †⌊The Anukr. omits the definition of vss. 15 (triṣṭubh) and 24 (6-p. jagatī).⌋


⌊Used by Kāuś. in a remedial rite (26. 33, 40, note), "with a gilt and lacquered amulet made [cf. introd. to AV. ii. 9] of splinters of ten kinds of trees " (Keś., p. 32722), against all diseases. In the puṁsavana, vs. 27 accompanies (note to 35.6) the giving of food to the pregnant woman. Vait. prescribes the hymn for use in the sāutrāmaṇī rite (30. 6) when the priest mixes herbs with the surd.
