### Translation
14. Let the tigerish amulet of plants, saving, protecting from  
imprecation, smite far away from us diseases \[and\] all demons.

### Notes
The *pada*-text reads *sárvā* (not *sárvāḥ*) in **c**, and the  
translation follows it. Ppp. has *vyāghro* in **a**, and *asmāt* at the  
end. *Adhi* in **d** is redundant in respect both to sense and to meter.
