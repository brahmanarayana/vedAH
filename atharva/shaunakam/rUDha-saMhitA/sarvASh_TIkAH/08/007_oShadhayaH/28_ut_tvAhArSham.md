### Translation
28. I have taken thee up out of what has five *śalas*, and also out of  
what has ten *śalas*, also out of Yama's fetter, out of all offense  
against the gods.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The Pet. Lexx. explain *-śala* 'a certain measure of distance,' but that  
sense does not in the least suit the connection, either here or in TB.  
i. 5. 10¹. Ppp. reads *ahāriṣam* in **a**, ⌊*ut tvā* for *atho* in  
**c**,⌋ and, for **d**, *oṣadhībhir apīparam*. The second half-verse is  
identical with vi. 96. 2 **c, d**, above ⌊and nearly identical with RV.  
x. 97. 16 **c, d**⌋.  
  
⌊Here ends the seventh *artha-sūkta*, with 28 verses. The quoted Anukr.  
says *sa saptamaṁ vṛddhiviṅśatim ṛco ’ṣṭa cā ’parāḥ* (unclear).⌋
