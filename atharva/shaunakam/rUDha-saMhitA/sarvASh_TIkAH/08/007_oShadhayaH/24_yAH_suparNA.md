### Translation
24. What \[herbs\] of the An̄girases the eagles \[know\], what heavenly  
ones the *ragháṭs* know, what ones the birds, the swans know, and what  
all the winged ones, what herbs the wild beasts know—those I call to aid  
for him.

### Notes
*Ragháṭ* (which *divyā́s* 'heavenly' might also qualify) is elsewhere  
unknown; Ppp. reads instead *vagh-*; the major Pet. Lex. suggests  
emendation ⌊apparently withdrawn in the minor: see *ragháṭ*⌋ to  
*raghávas* 'swift'; Ludwig conjectures 'bees.' Ppp. also combines  
*suparṛā ”n̄g-* in **a**. ⌊Render *haṅsā́s* by the prosaic 'geese,' since  
the poetic tone of the AV. is not so elevated as to make that version  
intolerable. Cf. JAOS. xix., 2d half, p. 154.⌋
