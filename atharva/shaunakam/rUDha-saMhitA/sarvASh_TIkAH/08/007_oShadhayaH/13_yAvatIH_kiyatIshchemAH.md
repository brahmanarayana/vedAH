### Translation
13. However many \[may be\] these herbs upon the earth, let them,  
thousand-leafed, free me from death, from distress.

### Notes
All the mss. leave *oṣadhīs* unaccented at end of **b**; and most (all  
save P.M.D.R.T.) accent *-parṇyás* at end of **c**. ⌊Cf. Caland, KZ.  
xxxi. 265.⌋
