### Translation
10. Releasing, free from Varuṇa, formidable, that are poison-spoiling,  
also *balā́sa*-dispelling, and that are witchcraft-spoiling—let those  
herbs come hither.

### Notes
'Free from Varuṇa': i.e., doubtless, 'freeing from the bonds of Varuṇa,'  
with which he visits guilt on the guilty. Ppp. reads in **c-d**  
*balāsanāśinī rakṣonāśanīṣ kṛtyād-*. Read in our text *kṛtyāduṣaṇīś*  
(for *-yad-*) in **d**.
