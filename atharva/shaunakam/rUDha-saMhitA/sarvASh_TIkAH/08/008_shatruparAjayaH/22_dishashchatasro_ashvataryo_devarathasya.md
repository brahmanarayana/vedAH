### Translation
22. The four quarters \[are\] the she-mules of the god-chariot; the  
sacrificial cakes \[are\] the hoofs, the atmosphere the seat (?  
*uddhí*), heaven-and-earth the two sides, the seasons the reins, the  
intermediate directions the attendants, speech the rim (? *párirathya*).

### Notes
Ppp. reads *śaphā ’ntarikṣa buddhiḥ* and omits the clause *antardeśāḥ  
kiṁkarāḥ*. The verse is quoted in Kāuś. 15. 11 ⌊see introd.⌋.

The mules of the Gods' car are heaven's four quarters; their hooves are sacred cakes, the air its body. Its sides are Heaven and Earth, its reins the Seasons, Voice is its hood, its grooms are sky's mid-regions.
