### Translation
7. Great, O Indra, hero (*śū́ra*), is the net of thee that art great,  
that art worth a thousand, that hast hundred-fold heroism; therewith  
encircling the army of the barbarians, the mighty one slew a hundred, a  
thousand, ten thousand, a hundred million.

### Notes
The translation follows Ppp. (see under the preceding verse) in reading  
*senām* at the end. Instead of our **c, d**, Ppp. has *tena ny ubja  
maghavann amitrāṅ śaśvatībhyaḥ.*
