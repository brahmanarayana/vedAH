### Translation
15. The Gandharvas and Apsarases, the serpents, the gods, the  
pure-folks, the Fathers, those seen, those unseen I despatch, that they  
may slay yonder army.

### Notes
Ppp. makes *devān* and *sarpān* change places ⌊and reads *hatāṁ* again  
at the end⌋. ⌊Muir, v. 296, cites MBh. ii. 11. 45 = 461, where the  
Fathers are divided into seven troops, four of embodied and three of  
bodiless.⌋
