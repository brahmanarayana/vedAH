### Translation
3. Crush yonder men out, O *aśvattá;* devour (*khād*) them speedily, O  
*khadirá;* let them be suddenly ⌊*tājád*⌋ broken ⌊*bhāñj*⌋ like hemp  
*bhán̄ga*⌋; let the slayer (*vádhaka*) slay (*han*) them with deadly  
weapons (*vadhá*).

### Notes
The translation implies the emendation (which is made in our text) of  
ajiram (p. khadira॰jiram!) to *-rám,*\* and the treatment of *tāját* and  
*bhán̄gas* (p. *tājádbhán̄gḥ॰iva!*) as two separate words. Ppp. reads in  
**b** *khadirā ’ciram*, and in **c** combines *bhan̄gāi ’va;* for **d**  
it has *bṛhajjālena saṁcitāḥ* ⌊cf. our 4 **d**⌋. Kāuś. (16. 14) takes  
*tājadbhan̄ga* as a single word, and its comm. explains it as the  
castor-oil plant (*eraṇḍa*). ⌊In *śṛṇīhi* I see an allusion to the  
sorcerer's favorite "reeds" (*śará*) of vs. 4. Griffith notes the power  
of the *aśvattha* to rend asunder the masonry etc. in whose crevices its  
seed has germinated. The other word-plays, including that on *vádhaka  
badhaka* (cf. *bādhaka* and root *bādh*), are evident. See also introd.⌋  
\*⌊So also SPP. with several of his authorities.⌋

Asvattha, rend those men; do thou devour them quickly, Khadira! Like reeds let them be broken through, down-smitten by a lifted rush.
