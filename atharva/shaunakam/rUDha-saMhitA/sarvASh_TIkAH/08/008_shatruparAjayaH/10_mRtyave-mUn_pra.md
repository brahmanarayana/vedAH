### Translation
10. To death do I deliver those yonder; with fetters of death \[are\]  
they bound (*sā*); the sad messengers that are death's—them I lead them  
to meet, having bound (*bandh*) \[them\].

### Notes
Ppp. reads *khālās* for *aghalās* in **c**, and at the end *baddhān*.  
All our mss. agree in giving the abbreviated form *badhvā́*. ⌊"Fetters":  
cf. introd.⌋
