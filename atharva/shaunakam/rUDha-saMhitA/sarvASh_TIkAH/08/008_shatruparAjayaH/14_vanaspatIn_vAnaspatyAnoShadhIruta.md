### Translation
14. The forest trees, them of the forest trees, the herbs and the  
plants, what is biped, what is quadruped I despatch (*iṣ*), that they  
may slay yonder army.

### Notes
'Them of the forest trees,' *vānaspatyān*, acc. pl. masc.; the  
lexicographers explain the word to mean 'fruit tree with conspicuous  
flowers.' At the end both of this verse and of the next, Ppp. reads  
*hatāṁ*. Bp. reads *dvi॰pát* in **c**. ⌊For the citation in Kāuś. 73. 5,  
see introd.⌋
