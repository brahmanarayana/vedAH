### Translation
11. Lead ye them, O messengers of death; O messengers of Yama, restrain  
(*apa-umbh*) \[them\]; be they slain to more than thousands; let Bhava's  
club (? *matyà*) shatter them.

### Notes
Ppp. reads for **a** *mṛtyudūtā amuṁ nayata;* **d** is corrupt, but  
apparently is the same with our **d**.

Bear them away, Death's messengers! envoys of Yama! bind them fast. More than a thousand be their slain: the club of Bhava pierce them through!
