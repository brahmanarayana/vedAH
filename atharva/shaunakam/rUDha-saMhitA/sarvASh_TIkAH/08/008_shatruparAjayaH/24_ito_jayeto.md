### Translation
24. On this side conquer thou; on this side conquer away, conquer  
completely, conquer; hail! let these here conquer, let those yonder be  
conquered; hail ⌊*svā́hā*⌋ to these! wail (*duráhā*) to those! with the  
blue-red one I stretch down upon them yonder.

### Notes
That is, probably, with śiva's aid I bring the net down upon them. ⌊Ppp.  
omits all after the first *svā́ha*.⌋ Parts of the verse are quoted in  
Kāuś. 16. 18-20: 'with "hail to these" he makes a libation for his  
friends; with "wail to those" \[he pours\] with the left hand *in̄giḍa*  
on the \[staff\] of *badhaka;* having stuck in a branch of red  
*aśvattha* north of the fire, having surrounded it with two blue and red  
threads, he pulls it up toward the right with "with the blue-red one"':  
evidently artificial adaptations of ceremonies to the words of the text.  
⌊For the whole matter, see introd.⌋  
  
⌊Here ends the fourth *anuvāka*, with 2 hymns and 52 verses. Here also  
ends the eighth *artha-sūkta*, which begins with *índro manthatu*. The  
quoted Anukr. says *indro manthatu*.⌋

Hence conquer, conquer, Hail! be thou the victor! Let these be conquerors and those be conquered. Good luck to these, ill luck to those men yonder! With the dark-blue-and-red our foes I cover.
