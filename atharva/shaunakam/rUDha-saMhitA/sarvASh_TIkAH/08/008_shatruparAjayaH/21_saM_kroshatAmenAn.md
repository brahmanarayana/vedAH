### Translation
21. Together let heaven-and-earth yell at them; together let the  
atmosphere, along with the deities; let them not find a knower, nor a  
foundation; mutually destroying one another let them go unto death.

### Notes
The second half-verse is identical with vi. 32. 3 **c, d**, above. Ppp.  
puts *enāṅ* before *krośatām*, and adds *ubhe* at the end of **a**.

Let Heaven and Earth roar out in wrath against them, and Air with all the Deities in concert, Let them not find a surety or a refuge, but torn away go down to Death together.
