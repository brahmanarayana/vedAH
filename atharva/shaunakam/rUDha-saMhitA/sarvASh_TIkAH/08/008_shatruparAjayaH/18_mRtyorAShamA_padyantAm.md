### Translation
18. Let them go unto death's burning (?), unto hunger, debility, the  
deadly weapon, fear; by snare (*ákṣu*) and net, O śarva, \[do thou\] and  
Indra slay yonder army.

### Notes
Only P. and R.s.m. have *óṣam*, all the rest *ā́ṣam*, which must  
accordingly be regarded as the traditional text, though unintelligible.  
Fusther emendation to *oṣám* 'quickly' is hardly advisable. Ppp. has  
*oṣam*. Ppp. also differs much in **c, d**: *indrasyā ’ksamālābhyāṁ  
sarva senām amūṁ hatām*. Part of our mss. also (W.O.D.T.) read *sárva*  
in **d**. ⌊Geldner discusses *ákṣu*, Ved. Stud. i. 136.⌋

Their portion be the fire of Death, hunger, exhaustion, slaughter, fear. With your entangling snares and nets, Sarva and Indra! slay that host.
