### Translation
17. The hot drink (*gharmá*) \[is\] kindled with fire, this  
thousand-slaying oblation (*hóma*); both Bhava and the spotted-armed  
one—O śarva, slay ye (two) yonder army.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
All the mss. read *bhávas* at beginning of **c**; our edition emends to  
*bhavás*. The common construction *bhaváś ca...śárva...hatam* (cf. the  
next verse) is much disturbed by the addition of *pṛ́śnibāhus*, which the  
second *ca* forbids to take as a mere epithet. Ppp. reads *sahasraśaḥ*  
and *hatām* at the end of the two lines respectively.

The Gharma hath been warmed with fire: this Homa slays a thousand men. Let Bhava, Prisnibahu, and Sarva destroy that armament.
