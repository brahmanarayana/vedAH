### Translation
2. Let the putrid rope, breathing on \[it\], make yonder army putrid;  
seeing afar smoke, fire, let our enemies set fear in their hearts.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *agniṁ dhāmaṁ* in **c.** The different parts of the verse are  
quoted in Kāuś. 16. 10, 12, 13, where the 'putrid rope' appears to be  
understood as an actual rope which is burnt, and of which the 'smoke'  
and 'fire' are to frighten the foe. It is perhaps quite as likely that  
the ceremony is founded on a crass misinterpretation of the verse, and  
that the 'rope' is a poisonous serpent (as conjectured by Ludwig). The  
omission of *amítrās* in **d** would rectify the meter. ⌊With regard to  
the last and to the whole verse, see the introd.⌋

Let Putirajju with her breath corrupt and putrefy that host, And terror smite our foemen's heart when fire and smoke are seen afar.
