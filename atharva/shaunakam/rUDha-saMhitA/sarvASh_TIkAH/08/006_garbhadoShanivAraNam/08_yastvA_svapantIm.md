### Translation
8. He who surprises (*tsar*) thee sleeping, who tries to harm thee  
waking—them the circling (*pari-kram*) sun hath made to vanish away like  
a shadow.

### Notes
Both translators understand the second half-verse to mean 'them hath the  
*baja* made to vanish, as the sun the shadow,' and the comm. takes it in  
the same way; but, though that may be the virtual sense, it is not what  
the line actually says. Ppp. reads, in **a**, *suptāṁ chinatti*, with  
*ca* for *tvā* in **b**. The comm. has *carati* instead of *tsarati* in  
**a**. Nearly all our mss. (all save D.R.) read *jā́gralim* at end of  
**b**, but SPP. strangely reports no such variant from any of his  
authorities.

Whoever steals to thee asleep or thinks to harm thee when awake,-- These hath it banished, as the Sun travelling round drives shade away.
