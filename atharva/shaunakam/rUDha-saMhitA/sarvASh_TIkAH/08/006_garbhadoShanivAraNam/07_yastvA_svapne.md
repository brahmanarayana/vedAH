### Translation
7. He who lies with (*ni-pad*) thee in sleep, having become \[like\] a  
brother and like a father—them, eunuch-formed, tiara-decked (*tirīṭín*),  
let the *bajá* force (*sah*) from here.

### Notes
*Tirīṭin* = 'womanish,' as wearing a distinctive woman's head-dress; the  
comm., however, paraphrases the word with *antardhānenā ’ṭataḥ*, as if  
from *tiraḥ-aṭin!* Ppp. puts the verse after vs. 8, and reads *suptāṁ*  
for *svapne* in **a**, and, in **c, d**, *vajas taṁ...klībarūpaṁ  
kirīṭinam*. ⌊Cf. RV. x. 162. 5-6 with our vss. 7-8.⌋

Whoever, in thy brother's shape or father's comes to thee in sleep, Let Baja rout and chase them like eunuchs with woman's head- dress on.
