### Translation
17. The bristling, hermit-haired, grinding up, much handling one,  
hastening up, copper-colored, snouted (? *tuṇḍéla*) and *śáluḍa*, pierce  
thou forth with the foot, with the heel, as a kicking cow a pot.

### Notes
Doubtless the concluding word should be *spandanā́*, as given by SPP., in  
accordance, as he claims, with all but two of his authorities. The mss.  
are always so careless and untrustworthy in their distinction of *sp*  
and *sy* that it must be the sense rather than their testimony that  
decides in any case which is the true reading. Ppp. appears to have  
*syandanā*. The combination *upéṣantam* (p. *upa॰éṣantam:* Ppp.  
*upeśantam*) is according to Prāt. iii. 52; the passage is quoted in the  
commentary to that rule: the comm. ⌊and his text⌋ read here *upāiṣ-*.  
The comm. also has *śālaḍam* (Ppp. *śālūḍham*) in **d**, and takes *prá  
vidhya* (Ppp. *pravṛddhi*) in **e** as *pravídhya*, gerund. Further, he  
has *prāsyāt* instead of *pārṣṇyā*, and, at the end, *spandanāt*. His  
verse-division is different from ours, as he reckons **e, f** to vs. 18.  
He explains *marīmṛśam* in **b** as = *punaḥpunar mṛśantam*. Ppp. has,  
for *udumbalaṁ tuṇḍelam, adaraṁ sulatuṇḍenam*.
