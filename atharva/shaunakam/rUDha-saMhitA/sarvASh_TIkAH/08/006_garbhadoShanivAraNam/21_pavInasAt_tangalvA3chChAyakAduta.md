### Translation
21. From the rim-nosed, the *tan̄galvà*, the shady (? *chā́yaka*) and  
naked, from the *kimīdín*, let the brown one protect thee about for  
progeny, for husband.

### Notes
Or *chāyaka* may come from root *chā*, and so signify 'tearing' or the  
like; the comm. reads instead *sāyakāt*. Ppp. has at the beginning  
*pavāinasa tan̄-*.
