### Translation
4. Both the ill-named and the well-named—both seek approach (*saṁvṛ́t*);  
the niggards (*arā́ya*) we smite away; let the well-named seek what is  
woman's (*strāíṇa*).

### Notes
Ppp. reads *icchatām* at end of **b**, and omits the second half-verse.  
The comm. explains *strāiṇam* as *striyāḥ sambandhy an̄gaṁ strīsamūhaṁ  
vā;* he takes *-nāman* from root *nam*. The *ṇ* of *durṇāman* is  
prescribed by Prāt. iii. 84.
