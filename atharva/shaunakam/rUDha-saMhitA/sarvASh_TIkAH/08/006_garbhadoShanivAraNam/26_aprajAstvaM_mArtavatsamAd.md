### Translation
26. Childlessness, still-birth, also crying, guilt (*aghá*), barrenness  
(? *āvayá*)—that do thou attach to \[our\] enemy (*ápriya*), as if  
having made a garland from a tree.

### Notes
Ppp. reads, in **a, b**, *mārtavatsam āmābhrogham agham ānayam*. The  
comm. has, for *agham āvayam*, *aghavāvayam*, and paraphrases it with  
*aghānām pāpānāṁ tatphalabhūtānāṁ duḥkhānāṁ vā ’sakṛd vayanam*. It is  
curious that both *ā-vayam* and *mārta-vatsam* are quoted in the  
commentary to Prāt. iv. 18, as if their second member were 'a *taddhita*  
beginning with *v*.'—⌊Cf. MB. i. 1. 14; MP. i. 4. 11.⌋  
  
⌊Here ends the third *anuvāka*, with 2 hymns and 48 verses. It is also  
the end of the sixth *artha-sūkta*, which begins with *yāú te*. The  
quoted Anukr. says *yāu te*.⌋  
  
    
From this point on, the commentary is wanting until the beginning of  
book xi. 7.

Sterility, and infants' death, and weeping that announceth woe, Dear! lay them on the fiend as thou wouldst pluck a garland from a tree.
