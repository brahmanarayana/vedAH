### Translation
12. They who do not endure yonder sun, burning down from the sky, the  
niggards, buck-clothed, ill-smelling, red-mouthed, the *mákakas*, we  
make to disappear.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Ppp. reads in **c** *rāyaṁ vastavāsino*, and, in **e**, *mṛṣakān* for  
*makakān*. In *bastavāsin*, Weber understands *-vāsin* as 'smelling,'  
the Petersburg Lexicons (also Ludwig alternatively) as 'bleating' (for  
*-vāśin*); the comm. *avicarinavasanān*. ⌊For the verse-sequence in  
Ppp., see above.⌋

All those who cannot bear the Sun who warms us yonder from the sky, Arayas with the smell of goats, malodorous, with bloody mouths, the Makakas we drive afar.
