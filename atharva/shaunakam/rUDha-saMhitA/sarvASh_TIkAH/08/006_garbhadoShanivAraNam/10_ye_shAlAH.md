### Translation
10. They who dance around the dwellings (*śā́lā*) in the evening, making  
donkey-noises—they that \[are\] *kusū́las* (granaries) and *kukṣilás*  
(paunchy), exalted (*kakubhá*), *karúmas, srímas*—these, O herb, with  
thy smell do thou make to disappear scattered.

### Notes
One or two of our mss. (as of SPP's) read *strímāḥ* (I.) or *sṛ́māḥ* (W.)  
at end of **d**, or omit the *visarga* before it (M.s.m.W.O.). Ppp.  
reads, for **c, d**, *kuśūlā yaś ca kukṣulā kakubhā svarasā* (*-ramā?*)  
*sumā;* the comm., for the last two words, has *kharumāḥ śrumāḥ;* he  
interprets *kusūlās* as *kusūlākṛtayas, kukṣilās* as *bṛhatkukṣayas*,  
and *kakubhās* as *arjunavṛkṣavad bhayaṁkarākṛtayas*. ⌊Over "exalted" W.  
has interlined "humped?" As for *sríma*, cf. *sṛ́ma* in OB.⌋
