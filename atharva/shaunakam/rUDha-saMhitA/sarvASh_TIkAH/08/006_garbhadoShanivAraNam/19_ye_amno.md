### Translation
19. They who suddenly make die those that are born, \[who\] lie by the  
bearing \[women\]—the Gandharvas, woman-seekers (?), let the brown one  
drive, as the wind a cloud.

### Notes
Ppp. begins *ye sto j-*, and ends *abhrāi vātāi ’va rājatu*. The comm.  
explains *amnojātān* as = *ardhotpannān*. The Prāt., ii. 52, expressly  
prescribes that the final of *amnáḥ* is not ⌊convertible into⌋ *r*—which  
seems a plain acknowledgment that at a later period the word was treated  
as being *amnár*.

Those who kill infants unawares, and near the new-made mothers lie, Let Pinga chase the amorous Gandharvas as wind chases cloud.
