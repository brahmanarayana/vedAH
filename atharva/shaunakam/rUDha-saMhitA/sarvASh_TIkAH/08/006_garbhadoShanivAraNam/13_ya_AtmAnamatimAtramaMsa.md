### Translation
13. They who, putting their excessive self on the shoulder, carry  
\[it\], thrusters-forth of women's hips—O Indra, make the demons  
disappear.

### Notes
The comm. has several different explanations of the first half-verse,  
the translators as many more; a literal rendering seems admissible  
enough. Ppp. reads for **b** *ahiṁ mādhāya bibhrati*.

All those who on their shoulders bear a head of monstrous magnitude, Who pierce the women's loins with pain,--those demons, Indra drive away!
