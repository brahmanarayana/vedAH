### Translation
6. The after-snuffling, fore-feeling, and the much-licking flesh-eater,  
the niggards, the dog-*kiṣkins*, hath the brown *bajá* made to  
disappear.

### Notes
Ppp. reads, for **c**, *rāyaś śukaṣkiṇaṁ;* the comm. has *ca kiṣkiṇas*  
(for *śvakiṣ-*); and he explains *kiṣkin* to mean either 'uttering the  
sound *kiṣ kiṣ*,' or 'constantly injuring' (from the root *kiṣk*).
