### Translation
1. The two spouse-finders which thy mother rubbed up for thee when born  
(fem.)—for them ⌊*tátra*⌋ let not the ill-named one be greedy, the  
*aliṅśa* nor the *vatsápa* (calf-drinker *or* -protector?).

### Notes
Weber (and Zimmer after him: p. 321) conjectures that the two 'winners  
of a husband ' are the breasts, and that the reference is to the  
ceremonious washing of the young child. The numerous names of evil  
beings in the hymn are in good part unknown elsewhere and  
untranslatable; of some of them tentative versions can be added in  
parenthesis. The comm. reads *alīśas* in **d**, and explains it as *ali*  
+ *īśa* ⌊taking *ali* as diseases (or deities representing them) that  
fly about like bees⌋.

Let neither fiend of evil name, Alinsa, Vatsapa, desire Thy pair of husband-wooers which thy mother cleansed when, thou wast born.
