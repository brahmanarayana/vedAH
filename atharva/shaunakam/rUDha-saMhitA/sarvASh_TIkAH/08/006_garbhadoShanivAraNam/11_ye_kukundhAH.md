### Translation
11. The *kukúndhas*, the *kukū́rabhas*, that bear skins (*kṛ́tti*), pelts  
(? *dūrśá*), dancing on like impotent men, that make a noise in the  
forest—them we make disappear from here.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *kakundhāṣ karūrabhāṣ kṛtyāir duriśāni bibhrati: klīvāi ’va  
pr. ghoṣāṁ ye kurvate vane*. The comm. has *kṛkandhāḥ kukūravāḥ kṛtyāir  
dūṣyāni*.

Kukundhas and Kukurabhas who dress themselves in hides and skins, Who dance about like eunuchs, who raise a wild clamour in the wood, all these we banish far away.
