### Translation
23. They who eat raw meat, and who the flesh of men, the hairy ones  
\[that\] devour embryos—them we make to disappear from here.

### Notes
Ppp. combines at the beginning *yā ”mam*, and has in place of our **d**  
*’rāyān* ⌊combined *keśavārāyan*⌋ *asyā bhaṅsaso muṣkayor apa hanmasi*  
(as in its version of our 5 **c, d**—cf. 2). The *pada*-reading  
*keśa॰vā́ḥ* is quoted in the commentary to Prāt. iv. 18.
