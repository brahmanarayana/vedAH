### Translation
21. Set thou in the reciter, O Agni, that eye with which thou seest the  
hoof-breaking sorcerers; Atharvan-like, with brightness of the gods,  
scorch (*uṣ*) down the truth-damaging fool (*acít*).

### Notes
The obscure epithet in **b** is divided in *pada*-text *śapha॰ārújaḥ*  
(RV. *-jam*, and later *yātudhā́nam*). The comm. is in part obscure:  
*śaphārujaḥ śaphavat śaphāḥ: nakhā ity arthaḥ;* but he adds as  
alternative *atha vā paśurūpadhāriṇāṁ śaphā api* *sambhavanti: tāir  
ārujantī ’ti śaphārujaḥ:* i.e. 'breaking things with their hoofs.' The  
irregularity of meter allows us to suspect the tradition of the word.  
The comm. also strangely explains *rebhe* as *śabdaṁ kurvate rakṣase!*  
⌊Root *ribh:* cf. note to vs. 7.⌋ Ppp. reads in **d** *atiti* for  
*acitam*. The verse is RV. vs. 12, where it is decidedly better in  
place.

Lend thou the worshipper that eye, O Agni, where with thou lookest on the hoof-armed demons. With light celestial in Atharvan's manner burn up the fool who ruins truth with falsehood.
