### Translation
18. From of old, O Agni, thou killest the sorcerers; the demons have not  
conquered thee in fights; burn up the flesh-eaters together with their  
dupes (? *mūrá*); let them not be freed from thy heavenly missile.

### Notes
We had this verse above, as v. 29. 11. The only variant in the version  
of RV. (vs. 19) is that, in **c**, *sahámūrān* is put after *ánu daha;*  
⌊so also SV. i. 80, which has besides *kayā́das* for *kravyā́das*. The  
comm. regards *-mūrān* as for *-mūlān*, and renders it *mūlasahitān*  
'together with their roots,' and it is perhaps one of the cases  
contemplated by Prāt. i. 66—at least, the commentary there quotes this  
passage as one of the instances of substitution of *r* for *l;* and it  
is very likely that the tradition is right.

Agni, from days of old thou slayest demons: never have Rakshasas in fight o'ercome thee. Burn up the foolish ones, the flesh-devourers: let none of them escape thy heavenly arrow.
