### Translation
16. Let the sorcerers bear \[off\] poison of the kine; let them of evil  
courses fall under the wrath of Aditi; let god Savitar abandon them; let  
them lose their share of the herbs.

### Notes
'Lose': lit. 'have it conquered from them.' RV. (vs. 18: RV. inverts the  
order of our vss. 16 and 17) reads *pibantu* for *bharantām* (with Ppp.)  
in **a**, has the proper passive form *vṛścyantām* in **b** (Ppp. has  
*mṛddhyantām*), and leaves *enān* unlingualized in **c**; the  
lingualization in our text is by Prāt. iii. 80, where the commentary  
quotes this passage.

Let the fiends steal the poison of the cattle: may Aditi cast off the evil-doers. May the God Savitar give them up to ruin, and be their share of herbs and plants denied them.
