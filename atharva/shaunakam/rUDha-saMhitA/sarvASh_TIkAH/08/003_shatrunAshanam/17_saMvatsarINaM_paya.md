### Translation
17. Yearly \[is\] the milk of the ruddy \[cow\]; of that let not the  
sorcerer partake (*aś*), O men-watcher; whatever one \[of them\], O  
Agni, would fain enjoy (*tṛp*) the beestings, him do thou pierce back in  
the vitals with thy burning (*arcís*).

### Notes
Our *pada*-text divides wrongly *mā́: āśīt* in **b**; RV. has the true  
reading, *mā́: aśīt*. RV. also has *márman* at the end, making the  
*triṣṭubh* verse regular. Ppp. once more reads *vidhi* (not *viddhi*  
this time) for *vidhya* in **d**, and *marman* after it.

The cow gives milk each year, O Man-Beholder: let not the Yatudhana ever taste it. Agni, if one should glut him with the biestings, pierce with thy flame his vitals as he meets thee.
