### Translation
11. Let the sorcerer thrice come within thy reach (? *prásiti*), who, O  
Agni, slays truth (*ṛtá*) with untruth; roaring \[at\] him with thy  
flame (*arcís*), O Jātavedas, do thou put him down (*ni-yuj*) before the  
eyes of the singer.

### Notes
Our *ní yun̄dhi* at the end is a weakened corruption of RV. *ni vṛn̄dhi*,  
which is read also by Ppp., the comm., and one of SPP's authorities.  
SPP. reads *yun̄gdhi*, not heeding the rule of the Prāt. (ii. 20) to the  
contrary. ⌊Cf. his *bhan̄gdhi* in vs. 6. And in his "Corrections" to vol.  
ii., he is at pains thrice to correct *vṛn̄dhi* of p. 71-2 to *vṛn̄gdhi*.⌋  
The majority of the mss. (including all ours save D.R.p.m.K.) accent  
*ágne* in **b**; both editions, of course, emend to *agne*. The comm.  
paraphrases *prásitim* with *jvālām;* he does not deign to add any  
explanation to *sphūrjáyan*. The occurrence of *enam* in **d** seems to  
require us to regard *tám* as object of *sphūrjáyan*.

Thrice, Agni, let thy noose surround the demon who with his falsehood injures holy Order. Loud roaring with thy flame, Jatavedas, fetter him in the pre- sense of the singer.
