### Translation
24. With great light Agni shineth out; he maketh all things manifest by  
his greatness; he forceth away the ill-conditioned ungodly wiles; he  
sharpeneth his two horns to gore the demons.

### Notes
All the authorities read at the end *viníkṣve*, and even the comm. is  
with them, calling the *v* a Vedic accretion (*vakāropajanaś  
chāndasaḥ*). RV., in the corresponding verse (v. 2. 9: repeated without  
variant in TS. i. 2. 14⁷), has *viníkṣe*, which our edition reads by  
emendation, SPP. retaining the totally inadmissible *v*, which seems to  
have blundered into the word out of *ví nikṣva* in the following verse.  
RV. (and TS.) has before it *rákṣase* (sing.).

Agni shines far and wide with lofty splendour, and by his great- ness makes all things apparent. He conquers godless and malign enchantments, and sharpens both his horns to gore the ogres.
