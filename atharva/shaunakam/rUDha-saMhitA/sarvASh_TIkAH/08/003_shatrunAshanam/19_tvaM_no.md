### Translation
19. Do thou, O Agni, from below, from above, do thou defend us from  
behind and from in front; let those \[flames\] of thine, unaging,  
extremely hot, greatly paining, burn against the evil-plotter.

### Notes
RV. (vs. 20) reads *údaktāt* at end of **a**, and *té* for *tyé* in  
**c**; in the latter case, the comm. does the same; he supplies  
*sphulin̄gas* as the missing noun in **c, d**. An accent-mark has dropped  
out in our edition under the *-du-* of *paścā́d utá* in **b**.

Guard us, O Agni, from above and under, protect us from be- hind and from before us; And may thy flames, most fierce and never wasting, glowing with fervent heat, consume the sinner.
