### Translation
22. Thee the devout, O Agni, powerful one, would we fain put about us  
\[as\] a stronghold, \[thee\] of daring color, day by day, slayer of the  
destructive one.

### Notes
We have had this verse above, as vii. 71. 1; for its different  
correspondences and variants, see the note at that place; ⌊but Ppp. here  
ends with *bhan̄gurāvatām*⌋. The comm., though he notes it as 'explained  
above,' goes on to give a new explanation, curiously accordant with and  
yet not a little different from the other; the most important point of  
difference is that, in explaining *pari dhīmahi*, he there gave us our  
choice between *parito dhārayāmaḥ* and *paridhiṁ kurmaḥ*, while here he  
gives us our choice between the latter and *dhyāyemahi*. The real reason  
of the repetition probably is that he this time reads at the end  
*bhan̄gurāvatām*, with RV. ⌊and Ppp.⌋, while before he had no variant  
from our AV. text. ⌊Here and in vs. 23, W. queries his version of  
*bhan̄g-* as he did at vii. 71, which see.⌋
