### Translation
23. With poison smite thou back the destructive ones, the demoniacs, O  
Agni, with keen brightness (*śocís*), with heat-pointed flames (*arcí*).

### Notes
RV. in **b** lingualizes the particle to *ṣma*, and reads *daha* for  
*jahi;* and it ends **d** with *ṛṣṭíbhis* instead of the anomalous  
*arcíbhis*. Ppp. has in **c** *śukrena* instead of *tigména*.  
  
The RV. hymn ends with four *anuṣṭubh* verses, of which only the first  
two find place thus in our text.

With deadly poison strike thou back the treacherous brood of Rakshasas, O Agni, with thy sharpened glow, with rays that flash with points of flame.
