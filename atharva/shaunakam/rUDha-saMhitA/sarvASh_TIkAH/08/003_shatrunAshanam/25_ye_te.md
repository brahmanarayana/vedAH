### Translation
25. The two horns that thou hast, O Jātavedas, unaging, of keen thrust,  
sharpened by devotion (*bráhman*)—with them do thou gore, O Jātavedas,  
the attacking enemy (*durhā́rd*), the advancing *kimīdín* with thy flame  
(*arcís*).

### Notes
At the end of this verse, nikṣva seems to have been taken for a 2d sing,  
middle; but it is doubtless a corruption\* for *nikṣa*, the root showing  
an *a*-stem elsewhere. Ppp. avoids the error by reading *nṛcakṣaḥ;* and  
also *yātudhānam* for *arciṣā* before it, which gets rid of yet another  
difficulty of construction, though it makes the irregular meter yet  
worse. In our edition, in **d**, the accent-mark which should stand  
under the *do* of *jātavedo* has slipped out of place to the left, under  
*ve*. \*⌊We must assume that the corruption is an old one if the *v* of  
*viníkṣve* is to be ascribed to it. Since the forms from stem *nikṣa-*  
are so few (in 3 AV. verses), perhaps we might after all assume that  
this is a root-class imperative, *nikṣ-ṣva*.⌋

Thy two unwasting horns, O Jatavedas, keen-pointed weapons, sharpened by devotion With these transfix the wicked-souled Kimidin, with fierce flame, Jatavedas! when he meets thee.
