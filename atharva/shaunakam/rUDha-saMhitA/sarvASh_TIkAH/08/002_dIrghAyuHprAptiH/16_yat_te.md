### Translation
16. What enveloping (*paridhā́na*) garment thou hast, what inner wrap  
(*nīví*) thou makest for thyself, that we make propitious unto thy body;  
be it not harsh to thy touch.

### Notes
SPP. reads, "with all his authorities," *ádrūkṣṇam* in **d**. Our mss.  
might doubtless all be understood in the same way, but some of them look  
more like *-ḍū-* or *-dū-;* *-rū-*, which our text unfortunately gives,  
is not found in any; neither *rūkṣṇa* nor *drūkṣṇa* appears to be met  
with elsewhere; the comm. glosses with *arūkṣam;* he also reads *aśnute*  
for *astu te* at the end. Ppp. has *‘dukṣaṇam*. ⌊Vāit. (10. 6) employs  
the vs. in the *paśubandha* on draping the sacrificial post.⌋

Whatever robe to cover thee or zone thou makest for thyself, We make it pleasant to thy frame: may it be soft and smooth to touch.
