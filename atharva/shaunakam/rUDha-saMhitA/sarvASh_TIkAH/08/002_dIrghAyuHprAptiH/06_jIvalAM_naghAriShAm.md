### Translation
6. The lively, by-no-means-harming, living herb, the preserving,  
overpowering, powerful, do I call hither, for this man's freedom from  
harm.

### Notes
⌊Pādas **a** and **b** are repeated at viii. 7. 6.⌋ The accent of the  
two participles *jīvantī́m* and *trāyamāṇā́m* seems to mark them as  
appellatives rather than proper participles. *Naghāriṣá*, like  
*naghamārá*, seems a fusion of the phrase *na ghā* (or *gha*) *riṣyati*  
etc.; the *pada*-mss. chance mostly to agree in the frequent error of  
reading *ṛ* for *ri* (*nagha॰ṛṣā́m;* Bp. *॰riṣā́m*); the comm. reads and  
explains *nagharuṣām*, taking *-gha-* as representing root *han:*  
*yasyāḥ kopo ‘pi na ghātakaḥ;* he regards the plant intended as the  
paths (*Clypea hernandifolia*). Ppp. reads *naghāriṣaṁ*, adds  
*arundhatīm* after *sahasvatīm* in **d**, and has *hvaye* for *huve*.  
The long *ī* in *óṣadhīm* is expressly taught by Prāt. iii. 6;  
*naghāriṣām* is mentioned in the introduction to the fourth chapter  
(add. note 4, at 11. 7).
