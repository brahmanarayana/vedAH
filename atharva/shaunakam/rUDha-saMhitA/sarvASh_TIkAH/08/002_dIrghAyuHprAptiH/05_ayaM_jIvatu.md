### Translation
5. Let this man live; let him not die; him we send together; I make a  
remedy for him; death, do not slay the man.

### Notes
The majority of the mss. (including all ours save Bp.O.) leave *mṛtyo*  
in **d** accentless. ⌊Both editions read *mṛ́tyo*.⌋

Let this man live, let him not die: we raise him, we recover him. I make for him a healing balm. O Death, forbear to slay this man.
