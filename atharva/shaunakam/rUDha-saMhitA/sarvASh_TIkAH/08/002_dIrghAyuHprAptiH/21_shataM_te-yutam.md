### Translation
21. A hundred, a myriad years, two periods (*yugá*), three, four, we  
make for thee; let Indra-and-Agni, let all the gods, approve thee, not  
showing enmity.

### Notes
The second half-verse is i. 35. 4 **c, d**. The 'periods' here are not  
at all likely to be those of the later chronology, though the comm.  
naturally thinks them so. ⌊Alternatively, he makes *yugé* =  
'generations.'⌋ Ppp. has *santu* for *kṛṇmas* in **b**, and omits *te*  
in **c**. The *pada*-mss. read *té: ánu* instead of *te: ánu:* compare  
under i. 35. 4. ⌊We had a "*sataḥpan̄kti*" at vi. 20. 3.⌋
