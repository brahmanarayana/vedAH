8. Bless thou this man, O death; pity him; let him go up from here;  
unharmed, whole-limbed, well-hearing, hundred-yeared by old age, let him  
attain enjoyment with himself.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *him* for *’yam* in **b**, and combines in **d-e** *-hāyanā  
”tm-*. The comm. paraphrases *ātmánā* in **d** with *ananyāpekṣaḥ san*.
