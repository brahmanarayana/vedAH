### Translation
1. Take thou hold. on this bundle (?) of immortality; unsevered length  
of life be thine; I bring back thy life, \[thy\] life-time; go not to  
the welkin (*rájas*), to darkness; do not perish.

### Notes
SPP. with all his authorities save one (which has *snú-*) reads  
*śnúṣṭim* in **a**, and this must doubtless be regarded as the true AV.  
text: compare iii. 17. 2. The comm. glosses it here with *prasnuti* 'a  
dripping forth,' and then explains *amṛtasya śnuṣṭi* as the stream of  
water which, according to one direction in Kāuś. (58. 14), is to be  
poured out while the hymn is recited. He glosses *rajas* with *rāga*,  
and explains it and *tamas* as the two familiar *guṇas* so called: it  
is, indeed, a little startling to find the two names here side by side.

Seize to thyself this trust of life for ever: thine be longevity which nothing shortens. Thy spirit and thy life again I bring thee: die not, nor vanish into mist and darkness.
