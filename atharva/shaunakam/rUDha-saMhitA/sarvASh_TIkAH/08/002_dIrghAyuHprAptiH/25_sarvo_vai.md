### Translation
25. Every one, verily, lives there—ox, horse, man, beast—where this  
charm (*bráhman*) is performed, a defense (*paridhí*) unto living.

### Notes
The verse has a correspondent in TA. (vi. 11. 12), but with a different  
first pāda: TA. makes it *nā vāí tátra prá mīyate* (nearly as our 24  
**c** in Ppp.).

Here verily all creatures live, the cow, the horse, the man, the beast, Here where this holy prayer is used, a rampart that protecteth life. Let it preserve thee from thy peers, from incantation, from thy friends.
