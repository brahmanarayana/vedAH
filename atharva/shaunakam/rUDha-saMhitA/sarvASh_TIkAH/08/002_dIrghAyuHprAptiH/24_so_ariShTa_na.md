### Translation
24. Thou, unharmed one, shalt not die; thou shalt not die, be not  
afraid; \[men\] die not there, nor go to lowest darkness.

### Notes
Ppp. gives in **c** *pra mīyante*—a better reading, as rectifying the  
meter. ⌊Pāda **b** occurs as vs. 1 **a** of a *khila* to RV. i. 191,  
with the two clauses inverted.⌋

Thou, still uninjured, shalt not die: be not afraid; thou shalt not die. Here where I am men do not die or go to lowest depths of gloom.
