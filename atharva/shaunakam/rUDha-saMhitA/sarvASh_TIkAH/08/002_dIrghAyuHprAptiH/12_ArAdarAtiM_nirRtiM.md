### Translation
12. Afar niggardliness, perdition, away seizure (*grā́hi*), the  
flesh-eating *piśācás*, every demon that is of evil nature—that we smite  
away, as it were into darkness.

### Notes
Or 'like darkness.' The comm. reads in **b** *purogrāhim*, and, in  
**d**, *eva* for *iva*. Ppp. has *tavāi ’va* for *tat tama iva*. 'Afar'  
and 'away' in **a, b** anticipate as it were the 'we smite away' of  
**d**.

Far off we drive Malignity, Destruction, Pisachas banqueters on flesh, and Grahi. And all the demon kind, the brood of sin, like darkness, we dispel.
