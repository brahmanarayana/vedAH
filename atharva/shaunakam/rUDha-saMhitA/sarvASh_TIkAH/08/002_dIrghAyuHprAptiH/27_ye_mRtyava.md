### Translation
27. The deaths that are a hundred and one, the perditions (*nāṣṭrā́*)  
that are to be over-passed—from that let the gods free thee, from Agni  
Vāiśvānara.

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **b** *nāṣṭrātta* (*-tu?*) *jīvyāḥ*. ⌊See note to iii. 11.  
5 for "101 deaths."⌋

One and a hundred modes of death, dangers that may be over- come, May Gods deliver thee from this when Agni, dear to all men, bids.
