### Translation
2. Come thou hitherward unto the light of the living; I take thee in  
order to life for a hundred autumns; loosening down the fetters of  
death, imprecation, I set for thee further a longer life-time.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Some of SPP's mss. accent falsely *abhyèhi* in **a**. Ppp. transposes  
the order of **c** and **d**, and reads *lokam* for *arvān̄* in **a**.

Come to the light of living men, come hither: I draw thee to a life of hundred autumns. Loosing the bonds of Death, the curse that holds thee, I give thee age of very long duration.
