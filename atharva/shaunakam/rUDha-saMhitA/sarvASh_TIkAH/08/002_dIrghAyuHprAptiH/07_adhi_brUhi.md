### Translation
7. Bless thou \[him\]; do not take hold; let him loose; even being  
thine, let him be one of completed years (?) here; O Bhava-and-śarva, be  
ye gracious; yield protection; driving away difficulty, bestow ye  
life-time.

### Notes
The obscure *-hāyas* in **b** is translated here as if akin with  
*hāyana* ⌊cf. vs. 8 **d**⌋; the comm. glosses *sarvahāyas* with  
*sarvagati;* the Petersburg Lexicons conjecture 'having complete  
liveliness or power.' For *sā́n*, the comm. reads *sam* ⌊and joins it  
with *sṛjā́*, supplying *prāṇāis*⌋.

Seize him not, but encourage and release him: here let him stay, though thine, in all his vigour. Bhava and Sarva, pity and protect him: give him full life and drive away misfortunes.
