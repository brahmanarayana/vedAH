### Translation
10. Who understandeth (*pra-vid*) the pair-ness of *virā́j?* who the  
seasons, who the ordering (*kálpa*) of her? who her steps (*kráma*), how  
many times milked out (*vi-duh*)? who her abode (*dhā́man*), how many  
times dawnings (*vyùṣṭi*)?

### Notes
The version is much more literal than intelligent, especially at the  
end, where we expect rather *vyùṣṭam* than *-ṭīs*. 'Pair-ness,'  
*mithunatvám*, means especially the condition of being a pair of  
opposite sexes.

Who hath perceived Viraj's duplication, perceived her seasons and her rule and practice? Who knows her steps, how oft, how far extended, who knows her home and number of her dawnings?
