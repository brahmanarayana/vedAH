### Translation
26. One \[is\] the ox, one the sole seer, one the abode, singly the  
blessings; the monster on the earth \[is\] single; the sole season is  
not in excess.

### Notes
Again Ppp. reads *sāma* for *dhāma*, and all the mss. (with Ppp.) have  
*ekaṛṣís* but *ekartús*.  
  
⌊Here ends the ninth *artha-sūkta*. It begins with *kútaḥ*. The quoted  
Anukr. here says *kutaḥ*.⌋

One is the Cow, one is the Single Spirit, one is the law, single are benedictions. The Spirit dwelling on the earth is single: the Single Season never is transcended.
