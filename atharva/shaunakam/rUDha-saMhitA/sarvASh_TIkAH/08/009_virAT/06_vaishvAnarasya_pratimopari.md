### Translation
6. Vāiśvānara's counterpart \[is\] the sky above, as far as Agni forced  
(*bādh*) apart the two firmaments; from that sixth yonder come the  
*sómas*; up from here they go unto the sixth of the day.

### Notes
For *ā́ ’múto*, in **c**, Ppp. reads *āmico*. The remainder of the hymn,  
from this verse on, is by Vāit. 33. 8 allowed to be introduced at  
pleasure in the *navarātra* ceremony.

Vaisvanara's image is the sky above us, so far as Agni forced both spheres asunder. Thence from that region as the sixth come praise-songs, and every sixth day hence again go upward.
