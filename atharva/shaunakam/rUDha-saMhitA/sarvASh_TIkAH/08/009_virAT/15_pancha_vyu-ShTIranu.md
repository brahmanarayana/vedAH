### Translation
15. Five milkings after five dawnings; five seasons after the five-named  
cow; five quarters arranged by the fifteenth—those (f.) \[are\]  
one-headed toward one world.

### Notes
'The fifteenth' (masc. or neut. sing.) might mean also 'fifteen-fold, of  
fifteen parts,' etc. The verse is found in the three other texts (as  
above), but in TS.MS. (also in K.?) separated at some distance from  
those that here precede; also in PGS. iii. 3. 5: all read  
*samānámūrdhnīs* instead of *ékamū-* in **d**.

Five milkings answer to the fivefold dawning, five seasons to the cow who bears five titles. The five sky-regions made fifteen in number, one head have these to one sole world directed.
