### Translation
5. *Bṛhatī́* the measure (*mā́trā*) was fashioned forth out of measure  
\[as\] a mother; illusion (*māyā́*) was born from illusion, Mātalī out of  
illusion.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The desire to play upon the root *mā* 'measure, fashion,' is the leading  
motive in the making of this verse. The *pada*-text gives the absurd  
reading *māyā́ḥ* at beginning of **c**; Ppp. reads after it *hi* instead  
of *ha*.

On measure Brihati is based, and measure on the measurer: From magic might came magic might, from magic might came Matali.
