### Translation
22. Thus thinking what is better have I come hither; in your friendship  
I am auspicious (*śéva*); being of the same birth, your skill is  
propitious; it (m.), understanding, goes about to you all (f.).

### Notes
The adjectives in **a, b** are fem., seeming to indicate that the  
*virāj* is regarded as speaking. Ppp. has *ā ’gaṁ* at end of **a**, and  
*nas* for *vas* both times in *c, d*. 'It' in **d** apparently refers to  
'skill.'

So planning bliss for you have I come hither to win your friendship: kind am I, and gracious. Born from one source, propitious is your wisdom: knowing full well to all of you it cometh.
