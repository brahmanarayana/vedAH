### Comment
Found also (except vss. 19, 20) in Pāipp. xvi. ⌊with vs. 23 after vs. 24⌋. The Kāuś. takes no notice of the hymn; ⌊but the Vāit. (33. 8) allows the use of 21 vss. (from vs. 6 to the end) in the sattra sacrifice at the celebrant's option⌋.


### Translations
Translated: Ludwig, p. 439; Henry, 26, 65; Griffith, i. 416.—See also Muir, v. 370.
