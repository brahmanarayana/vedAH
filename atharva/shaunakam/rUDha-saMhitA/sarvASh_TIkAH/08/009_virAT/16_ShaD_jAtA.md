### Translation
16. Six \[are\] born the beings first-born of righteousness; six  
*sā́mans* carry the six-day (?) \[sacrifice\]; after the six-yoked plough  
(*sī́ra*) severally a *sā́man;* six they call (*ah*) the heavens and  
earths, six the wide \[spaces\].

### Notes
The translation implies in **b** the reading *ṣaḍahám;* this is given in  
our text, against the authority of our *pada*-mss. ⌊which have *ṣáṭ:  
ahám*⌋; the *saṁhitā*-mss. (except O.p.m.) have *ṣaḍ-*. All the latter  
read in **a** *-já rtásya* (p. *prathama॰jā́: ṛtásya* ⌊cf. JAGS. x. 451⌋.

Six Elements arose, first-born of Order: the six-day time is carried by six Samans. Six-yoked the plough is, as each trace is numbered: they call both broad ones six; six, Earth and Heaven.
