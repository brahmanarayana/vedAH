### Translation
20. How did gāyatrī permeate (*vi-āp*) the triple \[*stóma*\]? how is  
*triṣṭúbh* adapted to that of fifteen? how *jāgatī* to that of  
thirty-three? how \[is\] *anuṣṭúbh* that of twenty-one?

### Notes
This verse, like the preceding, is wanting in Ppp.; and they are in a  
manner interruptions of the progress of the hymn.

How hath the Gayatri filled out three triads? On the fifteen how is the Trishtup moulded, Jagati fashioned on the three-and-thirty? How is Anushtup formed? how Ekavinsa?
