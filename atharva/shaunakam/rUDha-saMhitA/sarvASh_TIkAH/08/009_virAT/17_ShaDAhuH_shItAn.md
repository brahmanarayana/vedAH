### Translation
17. Six they call the cold, and six the hot months; tell ye us the  
season, which one \[is\] in excess (*átirikta*); seven eagles  
(*suparṇá*), poets, sat down; seven meters after seven consecrations.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
None of the mss. read *śītā́nṭ ṣáḍ* in **a**, as demanded by Prāt. ii. 9.  
In **d** the construction of the two nouns is reversible.

They call the cold months six, and six the hot ones. Which, tell us, of the seasons is redundant? Seven sages, eagles, have sat down together: seven metres match the seven Consecrations.
