### Translation
3. What three great ones (*bṛhát*, n.) there are, the fourth of which  
\[one\] disjoins \[as\] speech—the priest (*brahmán*) may know it by  
penance, the inspired one, in which one (*ékam*) is joined, in which one  
\[is joined\].

### Notes
Ppp. reads *catvāri* instead of *trīṇi* in **a**. *Caturthám* 'fourth'  
might also be subject of 'disjoins.' Compare ix. 10. 27 (RV. i. 164.  
45).

Which are the three, the mighty three, whereof the fourth divides the voice, This may the Brahman know by prayer and fervour, whereto belongs the one, whereto the other.
