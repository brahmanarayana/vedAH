### Translation
11. This same is she that first shone forth; among these other ones (f.)  
she goes about having entered; great mightinesses \[are\] within her;  
the woman, the new-going generatrix, hath conquered.

### Notes
This verse occurred above, as iii. 10. 4. It is found also in other  
texts in connection with the four verses which follow it here. Ppp. has  
⌊in **a, b**⌋ the same readings as in iii. 10. ⌊4 **a, b**⌋; ⌊and, here  
also, it inverts the order of **c** and **d**⌋.

She here who first of all sent forth her lustre moves onward resting on these lower creatures. Exalted power and might are stored within her: the woman hath prevailed, the new-come mother.
