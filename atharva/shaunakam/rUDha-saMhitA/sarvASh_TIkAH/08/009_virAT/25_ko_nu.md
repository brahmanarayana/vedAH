### Translation
25. What now \[is\] the ox (*gó*), who the sole seer, what the abode  
(*dhā́man*), what the blessings (*āśís*)? the monster on the earth \[is\]  
simple (*ekavṛ́t*); the sole season—which now is that?

### Notes
Ppp. reads *sāma* for *dhāma* in **b**. All our mss. combine *ekaṛṣís*  
in **a**, but all *ekartús* (also Ppp.) in **d**. It is necessary here  
and in the next verse to render *gāús* 'ox,' because the accompanying  
adjectives are masculine. 'Which' in **d** is the superlative *katamá*.  
⌊Over "simple" W. has interlined "single."⌋
