### Translation
23. Eight of Indra, six of Yama, seven of the seers, seven-fold; waters,  
men (*manuṣyà*), herbs—them five followed (*sac*) after.

### Notes
The nouns in **c** are accusatives, and are apparently summed up in  
'them' (*tā́n*). All the mss. this time read with our text *yamásya ṛ́ṣ-*  
in **a-b**. Ppp. puts the verse after our 24.
