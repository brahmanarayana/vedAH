### Translation
24. Since the heifer milked solely (*kévalī*) for Indra \[his\] will  
(*váśa*), the beestings, \[when\] first milked, then \[she\] gratified  
in four ways the four—gods, men, Asuras, and seers.

### Notes
Ppp. reads at the end *atha rṣīn;* all our mss. save O. make the  
combination *utá ṛ́ṣin* as in the printed text.
