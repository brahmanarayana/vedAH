### Translation
18. Seven \[are\] the offerings (*hóma*), the fuels seven, the sweet  
things (*mádhu*, n.) seven, the seasons seven; seven sacrificial butters  
(*ā́jya*) went about the existent thing (*bhūtá*); those (f .) are  
seven-vultured, so have we heard.

### Notes
The version is as literal as possible; to modify it would imply an  
understanding of it. The nearest fem. word for 'those' in **d** to  
relate to is 'fuels' in **a**. All the *saṁhitā*-mss. combine *saptá  
rtávo* in **b**. Ppp. reads in **b** *nu* for *ha*, and has instead of  
our **c, d**: *sapta jyāyāṁ parihūta gāyaṁ saptahotā ṛtudayajetitās  
sapta gṛdhrā iti śuśravā ’haṁ.* Nearly all the mss. (all of ours save  
E.) read *āyam* (the *saṁhitā*-mss. *-aṁ*) at end of **c**.

Seven are the Homas, seven the logs for burning, seven are the streams of mead, and seven the seasons. Into the world have come seven streams of butter; those we have heard of as the Seven Vultures.
