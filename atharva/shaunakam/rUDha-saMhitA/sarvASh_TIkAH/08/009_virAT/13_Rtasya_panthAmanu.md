### Translation
13. Three (f.) have come along the road of righteousness; three heats  
(*gharmá*) have come after the seed; one (f.) enlivens the progeny, one  
the refreshment (*ū́rj*); one defends the realm of the godly ones.

### Notes
The verse follows the preceding in the other three texts also. TS.MS.  
rectify the meter of **b** by reading *gharmā́sas*, and for *rétas* MS.  
has *rétasā* and TS. *jyótiṣā;* TS. gives rákṣati for *jínvati* in  
**c**; and for *rāṣṭrám* in **d** TS. has *vratám* and MS. *kṣatrám*.
