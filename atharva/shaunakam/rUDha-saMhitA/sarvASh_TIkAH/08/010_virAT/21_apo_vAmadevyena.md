### Translation
21. She ascended; she came to men (*manuṣyà*); men slew her; she at once  
(*sadyás*) came into being; therefore on both days they present  
(*upa-hṛ*) to men; in his house do they present who knoweth thus.

### Notes
'Present,' i.e. 'food'; 'on both days' is a queer expression for 'every  
day.' Ppp. is corrupt, but perhaps means *ahar-ahar manuṣyāṇām upa h-.*
