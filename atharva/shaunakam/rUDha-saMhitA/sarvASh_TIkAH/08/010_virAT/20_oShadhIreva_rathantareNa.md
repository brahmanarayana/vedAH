### Translation
20. She ascended; she came to the gods; the gods slew her; she in a  
half-month came into being; therefore for the gods they make *váṣaṭ* in  
a half-month: he understandeth the road that goes to the gods who  
knoweth thus.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *tasmād ardhamāse devebhyo juhoti: juhoty agnihotraṁ pra  
devay-*. O.K. again accent *jānā́ti*.

She rose, she came unto the Gods: they killed her: but in a fortnight she again was living. Fortnightly, hence, men serve the Gods with Vasat! Who knows this knows the way which Gods pass over.
