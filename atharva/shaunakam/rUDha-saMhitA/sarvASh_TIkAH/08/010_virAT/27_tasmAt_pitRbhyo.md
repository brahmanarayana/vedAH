### Translation
27. She ascended; she came to the Gandharvas and Apsarases; the  
Gandharvas and Apsarases called to her: O thou of sweet (*púṇya*) odor,  
come! of her Chitraratha son of Sūryavarchas was young, the blue-lotus  
leaf \[was\] vessel; her Vasuruchi son of Sūryavarchas milked; from her  
he milked sweet odor; upon that sweet odor the Gandharvas and Apsarases  
subsist; of sweet odor, one to be subsisted upon, becometh he who  
knoweth thus.

She rose approached the Apsarases and Gandharvas. They called her, Come to us, O Fragrant-scented! The son of Suryavarchas, Chitraratha, was her dear calf, her pail. a lotus-petal. The son of Suryavarchas, Vasuruchi, milked and drew from her most delightful fragrance. That scent supports Apsarases and Gandharvas. He who knows this becomes a meet supporter, and round him ever breathes delicious odour.
