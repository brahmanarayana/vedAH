### Translation
7. She ascended; she descended in address (? *āmántraṇa*); \[men\] go to  
his address, fit for address becometh he who knoweth thus.

### Notes
By the connection, āmántraṇa ought to involve the idea of a locality.  
Instead of ⌊line 2?⌋, Ppp. repeats *yajñānto vāsateyo bhavati* etc. from  
§4.
