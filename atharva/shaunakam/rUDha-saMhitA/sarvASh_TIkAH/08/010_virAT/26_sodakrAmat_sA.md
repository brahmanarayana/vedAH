### Translation
26. She ascended; she came to the gods; the gods called to her: O  
refreshment, come! of her Indra was young, the bowl \[was\] vessel; her  
god Savitar milked; from her he milked refreshment; upon that  
refreshment the gods subsist; one to be subsisted upon becometh he who  
knoweth thus.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *dārupātram* instead of *camasas* in **b**, and omits *devas*  
in **c**.

She rose, she came unto the Gods. They called her, crying, O Vigour, come to us, come hither! God Savitar milked her, he milked forth Vigour. The Gods depend for life upon that Vigour. He who knows this becomes a meet supporter.
