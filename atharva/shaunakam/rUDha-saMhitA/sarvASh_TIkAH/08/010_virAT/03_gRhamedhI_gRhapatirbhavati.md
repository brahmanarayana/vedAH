### Translation
3. She ascended; she descended in the fire of offering (*āhavanī́ya*): to  
his god-invocation the gods go, dear to the gods becometh he who knoweth  
thus.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The introductory clause *só ’d akrāmat*, which belongs to the paragraphs  
from here on to 29 inclusive (8-17 counting in this respect as a single  
paragraph), is omitted by the mss., according to their custom, almost  
without exception, until the last paragraph, 29, where all give it; it  
is restored throughout in our edition. R. alone gives it in this  
paragraph.

She mounted up, the Eastward fire she entered. He who knows this becomes the Gods' beloved, and to his call they come when she invokes them.
