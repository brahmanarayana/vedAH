### Translation
23. She ascended; she came to the Fathers; the Fathers called to her: O  
*svadhā́*, come! of her king Yama was young, the silver-vessel \[was\]  
vessel; her Antaka son of Mṛityu milked; from her he milked *svadhā́;*  
that *svadhā́* the Fathers subsist upon: one to be subsisted upon  
becometh he who knoweth thus.

### Notes
The *saṁhitā*-mss. vary a good deal over *mārtyavò ‘dhok:* P.M. read  
*mārtvyò*, R. *mārtvyó*, E.O.K. *mārtyavó*, T. *mārtyávo;* ⌊cf.  
introd.⌋. Ppp. has instead *ādityo;* and it omits *rājā* after *yamas;*  
it puts the paragraph after our 24.
