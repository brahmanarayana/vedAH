### Translation
4. She ascended; she descended in the southern ⌊*dákṣiṇa*⌋ fire:  
justified (? *-ṛtá*) by the offering, fit for sacrificial gifts  
⌊*dakṣiṇī́ya*⌋, fit for refuge (*vā́sateya*) becometh he who knoweth thus.

### Notes
Our *pada*-mss. divide *yajñártas* into *yajña॰ṛ́taḥ*, which is evidently  
wrong, for *yajñá॰ṛtaḥ* ⌊as indeed two of SPP's read⌋; and the quotation  
of the word under Prāt. iii. 64 also indicates that the latter is the  
true accent. Ppp. reads instead *yajñāntas*, and omits after it  
*dakṣiṇīyas*.

She mounted up, the Southward fire she entered. He who knows this becomes a fit performer of sacrifice, meet for honour, shelter-giver.
