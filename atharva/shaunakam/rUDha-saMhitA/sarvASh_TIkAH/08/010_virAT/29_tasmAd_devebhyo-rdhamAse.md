### Translation
29. She ascended; she came to the serpents; the serpents called to her:  
O poisonous one, come! of her Takshaka descendant of Viśāla was young,  
the gourd-vessel \[was\] vessel; her Dhṛitarāshṭra son of Irāvant  
milked; from her he milked poison; upon that poison the serpents  
subsist; one to be subsisted upon becometh he who knoweth thus.

### Notes
All the mss. give the first phrase in this verse, where it is for the  
last time repeated. *Āirā॰vatáḥ* is quoted under Prāt. iv. 55 as an  
example of a word divided in the *pada*-text notwithstanding its  
secondary formation with initial *vṛddhi*. Ppp. reads *viṣābhayas* for  
*vāiśāleyas* in **b**, and combines *-rāṣṭrāi ”rāv-* in **c** ⌊R's  
collation has *-răṣṭrāirāv-*⌋.  
  
    
  
\[**Paryāya VI.**—*catuṣkas. 30. 2-p. virāḍ gāyatrī; 31. 2-p. sāmnī  
triṣṭubh; 32. 2-p. prājāpatyā ’nuṣṭubh; 33. 2-p. ārcy uṣṇih.*\]

She mounted up, she came unto the Serpents. The Serpents called her, Venomous! come hither. Her calf was Takshaka, Visala's offspring: a bottlegourd suppli- ed a milking-vessel. Iravan's offspring, Dhritarashtra milked her, and from her udder drew forth only poison. That poison quickens and supports the Serpents: He who knows this becomes a meet supporter.
