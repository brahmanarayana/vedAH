### Translation
22. She ascended; she came to the Asuras; the Asuras called to her: O  
illusion (*māyā́*), come! of her Virochana son of Prahrāda was young  
(*vatsá*), the metal-(*áyas-*)vessel \[was\] vessel; her Dvimūrdhan son  
of Ṛitu milked; from her he milked illusion; that illusion the Asuras  
subsist upon; one to be subsisted on becometh he who knoweth thus.

### Notes
R. alone gives the first phrase in §§22-28. In this and the following  
paragraphs to 29 inclusive, the text should accent *ā́sīt*, with all the  
mss. Ppp. reads *vāirocanas* instead of *vir-*. Single points in these  
paragraphs find correspondences in MS. iv. (p. 21, l. 14 ff.; p. 36, l.  
8 ff.) and in TB. ii. 2. 9⁶ ff. ⌊cf. i. 5. 9²⌋.

She rose, approached the Asuras: they called her: their cry was, Come, O Maya, come thou hither. Her dear calf was Virochana Prahradi: her milking vessel was a. pan of iron. Dvimurdha Artvya milked her, yea, this Maya, The Asuras depend for life on Maya. He who knows this becomes a fit supporter.
