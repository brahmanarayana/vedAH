### Translation
1. Both one of me and ten of me \[are\] the exorcisers (*apavaktár*), O  
herb; thou born of right (*ṛtá*), thou rich in right, mayest thou,  
honeyed (*madhulā́*), make honey for me.

### Notes
Ppp. omits throughout the second *me* in **a**, and reads for **d**  
*madhu tvā madhulā karat*. The Anukr. says *madhulām oṣadhīm astāut*.
