### Translation
10. In thy way (? *tmányā*) anointing them, pour thou down upon  
(*upa-ava-sṛj*) the track of the gods the oblations in due season; let  
the forest-tree, the queller (*śamitár*), god Agni, relish (*svad*) the  
oblation with honey, with ghee.

### Notes
'Forest-tree,' doubtless a big name for the sacrificial post. That the  
'queller' is a separate personage is shown by the plural number of the  
following verb. ⌊E. Sieg discusses *pā́thas*, Gurupūjakaumudī, 97 ff.;  
later, Oldenberg, ZDMG. liv. 602.⌋

Bring thou to our oblations which thou balmest the companies of Gods in ordered season. Agni, Vanaspati, the Immolator sweeten our offered gifts with meath and butter!
