### Translation
3. Making oblation do thou, O Agni, to be praised and to be greeted,  
come in accord with the Vasus. Thou art invoker (*hótṛ*) of the gods, O  
youthful one (? *yahvá*); do thou, sent forth, skilled sacrificer  
(*yájīyaṅs*), sacrifice to them.

### Notes
*Ajúhvāna* in **a** is perhaps to be understood as passive (= *ā́huta*),  
'receiving oblation.' There are no variants. The Anukr. absurdly calls  
this verse a *pan̄kti*, because, by omitting resolutions of semivowels  
etc., it is capable of being read as 40 syllables. The Anukr's of RV.  
and VS. both reckon it as *triṣṭubh*.
