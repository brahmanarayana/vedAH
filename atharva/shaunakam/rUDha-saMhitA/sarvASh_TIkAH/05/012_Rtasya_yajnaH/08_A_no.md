### Translation
8. Unto our sacrifice let Bhāratī come quickly, let Iḍā, taking note  
here in human fashion; let the three goddesses, well-working, sit upon  
this pleasant *barhís*—\[also\] Sarasvatī.

### Notes
The translation implies in **d** the reading *sárasvatī*, given by  
RV.VS.MS.; TB. ⌊both ed's, Bibl. Ind. and Poona⌋ supports AV. in reading  
*-tīḥ*, which, however, can hardly be anything but a blunder. The four  
other texts have at the end *sadantu*. All our mss. have *manuṣyát* in  
**b** ⌊and so have all SPP's authorities⌋, and this form is  
authenticated by Prāt. iv. 65, the comment explaining how it is derived  
from *manuṣyavat*. As being, therefore, the indubitable AV. reading, it  
should not have been altered in our edition to *-ṣvát*, to conform with  
the four other texts, even though doubtless a corruption of *-ṣvát*.  
⌊SPP. also alters it.⌋ ⌊In **c**, correct *davī́r* to *devī́r*.⌋

Let Bharati come quickly to our worship and Ila showing like a human being. So let Sarasvati and both her fellows, deft Goddesses, on this fair grass be seated.
