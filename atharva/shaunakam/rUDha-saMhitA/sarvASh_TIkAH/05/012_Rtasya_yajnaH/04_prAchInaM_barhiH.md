### Translation
4. The forward *barhís*, through the fore-region of the earth, is  
wreathed on this dawn (*vástu*), at the beginning (*ágra*) of the days;  
it spreads out abroad more widely, pleasant to the gods, to Aditi.

### Notes
'Forward' and 'fore-region,' i.e. 'eastward' and 'east.' All our mss.  
read *vṛjyase* in **b**, but the edition makes the necessary emendation  
to *-te*, in accordance with the four other texts, and the translation  
given implies *-te*.
