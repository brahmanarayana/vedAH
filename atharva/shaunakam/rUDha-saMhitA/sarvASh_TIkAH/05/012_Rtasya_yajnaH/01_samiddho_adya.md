### Translation
1. Kindled this day in the home of man (*mánus*), thou, a god, O  
Jātavedas, dost sacrifice to the gods; and do thou bring \[them\],  
understanding it, O thou of friendly might; thou art a forethoughtful  
messenger, poet.

### Notes
The only variant in this verse is that MS. omits the peculiar and  
problematic accent of *váha* in **c**.

Thou in the house of man this day enkindled worshippest Gods as God, O Jatavedas. Observant, bright as Mitra, bring them hither. Thou art a sapient and foreknowing envoy.
