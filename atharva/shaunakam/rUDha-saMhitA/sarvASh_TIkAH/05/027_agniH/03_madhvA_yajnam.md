### Translation
3. With honey he attains the sacrifice, pleased, the praised of men  
(*nárāśáṅsa*), Agni the well-doing, the heavenly impeller (*savitár*),  
having all choice things.

### Notes
All the other texts, including Ppp., read in **a** *prīṇānás*, of which  
our *prāiṇ-* is doubtless to be regarded as a blundering corruption.  
VS.TS. have before it *nakṣase;* and, in **b**, *agne*, with  
interpunction after it; Ppp. omits *agne* (or *agniḥ*); MS. adds as  
third pāda the first pāda of our and the other texts' vs. 4. Our  
pāda-text rightly divides the verse into three pādas ⌊10: 8: 9⌋, though  
the Anukr. acknowledges only two.
