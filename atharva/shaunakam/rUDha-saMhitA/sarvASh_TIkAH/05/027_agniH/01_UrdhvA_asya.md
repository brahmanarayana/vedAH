### Translation
1. Uplifted becomes his fuel, uplifted the bright burnings of Agni, most  
brilliant; of beautiful aspect, with his son,—\[2.\] son of himself  
(*tánūnápāt*), *ásura*, many-handed,—

### Notes
All the Yajur-Veda texts agree in ending the verse with the third pāda,  
and in reading at the end *suprátikasya sūnóḥ;* of this our text is a  
palpable corruption, and apparently made after the addition to this  
verse of the following pāda, in order to help their connection. Ppp.  
also has *-kasya sūnos*, and at the end of **a** *bhavantu;* it and the  
the Yajus-texts read *viśvávedās* instead of *bhū́ripāṇis*. The  
description of the verse by the Anukr. ⌊if we pronounce *ūrdhuā́* in  
**a**⌋ is correct, counting the second pāda as of 9 syllables.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
    
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
2 \[2 **b**\]. A god among gods, the god anoints the roads with honey  
(*mádhu*), with ghee.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
The end of this verse is the proper end of vs. 2; MS., however, adds to  
it the first pāda of our 3; and it reads for **a** *devó devébhyo  
devayā́nān*. In **b**, VS. MS. have *anaktu;* TS., *ā́ ’nakti;* and VS.TS.  
set the *avāsana*-mark next before *pathás*.

Uplifted be this sacrificer's fuel: lofty and brilliant be the flames of Agni! Splendidly bright, fair-faced, with all his offspring, Tanunapat the Asura, many-handed.
