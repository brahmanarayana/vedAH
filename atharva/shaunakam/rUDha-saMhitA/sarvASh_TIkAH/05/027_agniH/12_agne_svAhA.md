### Translation
12. O Agni, hail! make thou, O Jātavedas, the sacrifice for Indra; let  
all the gods enjoy this oblation.

### Notes
The Yajus-texts put the pause in its proper place before *víśve*. For  
*yajñám*, TS.VS. read *havyám*, and MS. has *devébhyas;* Ppp. has  
*bhāgam*. This "*purauṣṇih*" counts (if we divide the last two pādas as  
indicated in the *pada*-text) 11: 9 + 7 = 27 syllables.

Vanaspati, rejoicing, of thyself send God-ward! Let Agni, Im- molator, sweeten our libation.
