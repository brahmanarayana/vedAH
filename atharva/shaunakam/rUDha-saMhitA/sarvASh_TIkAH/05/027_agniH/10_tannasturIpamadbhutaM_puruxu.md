### Translation
10. That wonderful seminal fluid (*turī́pam*) of ours, abounding in food,  
O god Tvashṭar, abundance of wealth, release thou the navel of it.

### Notes
The other texts (including Ppp.) omit *deva* and read *tváṣṭā* (but MS.  
*tváṣṭar*), adding after it *suvī́ryam\*;* all also have at the end  
*asmé* instead of the senseless *asyá*, and all but MS. have *ṣyatu* for  
*ṣya;* their mark of interpunction is set after *suvī́ryam* (or before  
*rāyás*). Compare also RV. ii. 40. 4; iii. 4. 9. Our Bp.² reads in  
**a**, by an oversight, *ádbhum* (emended in Bp. to *ádbhutam*); but  
D.K. have *át॰bhutam* as *pada*-text. This and the two following verses  
have small right to be called *purauṣṇiḥ;* this one counts 11: 8 + 7 =  
26 syllables. Read at the end in our text *asyá* (an accent-sign slipped  
out of place). \*⌊But TS. *suviram.*⌋
