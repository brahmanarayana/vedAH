### Translation
11. O forest-tree, let thou loose, bestowing; let Agni \[as\] queller  
willingly sweeten the oblation for the gods.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *sumanā* for *tmanā;* also, at the end, *sūdayāti*, with the  
Yajus-texts. The latter also have (except MS.) *devéṣu* for *devébhyas*,  
and after it they all put their mark of interpunction. The Yajus and  
Ppp. version of the last pāda is identical with RV. iii. 4. 10 **b**  
⌊save that RV. has *havís*⌋. This "*purauṣṇih*" counts 11: 9 + 7 = 27  
syllables.
