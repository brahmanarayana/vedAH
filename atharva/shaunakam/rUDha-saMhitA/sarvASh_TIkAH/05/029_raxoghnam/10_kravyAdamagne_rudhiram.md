### Translation
10. The flesh-eating, bloody (*rudhirá*), mind-slaying *piśācá* do thou  
slay, O Agni, Jātavedas; let the vigorous Indra slay him with the  
thunderbolt; let bold Soma cut \[off\] his head.

### Notes
The Anukr. takes no notice of the lacking syllables in **b** and **c**,  
the latter of which, indeed, is easily made up for by resolving  
*vá-jṛ-e-ṇa*.
