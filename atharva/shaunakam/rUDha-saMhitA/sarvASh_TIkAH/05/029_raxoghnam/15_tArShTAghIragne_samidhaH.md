### Translation
15. The pieces of fuel of *tārṣṭāghá*, O Agni, do thou accept with flame  
(*arcís*); let the flesh-eater who wants to take this man's flesh  
(*māṅsá*) quit his form.

### Notes
Or 'of *tṛṣṭāgha*' (**a**); this name, however, seems not to be met with  
anywhere; the *pada*-text reads *tārṣṭa॰aghī́h*.
