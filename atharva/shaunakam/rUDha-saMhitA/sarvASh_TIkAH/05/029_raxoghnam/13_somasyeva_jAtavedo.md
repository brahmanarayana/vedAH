### Translation
13. Like a stalk of soma, O Jātavedas, let this man fill up; make him, O  
Agni, exuberant, sacrificial (*médhya*), free from *yákṣma;* let him  
live.

### Notes
Ppp. is illegible in the last half of the preceding verse and the first  
of this; it reads at the end *jīvase*. Our mss. are uncertain about  
*virapśínam*, B.E.H. having *-psí-*, I. *-ptrā́-*, O. *-śpí*.
