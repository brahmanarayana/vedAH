### Translation
1. Joined in front, carry thou, O Jātavedas; know this, O Agni, as \[it  
is\] being done; thou art a physician (*bhiṣáj*), a maker of remedy  
(*bheṣajá*); by thee may we gain cow, horse, man (*púruṣa*).

### Notes
That is (**b**), take notice of this rite performed in thine honor. The  
verse is found also in HGS. i. 2. 18, which in **a** puts (as does Ppp.)  
*purastāt* at the end, inserts in **b** *karma* after *viddhi*, and  
reads in **d** *gā aśvān puruṣān*. Kāuś. (3. 16) quotes the verse, in  
company with several others, at a certain libation in the *parvan*  
ceremonies.
