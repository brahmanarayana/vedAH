### Translation
14. These, O Agni, are thy *piśācá*-grinding pieces of fuel; them do  
thou enjoy, and accept them, O Jātavedas.

### Notes
The irregular and defective meter of this verse is very inaccurately  
described by the Anukr.; it counts as 8 + 6: 5 + 11 syllables, having  
thus a *kakubh*-element (**b**), but no *bṛhatī*.

Here, Agni, is the fuel, here are logs that crush Pisachas down. O Jatavedas, willingly accept them and be pleased therewith.
