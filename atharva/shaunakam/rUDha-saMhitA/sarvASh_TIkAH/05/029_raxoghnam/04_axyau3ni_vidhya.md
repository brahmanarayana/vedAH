### Translation
4. Pierce thou into his eyes, pierce into his heart, bore into his  
tongue, destroy (*pra-mṛ*) his teeth; whatsoever *piśācá* hath devoured  
of him, that one, O Agni, youngest \[god\], do thou crush back.

### Notes
Ppp. reads for **a** *mokṣāu na viddhi hṛdayaṁ na viddhi* and *piśāco  
syatamo* in **c**, and *yaviṣṭhaṣ* in **d**. Kāuś. (25. 24) quotes the  
verse in a remedial ceremony.

Pierce both his eyes, pierce thou the heart within him, crush thou his teeth and cleave his tongue asunder. Rend thou, most youthful Agni, that Pisacha whoso amid them all of this hath eaten.
