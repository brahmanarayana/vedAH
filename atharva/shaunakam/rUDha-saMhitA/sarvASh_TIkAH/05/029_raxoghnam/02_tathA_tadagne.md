### Translation
2. So, O Agni, Jātavedas, do thou do this, in concord with all the gods:  
he who hath played \[against\] us, whosoever hath devoured (*ghas*) us,  
that this enclosure of his may fall.

### Notes
The sense of **c** appears to be 'whoever hath pillaged us in or by  
play.' The sense of the imprecation in **d** is obscure. Ppp. reads as  
follows: *tvam* for *tat* in **a**; for **b, c** *’nena vidvān haviṣā  
yaviṣṭhaḥ: piśāco ‘syatamo\* dideva; ‘sya* in **d**; and, as **e** (or  
as 3 **a**), *yo ‘sya tad eva yatamo jaghāsi*. Kāuś. 47. 9 quotes the  
verse (the scholiast says, vss. 2, 3) as accompanying the offering of  
portions of sacrificial butter in witchcraft ceremonies. The Prāt., in  
ii. 77, prescribes the combination *-dhíṣ pát-* in **d**. \*⌊Haplography  
for *‘sya yatamo:* cf. 4 **c**.⌋
