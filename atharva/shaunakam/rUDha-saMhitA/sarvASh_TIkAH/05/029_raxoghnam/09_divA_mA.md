### Translation
9. By day, by night, whatever flesh-eater hath injured me lying in the  
lair of the familiar demons—that let the *piśācás* etc. etc.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *tvā* for *mā* in **a**, and in **b** *ṣkravyād yātuś śayate  
piśācaḥ: ud agne dvān pṛthak: śṛṇīhy apy enaṁ dehi nirṛter upasthe*. In  
**c** of the refrain of all these verses is a syllable lacking, unless  
we make a harsh and unusual resolution.
