### Translation
11. From of old, O Agni, thou killest the sorcerers; the demons have not  
conquered thee in fights; burn up the flesh-eaters together with their  
dupes (?); let them not be freed from thy heavenly missile.

### Notes
This verse is repeated below as viii. 3. 18, in the midst of the RV.  
hymn of which it forms a part: see the note upon it there.

Thou, Agni, ever slayest Yatudhanas, the fiends have never con- quered thee in battles. Consume thou from the root the flesh-devourers, let none of them escape thy heavenly weapon
