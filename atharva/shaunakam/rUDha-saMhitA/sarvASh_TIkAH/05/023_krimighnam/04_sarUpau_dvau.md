### Translation
4. Of like form two, of various form two, black two, red two; both the  
brown and the brown-eared, the vulture and the cuckoo (*kóka*)—they are  
slain.

### Notes
In **d**, the mss. are divided between *te* (B.I.H.s.m.T.?K.) and *té*  
(P.M.W.H.p.m.O.R.), and either reading is acceptable enough. Our text  
gives *te;* the translation above implies *té*. Ppp. makes *sarūpāu* and  
*virūpāu* exchange places, and has in **d** *kokās*.

Worms that are white about the sides, those that are black with black-hued arms, All that show various tints and hues, these worms we utterly destroy.
