### Translation
3. What one creeps about his eyes, what one creeps about his nostrils,  
what one goes to the midst of his teeth—that worm do we grind up.

### Notes
Read in **c, d** in our text *gáchati táṁ* (an accent-sign slipped out  
of place). Ppp. has in **a, b** *‘kṣāu* and *nāsāu* ⌊and in **c**  
apparently *gachasi*⌋.
