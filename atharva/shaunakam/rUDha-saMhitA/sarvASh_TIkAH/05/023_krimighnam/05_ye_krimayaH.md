### Translation
5. The worms that are white-sided, that are black with white arms, and  
whatever ones are of all forms—those worms we grind up.

### Notes
The Anukr. does not notice the deficient syllable of **c**. Ppp. reads  
in **a** *sitavakṣās*, and in **b** *sitabāhavas*.

Eastward the Sun is mounting, seen of all, destroying thing unseen, Crushing and killing all the worms invisible and visible.
