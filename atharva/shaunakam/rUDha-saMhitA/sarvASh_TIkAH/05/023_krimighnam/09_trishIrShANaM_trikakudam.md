### Translation
9. The three-headed, the three-humped (*-kakúd*), the variegated, the  
whitish worm—I crush the ribs of it; I hew at what is its head.

### Notes
The last three pādas are identical with ii. 32. 2 **b-d**, above. Some  
of the mss. (P.M.W.H.p.m.) read in **a** *trāikak-*. Ppp. has for **a,  
b** *yo dviśīrṣaś caturakṣaṣ krimiś carn̄go arjunaḥ* (cf. the Ppp.  
version of ii. 32. 2), and in **d** *apa* for *api*. The deficiency of a  
syllable (unless we read *asia*) in **c** is noticed by the Anukr.  
neither there nor here. The three following verses are the same with ii.  
32. 3-5.

I kill you, worms, as Atri, as Kanva and Jamadagni killed. I crush the worms to pieces with a spell that erst Agastya used.
