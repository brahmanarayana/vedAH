### Translation
8. Slain is the *yévāsha* of the worms, slain also the *nadanimán;* I  
have put them all down, smash (? *maṣmaṣā́*) like *khálva*-grains with a  
millstone.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
*Nadanimán* might possibly mean something like 'a buzzing,' coming from  
a *nadana*, root *nad*. The last pāda is identical with ii. 31. 1 **d**.  
Ppp- has instead: *hato yavākho hataś ca pavir hato ṣaṁ gaṇavāṅ uta:  
hatā viśvā ’rātaya anena vacasā mama* (cf. 2 **c, d**).
