### Translation
7. Praise thou fully, O summit, the many-tracked, skilful (? *ṛ́bhvan*),  
most active (*iná*) Āptya of the Āptyas; may he look on with might, he  
of much force; may he overpower the counterpart of the earth.

### Notes
The RV. version is different throughout: *stuṣéyyam puruvárpasam ṛ́bhvam  
inátamam āptyám āptyā́nām: ā́ darṣate śávasā saptá dā́nūn prá sākṣate  
pratimā́nāni bhū́ri;* and with this Ppp. agrees. The translation follows  
our text servilely, as it may be called, save in the obviously  
unavoidable emendation of *āptám* to *āptyám* in **b**; O. is our only  
ms. that reads *āptyám*. The verse is far too irregular to be let pass  
as merely a *triṣṭubh*.
