### Translation
2. Increasing with might (*śávas*), he of much force, a foe, assigns  
(*dhā*) fear to the barbarian, winning (n.) both what breathes not out  
and what breathes out; brought forward (n.), they resound together for  
thee in the revelings.

### Notes
Sense and connection are extremely obscure; but all the texts (SV. ii.  
834; AA. as above) agree throughout. *Prábhṛtā*, of course, might be  
loc. sing. of *-ti*. *Sásni* in **c** is (with Grassmann) rendered as if  
it were *sásnis.*

Grown mighty in his strength, with ample vigour, he as a foe strikes fear into the Dasa, Eager to win the breathing and the breathless: All sang thy praise at banquet and oblation.
