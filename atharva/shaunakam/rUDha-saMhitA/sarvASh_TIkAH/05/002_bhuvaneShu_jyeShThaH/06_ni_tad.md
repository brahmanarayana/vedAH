### Translation
6. Thou didst set that down in the lower and the higher, in what abode  
(*duroṇá*) thou didst aid with aid; cause ye to stand there the moving  
mother; from it send ye many exploits.

### Notes
RV. and Ppp. put the verse after our 7. Ppp. has no variants; RV. reads  
in **a** *ávaram páraṁ ca*, and, for **c, d**, *ā́ mātárā sthāpayase  
jigatnū́ áta inoṣi kárvarā purū́ṇi:* a quite different, but little less  
obscure version of the text: "Indra checks the revolution of the sky, in  
order to gain time for his deeds." R.
