### Translation
8. These incantations (*bráhman*) may Brihaddiva, foremost  
heaven-winner, make, a strain (*śūṣá*) for Indra; he rules, an autocrat,  
over the great stall (*gotrá*); may he, quick (? *túra*), rich in  
fervor, send (?) all.

### Notes
The fourth pāda is attempted to be rendered literally from our text,  
although this is plainly a gross corruption of the RV. text: *dúraś ca  
víśvā avṛṇod ápa svā́ḥ*. RV. has also before it *svarā́jas*, and in **a**  
*vivakti* for *kṛṇavat*. Ppp. agrees with RV. throughout. *Svarṣā́s* (p.  
*svaḥ॰sā́ḥ*) is prescribed by Prāt. ii. 49.

Brihaddiva, the foremost of light-winners, hath made these holy prayers, this strength for Indra. Free Lord, he rules the mighty fold of cattle, winning, aglow, even all the billowy waters.
