### Translation
7. Embryo art thou of herbs, embryo of forest-trees, embryo of every  
existence; mayest thou, O Agni, set an embryo here.

### Notes
Compare vi. 95. 3, with which the verse is in considerable part  
identical. It is found also as VS. xii. 37, and in TS. iv. 2. 3³, MS.  
ii. 7. 10, in all with a different **d**: *ágne gárbho apā́m asi;* MS.  
further combines in **a** *gárbho ‘sy;* and in this last point Ppp.  
agrees with it.

Thou art the germ of plants and herbs, thou art the germ of forest trees, The germ of each existing thing, so here, O Agni, lay the germ.
