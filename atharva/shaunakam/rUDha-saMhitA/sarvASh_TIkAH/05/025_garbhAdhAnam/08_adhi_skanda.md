### Translation
8. Mount thou; play the hero; set an embryo in the womb; virile  
(*vṛ́ṣan*) art thou, that hast virility; for progeny do we conduct thee  
hither.

### Notes
Ppp. has *kranda* (for *skanda*) in **a**, and, for **c**, *vṛṣāṇaṁ  
vṛṣṇyāvantaṁ*. The verse occurs also in śGS. (i. 19. 6), which reads  
*kranda vīlayasva* in **a**, *sādhaya* (for *yonyām*) in **b**, *vṛṣāṇaṁ  
vṛṣann ā dhehi* for **c**, and *havāmahe* at the end. Our O. has  
*skandha vīḍay-* in **a**. The retention of the dental *s* of *skanda*  
is by Prāt. ii. 104.

Rise up, put forth thy manly strength, and lay thy germ within the womb. A bull art thou with vigorous strength: for progeny we bring thee near.
