### Translation
6. What king Varuṇa, or what divine Sarasvatī knows, what Indra the  
Vritra-slayer knows, that embryo-maker do thou drink.

### Notes
One or two of our mss. (P.W.) read *-bhaṁkár-* in **d**. Ppp. has for  
**b** *veda devo bṛhaspatiḥ*, and in **c** puts *yad* after *indras*.  
⌊See von Schroeder, *Tübinger Kaṭha-hss.*, p. 36.⌋
