### Translation
10. O Dhatar, with best form, in the two groins of this woman do thou  
set a male (*púmāṅs*) son, to be born in the tenth month.

### Notes
This verse also (like 2, above) occurs in the additions to RV. x. 184  
and to AGS. i. 14. 3 ⌊p. 37, transl.⌋ and in MP. ⌊i. 12.6⌋, with the  
variants: *víṣṇoḥ*\* for *dhā́taḥ* in **a**, and *asyā́m nā́ryāṁ gavīnyā́m*  
(MP. *-nyā̀m* ⌊in mss. E. and W., *-nyā́m* in the Oxford text⌋) for **b**;  
AGS. has *putrān* and MP. *gárbham* in **c**. Ppp. begins here a new  
hymn reading *savituś*† *śreṣṭhena* 1; *śreṣṭhena* 2; *viṣṇoḥ śreṣṭhena:  
tvaṣṭuḥ śreṣṭhena* 3. The other texts omit any such variants of vs. 10.  
⌊Cf. also MGS. ii. 18. 4 **c** and p. 156, s.v. *viṣṇoḥ*.⌋ \*⌊Oxford  
text, *víṣṇo*.⌋ †⌊Or else *bhaga* or *bhagaḥ*. Roth sent W. three notes  
on this vs. and they do not seem to agree. In **b** Ppp. has *nābhā* for  
*nāryā*.⌋

O Dhatar, thou Disposer, lay within the body of this dame. A male germ with the noblest form, for her, in the tenth month, to bear.
