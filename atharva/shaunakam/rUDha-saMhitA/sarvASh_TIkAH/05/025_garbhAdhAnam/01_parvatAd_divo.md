### Translation
1. Brought together from the cloud (? *párvata*), from the womb (*yóni*)  
of the sky, from every member, let the virile organ, seed-placer of the  
embryo, set (*ā-dhā*) \[it\] like the feather on the shaft.

### Notes
Or 'from the sky \[as\] womb.' That which is 'brought together' is the  
thing (seed) to be 'deposited.' The translation of **d** implies  
emendation to *śárāu;* Weber conjectures *tsarāu*. The insertion of the  
feather in the arrow-shaft is elsewhere also the subject of comparison  
as a work of effective skill; cf. RV. x. 18. 14 **b**. The verse is  
cited in Ppp. with its pratīka and *ity ekā* added, as if it had  
occurred earlier in the text; but it has not been discovered anywhere.  
The resolution of *-tāt* to *-taāt* in **a** is necessary to fill out  
the meter.

Let the man, sower of the germ, lay, as a feather on a shaft. Limb drawn from limb, whate'er is culled from cloud and from the womb of heaven.
