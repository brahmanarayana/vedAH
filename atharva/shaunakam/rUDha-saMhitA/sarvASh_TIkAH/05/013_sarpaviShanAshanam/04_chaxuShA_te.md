### Translation
4. With sight I smite thy sight; with poison I smite thy poison; die, O  
snake, do not live; let thy poison go back against thee.

### Notes
All the mss. ⌊including SPP's⌋ read *áhes* at beginning of **c**, but  
our edition makes the necessary emendation to *áhe*. Ppp. has for **a**  
*balena te balaṁ hanmi;* its **b** is wholly corrupt; for **c** etc. it  
reads *ṛṣaṇa hanmi te vidam ahe mariṣṭā mā jīvī praty anveta vā viṣaṁ*.  
⌊As for **d**—the later Hindus thought that snake poison did not hurt a  
snake; cf. *Indische Sprüche*, 3001. But see the interesting experiments  
of Sir Joseph Fayrer, in his *Thanatophidia of India*,² London, 1874, p.  
74-5. My colleague. Dr. Theobald Smith, Professor of Comparative  
Pathology, has most kindly examined for me the recent literature  
concerning the auto-toxic action of snake-venoms. The evidence is not  
conclusive as yet, but points to the immunity of snakes to  
snake-poison.—Cf. vii. 88, below.⌋

I with this eye destroy thine eye, and with this poison conquer thine. Live not, O Snake, but die the death: back go thy venom on thyself.
