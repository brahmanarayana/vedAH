### Translation
6. Of the Timātan (?) black serpent, of the brown, and of the waterless,  
of the altogether powerful (?), I relax the fury, as the bow-string of a  
bow; I release as it were chariots.

### Notes
The translation is as if the reading at end of **c** were *manyúm*.\*  
The *pada*-reading in **c** is *sātrā-sahásya*, according to Prāt. iii.  
23. Ppp. has *tayimātasya* in **a**, and in **c** *upodakasya*  
'water-haunting,' which is better. ⌊Whitney would doubtless have revised  
this carefully. The divergences of the translators reflect the  
uncertainties of the exegesis. 'I slacken as it were the cars of the  
wrath of' etc.—Griffith. 'I release (thee) from the fury of'  
etc.—Bloomfield. 'Des Asita...des Manyu Streitwagen gleichsam spanne  
⌊ich⌋ mir ab' or 'die Streitwagen des Grimmes des Asita' etc.—Weber. For  
**d**, 'as the string from off (*áva*) the bow.'⌋ \*⌊Ppp. reads  
*manyum.*⌋

Even as the cord that strings the bow, I slacken, as it were, the cars. Of the All-conquering serpent's wrath, of the fierce rage of Black, and Brown, Taimata, and Apodaka.
