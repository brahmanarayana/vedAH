### Translation
7. Both *ā́ligī* and *víligī*, both father and mother—we know your  
connection (*bándhu*) completely; sapless ones, what will ye do?

### Notes
The wholly obscure words in **a** (p. *ā́-ligī, ví-ligī*) might also be  
nom. m. of stems in *-in*; but their accent is against it. Ppp. reads,  
for **a, b**, *ālakā ca vyaca luptvā yas te mātā*. The Anukr. makes no  
account in **b** of the two syllables that are lacking to make an  
*anuṣṭubh* pāda.

And Aligi and Viligi, their father and the mother too,-- What will ye do? Your venomed sap, we know, is utterly powerless.
