### Translation
8. Daughter of the broad-knobbed one (?), born of the black barbarian  
(f.)—of all them (f.) that have pierced defiantly (?) the poison \[is\]  
sapless.

### Notes
The translation conjectures in **a** a relationship of *-gūla* to *gūḍa*  
and *gola*, and implies for **b** emendation to *dāsyā́ ásiknyāḥ*—since  
something had to be done to make the line translatable. ⌊One of SPP's  
authorities has *ásiknyāḥ*.⌋ Ppp. begins with *udakūlāyā* 'of the  
water-bank'; the rest of its version is "without meaning." The first  
word is quoted by the commentary to Prāt. iii. 72 in the form  
*urū-gūlāyāḥ* (so the ms.) ⌊*urŭ-*?⌋. ⌊W's version 'pierced' implies  
reference to root *dṛ* (not *drā* 'run,' as in *Index*). For  
*pratán̄kam*, both here and at iv. 16. 2, he first wrote 'rapidly,' and  
then interlined 'defiantly.' Why? BR. take it as gerund, 'of all that  
have run gliding': i.e., I suppose, 'that dart along on their bellies'?⌋
