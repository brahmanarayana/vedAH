### Comment
Found (except vs. 1) also in Pāipp. viii. (in the verse-order 3, 2, 4, 6, 5, 7-11). It is not quoted in Vāit.; but in Kāuś. 29. 1-14 all the verses are brought in in their order, in connection with a ceremony for healing poison-wounds; verse 1 (or the hymn) is also used at 48. 9, in a witchcraft rite. ⌊The London Anukr., in 6 places and for 7 poison-hymns, gives Garutmā (not -mān) as ṛṣi.⌋


### Translations
Translated: Griffith, i. 208; Bloomfield, 27, 425; Weber, xviii. 211.
