### Translation
3. A bull \[is\] my cry, like thunder through the cloud (*nábhas*); with  
thy formidable spell do I then drive it off (*bādh*) for thee; I have  
seized that juice of his with men ⌊?⌋; like light out of darkness let  
the sun arise.

### Notes
One is tempted to emend *nábhasā* in **a** to *-sas* or *-sām*, 'the  
thunder of the clouds.' Ppp. reads *tam* (which is better) *vacasā  
bādhāitu te* in **b**, *grabhis* for the strange *nṛbhis* ⌊Weber,  
'kräftig'⌋ in **c**, and *jyotiṣe ’va tamaso ’dayatu sāryaḥ* in **d**.  
The *i* of *iva* is uncounted in the meter of **d**. Kāuś. calls the  
verse *prasarjanī*.

Strong is my cry like thunder with the rainy cloud: with power- ful incantation let thy strength be stayed. I, with the men to aid, have seized that juice of his; as light from out the gloom, let Surya rise on high
