### Translation
1. Since Varuṇa, poet of heaven, hath given \[them\] to me, with  
formidable spells (*vácas*) do I dissolve thy poison; what is dug,  
undug, and attached (*saktá*) have I seized; like drink (*írā*) on a  
waste hath thy poison been wasted (*ni-jas*).

### Notes
The epithets in **c** are of obscure application: probably buried in the  
flesh by the bite, or unburied but clinging.

Varuna, Sage of heaven, hath given me the gift: with spells of mighty power I draw thy poison out. Dug up, not dug, adherent, I have seized it fast: low hath thy venom sunk like water in the sands.
