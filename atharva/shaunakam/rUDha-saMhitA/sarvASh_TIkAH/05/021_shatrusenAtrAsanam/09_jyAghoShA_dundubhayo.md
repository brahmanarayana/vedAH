### Translation
9. Let the drums, with bow-string noises, yell toward all (*yā́s*) the  
quarters—the armies of our enemies going conquered in troops.

### Notes
Or *jyāghoṣā́s* (as indicated by its accent) is independent noun, 'the  
noises of the bow-strings.' The verse seems rather out of order.

To all the quarters of the sky let clang of bowstrings and our Drums. Cry out to hosts of foes that go discomfited in serried ranks.
