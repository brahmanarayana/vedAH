### Translation
11. Do ye \[who are\] formidable, O Maruts, sons of the spotted mother,

The first half-verse is repeated below as xiii. 1. 3 **a, b**. The verse  
is translated by Muir (iv². 333). The Anukr. correctly reckons **c** as

or of the deficient one in **d**, perhaps reckoning them as balancing  
one another. The second half-verse would be better treated as  
constituting one paragraph (unmetrical) with our vs. 12.
