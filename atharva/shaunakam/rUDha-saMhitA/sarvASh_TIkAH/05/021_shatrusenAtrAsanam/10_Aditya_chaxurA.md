### Translation
10. O Āditya, take \[away their\] sight; ye beams, run after; let them  
that have foot-fastenings fasten on, the arm-power (*-vīryà*) being gone  
away.

### Notes
We should expect a passive verb in **c**, if *patsan̄gínīs*, as seems  
necessary, refers back to *sénās* in 9 **c**. It is apparently the enemy  
who are to be hampered in going, after losing their power of arm.

Aditya, take their sight away! Follow them close, ye motes of light. Let them cleave fast to foot-bound hosts when strength of arm hath past away.
