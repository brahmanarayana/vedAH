### Translation
12. Let these armies of the gods, sun-bannered, accordant, conquer our  
enemies: hail!

### Notes
This bit of prose, since it counts 24 syllables (6 + 9: 9), is called by  
the Anukr. a *gāyatrī*, and ill described as *yavamadhyā*, although its  
pādas **b** and **c** are equal. It is enumerated in the *gaṇamālā* (see  
Bloomfield's note to Kāuś. 14. 7) as belonging to the *aparājita gaṇa*.  
  
This fourth *anuvāka* has 6 hymns, with 83 verses, and the quotation  
(found only in Bp. and D.) is *ekatriṣaṣṭis tryaśītiḥ*, of which the  
first part is obscure.

May these embattled Gods, brilliant as Surya--All hail!--one- minded conquer those who hate us.
