### Translation
5. Now (not?) hast thou succeeded (*rādh*) by that, thou yonder  
(*asāú*): hail! having sharp weapons, having sharp missiles, very  
propitious, O Soma and Rudra, do ye be very gracious to us here.

### Notes
For *asāu* 'thou yonder' is doubtless to be used the name of the person  
addressed in practice: = O so-and-so. Ppp. reads for the first division  
of the verse *vītenāvāitenāmāitena rātsthīrar asāu svāhā*, which seems  
intended virtually to contain vss. 5-7; it has in **b, c** *tigmā-* and  
*suśevā ’gnīṣomāv iha;* and it puts the verse after our vs. 8. The Pet.  
Lex. makes the pertinent suggestion ⌊s.v. *anu + rādh*⌋ that *nú* at the  
beginning is for *ánu;* *nú* is nowhere in AV. found at the beginning of  
a pāda or clause—nor in RV. except as prolonged to *nū́*. Unhappily we  
get no help on the subject from the sense. ⌊Whitney's "(not?)" is not  
clear to me, unless it is meant to suggest emendation to *nāíténa* = *ná  
eténa*. If we read *ánu*, we must render, 'Thou hast succeeded by that.'  
But does not the Ppp. reading suggest rather *ví eténa arātsīs?*⌋

Through this now hast thou sent thy gifts. All hail! With sharpened arms and missiles, kind and friendly, be gracious unto us, Soma and Rudra!
