### Comment
⌊Verses 9-14 are prose; and so is verse 4, in part.⌋


Found also (except vss. 6, 7) in Pāipp. vi. The first four verses and the eleventh occur together in K. xxxviii. 14. As this hymn has the same first verse with iv. i, the quotation of the pratīka in Kāuś. does not at all show which of the two hymns is intended; but the schol. determine the question by adding the pratīka of vs. 2 also, and even, in a case or two, that of vs. 3; and the comm. to iv. 1 agrees with them. On this evidence, v. 6 appears in a battle-rite (15. 12) to show whether one is going to come out alive; in the citrākarman (18. 25), with i. 5 and 6 etc.; on occasion of going away on a journey (18. 27); in a healing rite (28.15) for the benefit of a child-bearing woman or of an epileptic ⌊see p. xlv. of Bloomfield's Introduction⌋; and in a ceremony for welfare (51. 7), with xi. 2; it is also reckoned (50. 13, note) to the rāudra gaṇa.
