### Translation
10. Whoever with sight, with mind, with intention, and whoever with  
design, malicious, shall attack us—do thou, O Agni, with weapon make  
them weaponless: hail!

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
TB. (as above) reads: *yó mā cákṣuṣā yó mánasā yó vācā́ bráhmaṇā ’ghāyúr  
abhidā́sati: táyā ’gne tvaṁ menyā ’múm ameníṁ kṛṇu*. Ppp. has in the last  
clause *tvam agne tvaṁ menyā ’meniṁ k-*. The metrical definition of this  
prose "verse" is unaccountably wrong.

Make with thy weapon weaponless, O Agni, all wicked men who deal with us as foemen with eye, with thought, with spirit, or intention.
