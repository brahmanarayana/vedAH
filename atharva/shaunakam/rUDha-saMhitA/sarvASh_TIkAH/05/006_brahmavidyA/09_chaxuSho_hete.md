### Translation
9. O missile (*hetí*) of sight, missile of mind, missile of incantation  
(*bráhman*), and missile of penance! weapon's weapon (*mení*) art thou;  
weaponless be they who show malice against us.

### Notes
With this verse and the next is to be compared TB. ii. 4. 2¹: *c. h. m.  
h. vā́co hete bráhmaṇo hete: yó ma ’ghāyúr abhidā́sati tám agne menyā́  
’meníṁ kṛṇu*, etc. ⌊Cf. Geldner, *Festgruss an Böhtlingk*, p. 32.⌋ The  
Anukr. omits any metrical definition of the verse. ⌊It seems rather to  
regard it as included under the general definition "*trāiṣṭubham.*"⌋
