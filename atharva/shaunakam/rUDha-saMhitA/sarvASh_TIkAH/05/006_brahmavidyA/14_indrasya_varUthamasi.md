### Translation
14. Indra's guard (*várūtha*) art thou; to thee etc. etc.

### Notes
The accent-mark which belongs under *tvā* in 12 and 13 is omitted in our  
text, and in 14 it has slipped out of place and stands under *taṁ*. The  
metrical definition is worthless, though each of the four verses  
contains not far from 40 syllables.

Indra's protection art thou. I betake me to thee, I enter thee with all my cattle. With all my people and with all my body, with all my soul, with mine entire possessions.
