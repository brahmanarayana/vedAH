### Translation
4. Round about do thou run forward in order to the winning of booty,  
round about overpowering adversaries (*vṛtrá*, n.); then thou goest over  
haters by the sea (*arṇavá*). Weakling (*sanisrasá*) by name art thou,  
the thirteenth month, Indra's house.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The first three pādas of the verse are RV. ix. 110. 1 (repeated, with  
*īrase* for *īyase* at the end, as SV. i. 428; ii. 714), which reads in  
**a** *dhanva* (without lengthening of the final), and has for **c**  
*dviṣás tarádhyā ṛṇayā́ na īyase;* of this our text appears to be a  
simple corruption. ⌊In the RV. version, *prá dhanva* (cf. ix. 109. 1  
**a**) and *ṛṇayā́ naḥ* seem to be insertions like those in AV. ii. 5.⌋  
Ppp. reads *sahasraśas* instead of *sanisrasas* in **d**, and in **c**  
*divas tad*, which comes nearer to making sense. The verse, with its  
prose ending, is most naturally divided as 12 + 8: 12 + 7 + 11 = 50; but  
the *pada*-mss. put the pāda division strangely after *trayodaśás*.

Speed forward, conquering all foes, to win the spoil, Thou comest on thy haters with a surging sea. Thy name is Fragile. The thirteenth month is Indra's home.
