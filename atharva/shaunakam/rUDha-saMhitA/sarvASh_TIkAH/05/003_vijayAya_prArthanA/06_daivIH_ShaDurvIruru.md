### Translation
6. Ye six divine wide ones, make wide \[space\] for us; all ye gods,  
revel here; let not a portent find us, nor an imprecation; let not the  
wrong that is hateful find us.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Only the first half-verse is RV. material, forming its vs. 5 with our 7  
**c, d**; the latter half-verse we have had already as i. 20. 1 **c,  
d**. RV. and TS. begin with *dévīs*, and end **b** with *vīrayadhvam;*  
and TS. oddly combines *ṣaḍurvīs* as a compound word; RV. reads *naḥ*  
after it, and TS. *ṇaḥ;* our mss. are divided between the two, but with  
a great preponderance for *ṇaḥ* (only E.I.H. have *naḥ*), so that it is  
more probably to be regarded as the AV. reading. Ppp. gives *uru nas  
karātha;* it has the second half-verse of the other texts. Some of our  
mss. accent *urvī́s* in **a** (Bp.P.M.K.), and some accent *devā́sas* in  
**b** (P.M.).

Ye six divine Expanses, give us freedom. Here, all ye Gods, acquit yourselves like heroes. Let not calamity or curse o'ertake us, nor deeds of wickedness that merit hatred.
