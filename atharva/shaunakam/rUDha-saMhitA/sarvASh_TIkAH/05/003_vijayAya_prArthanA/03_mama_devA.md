### Translation
3. Let all the gods be at my separate call—the Maruts with Indra,  
Vishṇu, Agni; let the broad-spaced atmosphere be mine; let the wind blow  
(*pū*) for me unto this desire.

### Notes
RV. reads at the end *kā́me asmín*, and Ppp. agrees with it, also TS. TS.  
has further *índrāvantas* in **b**, and in **c**, strangely enough, *urú  
gopám*, as two separate words.

May all the Gods be on my side in battle, the Maruts led by Indra, Vishnu, Agni. Mine be the middle air's extended region, and may the Wind blow favouring these my wishes.
