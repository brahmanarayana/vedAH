### Translation
2. O Agni, pushing back the fury of our adversaries, do thou, our keeper  
(*gopā́*), protect us about on all sides; let our abusers (*durasyú*) go  
away downwards; among themselves (*amā́*) let the intent of them awaking  
be lost.

### Notes
RV's version of **b, c** reads thus: *ádabdho gopā́ḥ pári pāhi nas tvám:  
pratyáñco yantu nigútaḥ púnas té;* and TS. has the same. But TS. also  
reads *agnís* at the beginning, *purástāt* for *páreṣām* in **a**, and  
*prabúdhā* in **d**. Ppp. has *prabudhā* for *nivátā* in **c**, and, for  
**d**, *mamīṣāṁ cittaṁ bahudhā vi naśyatu*. The verse is properly  
*svarāj*, **b** as well as **c** being *jagatī*. ⌊Correct *gāpā́ḥ* to  
*gopā́ḥ*.⌋

Baffling the range of our opponents, Agni! guard us as our protector round about us. Down the steep slope go they who hate us, backward, and let their thought who watch at home be ruined.
