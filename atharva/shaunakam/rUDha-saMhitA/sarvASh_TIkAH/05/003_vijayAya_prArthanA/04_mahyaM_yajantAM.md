### Translation
4. Let what sacrifices I make make sacrifice for me; let my mind's  
design be realized (*satyā́*); let me not fall into (*ni-gā*) any sin  
soever; let all the gods defend me here.

### Notes
RV. and TS. read *yajantu* and *havyā́* (for *iṣṭā́*) in **a**, and, for  
**d**, *víśve devāso ádhi vocatā naḥ* (but TS. *me*). Ppp. agrees with  
our text except for ending with *mām iha*.

For me let them present all mine oblations, and let my mind's intention be accomplished. May I be guiltless of the least transgression: may all the Gods come hither and protect me.
