### Translation
11. Hitherward do we call Indra from yonder, who is kine-conquering,  
riches-conquering, who is horse-conquering; let him hear this sacrifice  
of ours at our separate call; of us, O thou of the bay horses, hast thou  
been the ally (*medín*).

### Notes
The verse is found in TS., and in TB. (as above), and is the first of a  
long addition to RV. x. 128. All these read alike in **c, d**: *vihavé  
juṣasvā ’syá kurmo* (RV. *kulmo*) *harivo medínaṁ tvā;* Ppp. nearly  
agrees, reading instead *v. j. ’smākaṁ kṛṇvo h. m. tva*. The Anukr.  
apparently balances the redundancy of **a** against the deficiency of  
**b**.

Yea, we call Indra hitherward, the winner of wealth in battle and of kine and horses. May he mark this our worship when we call him, Lord of bay steeds, thou art our friend and comrade.
