### Translation
10. They that are our rivals—away be they; with Indra and Agni do we  
beat (*bādh*) them down; the Ādityas, the Rudras, sky-reaching (?  
*uparispṛ́ś*), have made our over-king a stern corrector.

### Notes
The other texts have *tā́n* for *enān* at end of **b**, and *akran* at  
end of **d**, and, for **c**, *vásavo rudrā́ ādityā́ uparispṛ́śam mā*,  
which makes better sense; they also accent *céttāram* in **d**. And VS.,  
which also has the verse (xxxiv. 46), agrees with them throughout. Ppp.  
presents instead a verse which is mostly found at TB. ii. 4. 3², next  
before the verse corresponding to our 11: *ihā ’rvāñcam ati hvaya indraṁ  
jāitrāya jetave: asmākam astu varṇaṁ yataṣ kṛṇotu vīryam* (instead of  
**c, d**, TB. has one  pāda: *asmā́kam astu kévalaḥ*). ⌊Our 10 occurs at  
the end of the hymn in Ppp., which reads in **a** *ye naś śapanty upa  
te*, in **b** *apa bādhāma yonim*, in **c** *mām* for *naḥ*, and ends  
with *akran*.⌋

Let those who are our foemen stay afar from us: with Indra and with Agni we will drive them off. The Adityas and the Rudras, over us on high, have made me strong, a thinker, and a sovran lord.
