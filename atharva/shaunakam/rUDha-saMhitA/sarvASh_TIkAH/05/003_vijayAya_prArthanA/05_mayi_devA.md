### Translation
5. On me let the gods bestow (*ā-yaj*) property; with me be blessing  
(*āśís*), with me divine invocation; may the divine invokers (*hótar*)  
win that for us; may we be unharmed with our self (*tanū́*), rich in  
heroes.

### Notes
RV. has for **c** *dāivyā́ hótāro vanuṣanta pū́rve;* and TS. the same,  
except *hótārā* and *vaniṣanta*. One or two of our mss. (Bp.H.) read  
*saniṣam* in **c**. Ppp. begins **a** with *mahyam*, and has *mama* for  
*mayi* both times in **b**.

May the Gods grant me riches, may the blessing and invocation of the Gods assist me. This boon shall the celestial Hotars win us: may we, unwound- ed, have brave heroes round us.
