### Translation
1. Be splendor mine, O Agni, in rival invocations (*vihavá*); may we,  
kindling thee, adorn ourselves; let the four directions bow to me; with  
thee as overseer may we conquer the fighters.

### Notes
The other texts (with MS. i. 4. 1) have no variants in this verse. Ppp.  
appears to read *prathema* for *puṣema* in **b**.

Let strength be mine while I invoke thee, Agni! enkindling thee may we support our bodies. May the four regions bend and bow before me: with thee for guardian may we win the combat.
