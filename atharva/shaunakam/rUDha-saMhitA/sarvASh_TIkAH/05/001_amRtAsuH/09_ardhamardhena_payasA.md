### Translation
9. Half with half milk thou mixest (? *pṛś*); with half, O Asura (?),  
thou increasest \[thy\] vehemence (?). We have increased the helpful  
(*śagmíya*) companion, Varuṇa, lively (*iṣirá*) son of Aditi;  
poet-praised wondrous forms have we spoken for him—the (two) firmaments  
(*ródasī*) of true speech.

### Notes
This translation implies several emendations (or, at least,  
alterations): in **b**, *śúṣmam*, which Ppp. has, instead of the  
vocative *śuṣma*, and *asura*, again with Ppp. (perhaps better *amūra*\*  
'not foolish'? cf. 11. 5, below); in **c**, *ávīvṛdhāma*, which also  
Ppp. gives, while one or two of our mss. offer *ávi॰vṛdhāma* (D.) and  
*avivṛdhāma* (Kp.). In **f** ought to be accented *ávocāma;* the  
*pada*-mss., as elsewhere in such cases, mark the pāda-division after  
the word, thus reckoning it to **e**, which is obviously wrong. Some of  
our mss. (O.D.K.) accent in **a** *pṛṇákṣi*, which is the better  
reading, the case being one of antithetical accent. Ppp. further has  
*śavasā* for *payasā* in **a**, *vardhayase ‘sura* in **b**, *aditer* in  
**d**, and *-vācāu* at the end. The verse (11 + 11: 11 + 11: 10 (9?) +  
11 = 65 \[64?\]) is more nearly an *aṣṭi* than an *atyaṣṭi*. \*⌊This is  
given by some of SPP's authorities.⌋

Halt with the milk, its other half, thou minglest and with that half, strong! unbeguiled! increasest. Let us exalt the gracious friend, the mighty, Varuna son of- Aditi, strength-giver. We have told him the marvels sung by poets. The utterance of Heaven and Earth is truthful.
