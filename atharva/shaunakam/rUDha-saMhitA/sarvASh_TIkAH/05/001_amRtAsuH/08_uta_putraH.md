### Translation
8. Also son prays (? *īḍ*) father for dominion; they called for  
well-being him of the chief bourn (?); may they see now, O Varuṇa, those  
that are thy shapes (*viṣṭhā́*); mayest thou make wondrous forms of the  
one much rolling hither.

### Notes
The translation implies emendation in **b** to the compound  
*jyeṣṭhámaryādam*,\* i.e. 'him who has received the best domain.' In  
**d** our *āvárvṛtatas* is for the *-rvrat-* of all the mss.; it can  
hardly be that the text of this pāda is not further corrupt. The verbs  
in **c, d** are augmentless forms, and may, of course, be rendered  
indicatively. Ppp- begins the verse with *putro vā yat pit-*, and ends  
**b** with *svasti*. The Kāuś. use of this verse and the next is  
apparently founded on the occurrence in them of "son" and "father" and  
"half." The second pāda is properly *jagatī*. \*⌊No ms. has *-dām*.⌋

Yea, the son asks dominion of his father: this they declared the noblest path to welfare. Varuna, let them see thy revelations: display the wondrous shapes of times to follow.
