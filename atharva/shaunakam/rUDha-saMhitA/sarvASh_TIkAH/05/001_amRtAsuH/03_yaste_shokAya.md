### Translation
3. He who left (*ric*) \[his\] body to thy heat (*śóka*), flows the  
gold; his \[men\] are bright (*śúci*) after; there they (two) assume  
(*dhā*) immortal names; let the clans (*víś*) send garments for us.

### Notes
The first pāda might equally mean "he who left thy body (self) to the  
heat." In **b**, *kṣárat* might equally be pres. pple. qualifying  
*híraṇyam*. In **d** the translation assumes the reading *asmé* instead  
of *asmāí;* nearly all the mss. have the former (p. *asmé íti;* P.M.W.  
have *asmāí*, but doubtless only by the not infrequent error of  
substituting *āi* for *e*), and our understanding of the sense is too  
defective to justify emendations; Ppp., however, has *asmi*. In **c**,  
Ppp. reads *atra dadhṛṣe ‘mṛt-*. The Kāuś. use of the verse appears to  
be derived only from the occurrence of *vástrāṇi* in **d**.
