### Translation
2. He who first attained to (*ā-sad*) the ordinances (*dhárman*) makes  
thence many wondrous forms; eager (? *dhāsyú*) he first entered the womb  
(*yóni*), he who understood (*ā-cit*) speech unspoken.

### Notes
In **b** the translation follows Ppp., which reads *kṛṇute* for *-uṣe;*  
Ppp. also has a different **c**, *yaś ca yoniṁ prathamā ”viveśa;* and it  
ends **d** with *anucitāṁ jigāya.*

He who, the first, approached the holy statutes makes, after, many beauteous forms and figures. Eager to drink, his birth-place first he entered who understands the word when yet unspoken.
