### Translation
6. Seven bourns (*maryā́dā*) did the poets fashion; unto one of these  
verily went one distressed; in the nest of the nearest (*upamá*)  
community (? *āyú*) stood the pillar (*skambhá*), at the release  
(*visargá*) of the roads, in the supports (*dharúṇa*).

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The verse is a RV. one, from a mystic and obscure hymn (x. 5. 6); RV.  
puts *íd* after *ékām* in **b**, and in **c** accents *upamásya nīḍé*,  
which alone is acceptable; all our mss. give *úpamasya*, which our  
edition follows; and all save one (D.) read *nīḍe* without accent, which  
we emended to *nīḍé*. Ppp. gives in **b** *tāsām anekām*, and omits,  
probably by an oversight, the second half-verse. "The life of mankind is  
compared to a racetrack, on which the gods have marked many (seven)  
stations; each generation (*yuga*) reaches only one such goal, getting  
as far as the place where the next begins; there its road terminates."  
R.

Seven are the pathways which the wise have fashioned: to one of these may come the troubled mortal. On sure ground where the ways are parted standeth Life's Pillar in the dwelling of the Highest.
