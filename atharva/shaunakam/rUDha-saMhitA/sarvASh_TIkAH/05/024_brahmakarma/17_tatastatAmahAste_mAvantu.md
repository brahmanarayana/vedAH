### Translation
17. The Fathers (*tatá*), the grandfathers (*tatāmahá*)—let them favor  
etc. etc.

### Notes
The translation implies emendation to *tatā́s* at the beginning of vs.  
17, as the sense seems to require, and as the other texts suggest. Ppp.  
combines vss. 15-17, reading *pitaras pare ‘varas tatas tadāmahas te mā*  
etc.; TS. (iii. 4. 5: and PGS.), *pítaraḥ pitāmahāḥ pare ‘vare tátās  
tatāmahā ihá mā* etc.; TS. iv. 3. 3², *pitáraḥ pitāmahā́ḥ páré ‘vare té  
naḥ* etc., with which MS. agrees. Two of our mss. (O.D.) begin vs. 17  
with *tatás tat-*; the rest have *tátas*, and our printed text follows  
them.

Next may the Fathers of our fathers save me, in this my prayer,. in this mine act, in this my sacerdotal charge, in this perfor- mance, in this thought, in this my plan and wish, in this my calling on the Gods! All hail!
