### Translation
3. Heaven-and-earth are overlords of givers; let them favor etc. etc.

### Notes
Literally, 'are overladies' (*ádhipatnī*). Neither Ppp. nor the other  
texts have anything corresponding to this verse. As in a number of other  
similar cases, the mss. make very awkward work of writing the *tṝ* of  
*dātṝṇām*, the majority (Bp.P.M.W.H.E.T.) giving instead *tre*, one (I.)  
*trṛ*, one (K.) *ttṛ*, and a few (O.D.R.) correctly *tṝ;* the edited  
text has wrongly *trā*.
