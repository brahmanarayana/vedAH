### Translation
1. Savitar ('the impeller') is overlord of impulses; let him favor  
(*av*) me, in this worship (*bráhman*), in this rite (*kárman*), in this  
representation (*purodhā́*), in this firm-standing, in this intent, in  
this design, in this benediction (*āśís*), in this invocation of the  
gods: hail!

### Notes
This is the tenth item in Ppp.; TS. (with PGS.) and śśS. have the same.  
The Ppp. order of actions is different, and includes fewer members:  
*brahman, karman, purodhā, devahūti, ākūti, āśis* (*āśiṣas* ⌊so! twice⌋  
*svāhā*); TS. and PGS. give *bráhman, kṣatrá, āśís, purodhā́, kárman,  
deváhūti;* MS., *bráhman, purodhā́, kárman, āśís, deváhūti;* śśS.,  
*brahman, kṣatra, karman, āśis, pratiṣṭhā, devahūti*. The Anukr. text is  
in part confused and doubtful, and the inaccuracies of its metrical  
definitions of the parts of the hymn are not worth tracing out and  
noting. In our edition, the accent mark under the first syllable of  
*ā́kūtyām* is a misprint, and to be removed.

Savitar, Lord of furthering aids, protect me, in this my prayer, in this mine act, in this my sacerdotal charge, in this perfor- mance, in this thought, in this my plan and wish, in this my calling on the Gods! All hail!
