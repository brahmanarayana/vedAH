### Translation
8. Made by devices (*dhī́*), may it speak forth its voice; excite thou  
the weapons of the warriors; allied with Indra, call in the warriors; by  
friends smite mightily down the enemies.

### Notes
'By devices': i.e., apparently, with art. Emendation of *vadāti* to  
*vadāsi* in **a** is very desirable; Ppp. has the 2d pers. *bharasva*  
instead; and, as noted above, it substitutes our 6 **c, d** for the  
second half-verse. There is a syllable lacking in **a**.

He shall send forth his voice whom art hath fashioned. Make thou the weapons of our warriors bristle. With Indra for ally call out our heroes, and with thy friends scatter and chase the foemen
