### Translation
5. Hearing the uttered (*pra-yam*) voice of the drum speaking, let the  
woman, suppliant, noise-wakened, run to her son, seizing his hand—our  
enemy, frightened in the conflict of deadly weapons.

### Notes
One might conjecture in **a** *prayatā́m* 'of \[us\] advancing.' This  
verse and 6 and 9 are really the only regular *triṣṭubhs* of the hymn.

Hearing the Drum's far-reaching voice resounding, let the foe's dame, waked by the roar, afflicted, Grasping her son, run forward in her terror amid the conflict of the deadly weapons.
