### Translation
12. Stirring (*cyu*) the unstirred, going oftenest into contests,  
conquering scorners, going in front, unsubduable, made safe by Indra,  
noting counsels (? *vidátha*), burning the hearts of our adversaries, go  
thou quickly.

### Notes
The abbreviated combination *hṛdyo-* for *hṛddyo-* has led here, as at  
i. 22. 1, to the *pada*-reading *hṛ॰dyótanaḥ* in **d**. The defective  
meter of **a** (which is not to be honestly removed by resolving *cy*  
into *ci*) makes the reading suspicious (perhaps *samádane?*). Ppp. has  
*pṛtanāṣāt* for *puraetā* in **b**, and *kḷptas* for *guptas* in **c**.  
*Vidáthā* in **c**, perhaps 'the gatherings of our enemies'; ⌊see  
Geldner, ZDMG. lii. 746⌋.
