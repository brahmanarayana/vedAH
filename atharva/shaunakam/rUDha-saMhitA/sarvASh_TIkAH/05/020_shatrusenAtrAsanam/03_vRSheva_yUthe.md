### Translation
3. Found (*vidāná*) suddenly (*sáhasā*) like a bull in a herd, do thou,  
seeking kine, bellow (*ru*) at \[them\], winning booty; pierce thou with  
pain the heart of our adversaries; let our foes, leaving their villages,  
go urged forth (*pra-cyu*).

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **a** *yūthaṁ saha sa-*, and in **c** *viddhi*. The Anukr.  
notes no irregularity in the verse, although **d** is clearly  
*jagatī*-pada, and to resolve *vidhia* in **c** is contrary to all  
analogy.

Like a bull marked by strength among the cattle, roar seeking kine and gathering up the booty. Pierce through our adversaries' heart with sorrow, and let our routed foes desert their hamlets.
