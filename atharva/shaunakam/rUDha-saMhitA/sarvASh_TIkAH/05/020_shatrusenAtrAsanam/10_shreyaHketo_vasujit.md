### Translation
10. Aiming at advantage, conquering good things, very powerful,  
conquering a host, thou art sharpened by *bráhman;* as the  
pressing-stone on the \[soma-\] stalks in the press, do thou, O drum,  
dance on \[their\] possession, seeking booty (*gavyán*).

### Notes
The translation implies emendation of *gavyám* (read by all our mss.) in  
**d** to *gavyán* as made in our edited text; but *gavyám védas* might  
perhaps mean 'their possession in kine.' Prāt. ii. 62 prescribes  
*śreyaḥketas* (not *-yask-*). Bp. alone reads *ádhriḥ* in **c**, which  
Pet. Lexx. prefer; *adris* is, to be sure, superfluous beside *grā́vā*,  
and can hardly be translated. Ppp. has, for **b**, *mitraṁ dadhānas  
tviṣito vipaścit;* and it reads *adhi* (not *‘dhi*) in **d**. The first  
pāda is defective, unless we make the violent resolution *śr-e-* at the  
beginning; in the third we have to read *’va* ⌊or *‘driḥ*⌋.

Bent on advantage, mightier, gaining treasures, victor in war, the spell hath made thee keener. As, in the press, the stone to stalks of Soma, thus, Drum! go dancing to our foes' possessions.
