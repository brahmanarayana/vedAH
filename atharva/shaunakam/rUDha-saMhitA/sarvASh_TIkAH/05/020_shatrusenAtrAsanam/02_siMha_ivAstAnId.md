### Translation
2. Like a lion hath thundered the wooden one, stretched (*vi-bandh*),  
like a bull roaring at a longing cow; virile (*vṛ́ṣan*) \[art\] thou,  
impotent thy rivals; Indra-like \[is\] thy vehemence (*śúṣma*),  
overpowering hostile plotters.

### Notes
The translation implies emendation to *vāśitā́m* in **b**, as made in our  
edition; the mss. *vāsitā́m*. All the *saṁhitā*-mss. (after their usual  
custom: see my *Skt. Gr.* §232) abbreviate in **a** to *-nīdruv-*, and  
many of them (P.M.W.E.H.O.) have the misreading *-nīdhruv-*. The  
*pada*-text does not divide *druváyah*, but the case is quoted in the  
comment to Prāt. iv. 18 as an exceptional one, *vaya* being regarded as  
a suffix added to *dru*. Ppp. reads at the beginning  
*siṅhāivāttānīdruvayo*, and combines *śuṣmo ‘bhi-* in **d**. The Anukr.  
notes no irregularity in the verse—as if it abbreviated *iva* to *’va*  
in both **a** and **b**.

The fastened frame hath roared as 'twere a lion, like a bull bel- lowing to meet the heifer. Thou art a bull, thine enemies are weaklings: thine is the foe- subduing strength of Indra.
