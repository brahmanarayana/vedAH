### Translation
7. Let there be noise between these two firmaments (*nábhas*); severally  
let thy sounds (*dhvaní*) go swiftly; roar at \[them\], thunder,  
truculent (?), resounding (*ślokakṛ́t*) unto the victory of our friends,  
a good partizan.

### Notes
*Mitra* in *mitratū́rya* has to be taken as subjective instead of  
objective genitive. It is only with difficulty (*iantu?*) that **b** can  
be made metrically complete ⌊unless we read *táva* for *te*⌋. Ppp. reads  
at the end *śraddhī*. ⌊Bloomfield discusses *utpípāna*, AJP. xii. 441.⌋

Loud be thy roar between the earth and heaven. Swift let thy sounds go forth in all directions. Neigh at them, thunder, set in opposition, song-maker, good ally that friends may conquer.
