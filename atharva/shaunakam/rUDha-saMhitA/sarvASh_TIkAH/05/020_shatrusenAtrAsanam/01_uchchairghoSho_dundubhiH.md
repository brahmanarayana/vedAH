### Translation
1. The loud-noised drum, warrior-like, of forest-tree, brought together  
(*sámbhṛta*) with the ruddy \[kine\], whetting the voice, dominating our  
rivals; thunder thou loudly against \[them\] like a lion, about to  
conquer.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
That is (**b**), made of wood and bound and headed with cowhide. The  
mss. make awkward work of writing *kṣṇuvānás;* nearly all have *kṣuṇu-*,  
only Bp.² *kṛṇuv-*, and E. *kṣuv-*; but there cannot well be any  
question as to the true reading. In **d**, also, most of the mss. have  
the obviously wrong *jyeṣyán*, only H.E. *jeṣ-*. The Anukr. strangely  
reckons the verse (though it is a perfectly regular *triṣṭubh*) as a  
*jagatī*, apparently only on account of the unnecessary full reading  
*iva* (for *’va*) in **d**: or can it perhaps count also *kṣuṇuvāno* as  
four syllables? Ppp. has *khaṇvāno;* in **d** it reads *siṁha iva  
dveṣaṁn* (= *hreṣann?*) *abhi taṅstanayati*.

Formed out of wood, compact with straps of leather, loud is the: War-drum as he plays the hero. Whetting thy voice and vanquishing opponents, roar at them like a lion fain to conquer!
