### Translation
12. O Aśvins, come ye hitherward with worship (*bráhman*), with  
*váṣaṭ*-utterance increasing the sacrifice. O Brihaspati, come  
hitherward with worship; this sacrifice \[is\] heaven (*svàr*) here for  
the sacrificer: hail!

### Notes
Ppp. has instead, for **d**, *yajñaṁ vayaṁ svaritaṁ yajamānāya dhehi  
svāhā*. The Anukr. would have us read the last pāda as 15 syllables, and  
calls the verse a *jagatī* because amounting to 48 syllables, though the  
first three pādas are regularly *triṣṭubh*.  
  
With this hymn ends the fifth *anuvāka*, of 5 hymns and 69 verses; the  
Anukr. citation is *navā ’paraḥ;* and Bp.D. add further *aparā ṣaṣṭe  
navā ’paraḥ* (Bp. *-raṁ ca cā ’nuvākaḥ*).
