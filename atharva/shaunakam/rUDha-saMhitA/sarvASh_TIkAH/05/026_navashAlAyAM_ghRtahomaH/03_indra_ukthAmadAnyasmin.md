### Translation
3. Let Indra, foreknowing, at this sacrifice join songs and revels  
(*ukthāmadá*), the well-joined ones (?): hail!

### Notes
Ppp. reads and combines *sayujas sv-*. The mechanical definition of the  
Anukr. implies a division into 7 + 7 + 8 syllables. There is some  
blundering of the mss. over *ukthāmadā́ni*, B. appearing to read  
*ukya-m-*, and P.W. *uktām-*. *Suyújas*, here and in vss. 7-11, may be  
genitive 'of the well-joined one'; it does not agree in gender with the  
nouns that precede ⌊aside from *āśíṣo*⌋.

In this great rite--All hail!--may sapient Indra use lauds, rejoicings, well-yoked coursers.
