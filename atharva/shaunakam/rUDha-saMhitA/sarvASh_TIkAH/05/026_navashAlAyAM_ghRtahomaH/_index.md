### Comment
⌊Partly unmetrical.⌋ Found also in Pāipp. ix. (in verse-order 1-3, 5, 4, 6-8, 11, 10, 9, 12). Quoted in Kāuś. 23. 1, in a ceremony of consecration of a new house, and given in the paddhati (see note to Kāuś. 19. i) among the puṣṭika mantras. Used in Vāit. 16. 6 in counteracting an enemy's soma-offering (agniṣṭoma); and vs. 12 a, b in 19. 4, also in the agniṣṭoma, with a cup for the Aśvins. Neither treatise teaches us anything whatever as to the real meaning of the hymn. The matter is in considerable part metrical, though in part also too irregular to be so called.
