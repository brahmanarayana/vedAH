### Translation
9. Let Bhaga join now for him the blessings (*āśís*); at this sacrifice  
let him, foreknowing, join the well-joined ones: hail!

### Notes
Ppp. combines *asmā ’smin*, and reads *sayujas*, as above. The Anukr.  
evidently reckons three pādas, of 11 + 7 + 8 syllables.

Let Bhaga in this rite use prayers, foreknowing--All hail! for this use well-yoked coursers.
