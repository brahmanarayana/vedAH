### Translation
7. My stone-defense art thou; whoever from the intermediate quarters of  
the quarters etc. etc.

### Notes
O. is the only ms. that fills out the paragraphs between 1 and 7; and it  
leaves *aghāyúr* unelided in all the verses. In paragraph 7 of our  
edition the accent-mark has dropped out under the *va* of *aśmavarmá*.  
The Anukr. reads 7 + 16: 5 = 28 syllables.

Thou art my wall of stone against the sinner who from points intermediate fights against me. May he encounter it!
