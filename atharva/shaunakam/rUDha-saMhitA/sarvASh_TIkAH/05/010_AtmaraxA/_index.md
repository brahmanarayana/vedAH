### Comment
⌊This piece is prose.⌋ This piece, like the preceding, is wanting in Pāipp. Parts of vss. 1-7 are apparently used by Kāuś. in a magic rite (49. 7-9); and certainly those verses are quoted in a ceremony (51. 14) for the welfare of the house with burying ⌊five⌋ stones in its corners ⌊and middle and putting a sixth above it⌋; and the hymn is reckoned (8. 23, note) to the vāstu gaṇa; while vs. 8 appears, with vi. 53 and vii. 67, in the savayajñas (66. 2). In Vāit. (29. 11) the verses are addressed to the stones of enclosure in the agnicayana.
