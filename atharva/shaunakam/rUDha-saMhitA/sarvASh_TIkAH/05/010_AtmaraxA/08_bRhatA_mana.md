### Translation
8. By the great one (*bṛhát*) I call unto mind; by Mātariśvan, unto  
breath and expiration; from the sun \[I call\] sight, from the  
atmosphere hearing, from the earth body; by Sarasvatī, mind-yoked, we  
call unto speech.

### Notes
The verse divides most naturally as 9 + 9: 16: 16 = 50; the metrical  
definition of the Anukr. fits it very ill. ⌊For **c**, cf. v. 7. 5.⌋  
  
The second *anuvāka* ends here, and contains 5 hymns and 49 verses; the  
old Anukr. says *ādyāt para ekādaśahīnaṣaṣṭiḥ*.

With Brihat I invoke the mind, with Matarisvan both the breaths, The eye from Surya, and the ear from Air, the body from the Earth. We, with Sarasvati who suits the mind, call Speech to come to us.
