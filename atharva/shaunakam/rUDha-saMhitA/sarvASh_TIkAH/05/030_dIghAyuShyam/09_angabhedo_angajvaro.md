### Translation
9. The splitter of limbs, the waster of limbs, and the heart-ache that  
is thine, the *yákṣma* hath flown forth like a falcon, forced (*sah*)  
very far away by \[my\] voice.

### Notes
The form *sāḍhá* is noted in Prāt. iii. 7. Ppp. has for **a**  
*śīrṣarogam an̄garogam*, combines *śyenāi ’va* in **c**, and reads  
*nuttas* for *sāḍhas* in **d** ⌊and *vācā?*⌋. The Anukr. ignores the  
abbreviation of *iva* to *’va* in **c**.

Gone is the pain that racked thee, gone thy fever, gone thy heart's disease. Consumption, conquered by my voice, hath, like a hawk, fled far away.
