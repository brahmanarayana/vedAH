### Translation
4. In that thou art prostrate (*śī*) from sin that is mother-committed  
and that is father-committed, deliverance and etc. etc.

### Notes
Grohmann and Zimmer (p. 395) understand here 'sin committed against  
mother or father': doubtless wrong.

If thou art lying there because of mother's or of father's sin, I with my voice declare to thee thy freedom and release there- from.
