### Translation
13. Let breath come, let mind come, let sight come, then strength; let  
his body assemble (? *sam-vid*); let that stand firm with its (two)  
feet.

### Notes
⌊In **a, b**, the order of the items of the return to life is (if  
inverted) in noteworthy accord with that of the items of the process of  
death, both in fact and also as set forth in the Upanishads—e.g. ChU.  
vi. 15.⌋
