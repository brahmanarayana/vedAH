### Translation
16. This much-quivering tongue, bound, speaks within; by it I have  
exorcised the *yákṣma* and the hundred pangs of the fever.

### Notes
Ppp. reads for **b, c** *ugrajihvā paṇiṣpadā tayā romaṁ nir ayāsaḥ:*.  
Our edition reads *tváyā*, with all the mss., at the beginning of **c**,  
but it must of course be emended to *táyā*, as translated. The Anukr.  
takes no notice of the lacking syllable in **a**, which no resolution  
can supply. *Paniṣpadā* in **b** is prescribed by Prāt. iv. 96.

Tied, tremulously moving, here the tongue is speaking in the mouth. With thee I charmed Decline away and Fever's hundred ago- nies.
