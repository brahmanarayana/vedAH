### Translation
6. Be thou here, O man, together with thy whole mind; go not after  
Yama's (two) messengers; go unto the strongholds of the living.

### Notes
The Anukr. takes no notice of the defective first pāda; the addition of  
*evá* (cf. 1 **c**) after *ihá* would be an easy and natural  
filling-out. Ppp. has for **a** *ehi ehi punar ehi*, and reads *hi* for  
*ihi* in **d**.

O man, stay here among us; stay with all thy spirit: follow not Yama's two messengers. Approach the castles where the living dwell.
