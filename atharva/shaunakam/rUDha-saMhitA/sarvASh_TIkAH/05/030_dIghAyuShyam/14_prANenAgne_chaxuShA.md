### Translation
14. With breath, O Agni, with sight unite him; associate (*sam-īray*)  
him with body, with strength; thou understandest immortality (*amṛ́ta*):  
let him not now go; let him not now become one housing in the earth.

### Notes
Most of our mss. (not B.I.T.K.) appear to read *tú* instead of *nú* in  
**d**. Instead of *nu gāt* in **c**, Ppp. gives *mṛta*, and it has *mo  
ṣu* for *mā nu* in **d**: both are better readings.

Provide this man with breath and sight, O Agni, and with his body and his strength unite him. Thou knowest Amrit: let him not go hence, nor dwell in house of clay.
