### Translation
8. Born in the north from the snowy \[mountain\], thou art conducted to  
people (*jána*) in the eastern \[quarter\]; there have they shared out  
the highest names of the *kúṣṭha*.

### Notes
"The highest names": i.e. the chief sorts or kinds ⌊brands, as we  
moderns say⌋. The reading *údān* in **a** is assured by quotation under  
Prāt. iii. 27. Ppp. reads *prācyaṁ* in **b**.
