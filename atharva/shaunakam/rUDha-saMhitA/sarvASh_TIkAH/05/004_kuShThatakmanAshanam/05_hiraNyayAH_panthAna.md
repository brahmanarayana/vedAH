### Translation
5. Golden were the roads, the oars golden, the ships were golden by  
which they brought out the *kúṣṭha*.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *hiraṇmay-*, and omits **c** (doubtless by an oversight). All  
the mss. agree in accenting *áritrāṇi;* but this should doubtless be  
emended to *arít-*. In **a** we may emend to *pánthās* or combine  
*pánthānā ”san*.

They sailed on pathways paved with gold, the oars they piled were wrought of gold: All golden were the ships wherein they carried Kushtha down to earth.
