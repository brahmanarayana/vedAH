### Translation
1. Thou that wast born on the mountains, strongest of plants, come, O  
*kúṣṭha*, effacer (*-nā́śana*) of *takmán*, effacing the fever (*takmán*)  
from here.

### Notes
The *kuṣṭha* is identified as *Costus speciosus* or *arabicus*. The  
*pada*-text reads in **c** *kúṣṭha: ā́: ihi;* and the passage is quoted  
as an example under Prāt. iii. 38, which teaches the combination.
