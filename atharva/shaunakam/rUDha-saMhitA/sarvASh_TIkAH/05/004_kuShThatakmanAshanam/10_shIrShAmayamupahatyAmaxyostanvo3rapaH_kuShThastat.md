### Translation
10. Head-disease, attack (? *upahatyā́*), evil of the eyes, of the  
body—all that may *kúṣṭha* relieve, verily a divine virility (*vṛ́ṣṇya*).

### Notes
The reading *níṣ karat* in **c** falls under Prāt. ii. 63. All the mss.  
give *akṣós*, but the proper reading is plainly *akṣyós*, as the meter  
shows; the same error is found also in other passages. The Anukr.  
implies *akṣós*, as *akṣyós* (*-ṣi-ós*) would make the verse a regular  
anuṣṭubh. The Pet. Lexx. take *upahatyā́m* as governing *akṣyós*, and so  
render it 'blinding.' ⌊Ppp. has for a *śīrṣahatyām upahatya*, and for  
**c** *kuṣṭho no viśvatas pād.*⌋
