### Translation
3. The *aśvatthá*, seat of the gods, in the third heaven from here;  
there the gods won the *kúṣṭha*, the sight (*cákṣaṇa*) of immortality  
(*amṛ́ta*).

### Notes
Or, perhaps, an image or likeness of the *amṛ́ta* (drink). This verse and  
the next are repeated below as vi. 95. 1, 2, and again, with slight  
variations, as xix. 39. 6, 7. The second pāda occurs elsewhere in sundry  
places, as ChU. viii. 5. 3, HGS. ii. 7. 2. With **c** compare RV. i. 13.  
5; 170. 4.
