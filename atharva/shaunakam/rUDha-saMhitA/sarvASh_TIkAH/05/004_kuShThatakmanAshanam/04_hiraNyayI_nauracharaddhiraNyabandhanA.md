### Translation
4. A golden ship, of golden tackle (*-bándhana*), moved about in the  
sky; there the gods won the *kúṣṭha*, the flower of immortality.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Most of the mss. appear to read *avarat* in **a**, but doubtless only  
owing to the imperfect distinction of *ca* and *va* in most Sanskrit  
writing. So also, for the same reason, in **c**, they could be read for  
the most part as either *púṣyam* or *púṣpam* (M. has *puṣyàm*); the  
former was adopted in our edition as being favored by the meter.
