### Translation
6. Triply born by birth \[is\] this gold: one was Agni's dearest; one  
fell away of Soma when injured; one they call the seed of devout waters;  
let that triple gold be thine in order to life-time.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Instead of *vedhásām* in **d**, a much easier reading would be  
*vedhásas* nom. (as tacitlyemended by Ludwig); and this is favored by  
Ppp., which has *vedaso retā ”hus;* it further gives in **e**  
*trivṛtāstu te*. With **bcd** compare TB. i. 1. 3⁸. The name  
*atiśakvarī* given to the verse by the Anukr. demands 60 syllables, but  
only 57 (11 + 11 + 12: 11 + 12) can be fairly counted.

This gold, born threefold at its first production, grew the one thing that Agni loved most dearly: it fell away, one part of injured Soma. One part they call seed of the sapient Waters. This gold bring thee long life when triply threaded!
