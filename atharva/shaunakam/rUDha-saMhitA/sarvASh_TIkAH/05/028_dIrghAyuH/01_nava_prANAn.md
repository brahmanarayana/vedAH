### Translation
1. Nine breaths with nine he combines (? *sam-mā*), in order to length  
of life for a hundred autumns; in the yellow (*hárita*), three; in  
silver, three; in iron (? *áyas*), three—enveloped with fervor.

### Notes
'Yellow,' doubtless 'gold.' Ppp. reads *rajasā* for *tapasā* in **d**.  
The second half-verse can hardly be called anything but prose, though  
the Anukr. takes it as good *triṣṭubh* meter. It appears doubtful  
whether this verse belongs with the rest, and whether the nine  
*prāṇagrahas*, or the nine verses of the *trivṛt stoma*, are not rather  
intended in it.

For lengthened life, to last through hundred autumns, they equalize with nine the nine aspirations. Three in gold, three in silver, three in iron by heat are stablished in their several places.
