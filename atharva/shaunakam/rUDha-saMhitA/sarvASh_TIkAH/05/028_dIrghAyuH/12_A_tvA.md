### Translation
12. Let Aryaman fasten (*cṛt*) thee on, let Pūshan, let Brihaspati; what  
is the name of the day-born one, therewith we fasten thee over.

### Notes
For the obscure third pāda compare iii. 14. 1. The verse is a regular  
*anuṣṭubh*, if **b** is properly read, as *ā́ pūṣā́ ā́ bṛ́haspátiḥ* (so the  
*pada*-text). This and the two following verses, which are not found in  
Ppp., seem to be independent of what precedes.

Aryaman be thy binder-on, and Pushan and Brihaspati: Whatever name the brood of day possess, therewith we fasten thee.
