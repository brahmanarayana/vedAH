### Translation
2. Fire, sun, moon, earth, waters, sky, atmosphere, directions, and  
quarters, they of the seasons in concord with the seasons—let them  
rescue (*pāray*) me by this triple one.

### Notes
The verse, as was noted above, is wanting in Ppp. One and another ms.,  
here as later, reads *tṛvṛ́t*. To fill out the meter of **c** we have to  
make the harsh and unusual resolution of the first *ā* of *ārtavās*.

May Agni, Sun, and Moon, and Earth, and Waters, Sky, Air, the Quarters and the Points between them, And Parts of Years accordant with the Seasons by this three- threaded Amulet preserve me.
