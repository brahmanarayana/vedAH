### Translation
3. Let three abundances (*póṣa*) resort to the triple one; let Pūshan  
anoint it with milk, with ghee; affluence of food, affluence of man  
(*púruṣa*), affluence of cattle—let these resort hither.

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **a** *trivṛtaś;* in **c** *anyasya*, and *bhāumā* both  
times (*bhū-* in **d**). We need in **a** to resolve *tṛ-ayaḥ*.
