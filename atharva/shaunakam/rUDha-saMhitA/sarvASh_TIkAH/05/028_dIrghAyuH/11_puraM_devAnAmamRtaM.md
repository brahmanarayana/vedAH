### Translation
11. The stronghold of the gods, deathless (*amṛ́ta*) gold, what god first  
bound on in the beginning, to him I pay homage, \[my\] ten extended  
\[fingers\]; let him approve my binding-on the triple one.

### Notes
Ppp. has at the end *trivṛtā vadhena*. The translation implies in **d**  
the reading *manyatām*, which is given in our edition, though against  
part of the mss., that read *manyantām*. ⌊'Let him (or it) assent to my  
binding-on,' dative infinitive.⌋

The God who first bound on in the beginning the deities' im- mortal golden castle,-- Him I salute with ten extended fingers. Blest be the three- stringed charm I bind upon thee.
