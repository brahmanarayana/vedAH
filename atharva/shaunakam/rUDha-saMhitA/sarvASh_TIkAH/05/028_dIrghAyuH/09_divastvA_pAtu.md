### Translation
9. From the sky let the yellow one protect thee; from the midst let the  
silver one protect thee; from the earth let that made of iron protect  
\[thee\]; this \[man\] hath gone forward to strongholds of the gods.

### Notes
Ppp. combines at the end *-purā ’yam*. This verse also is called  
*kakummatī* by the Anukr. without any reason.
