### Translation
12. Not on his couch lies a beautiful hundred-bringing (*-vāhī́*) wife,  
in whose kingdom the Brahman's wife is obstructed through ignorance.

### Notes
Literally, 'in what kingdom'; 'obstructed,' i.e. 'kept from him.'  
'Hundred,' i.e., probably, 'a rich dowry' (so the Pet. Lex.). The mss.  
have, as is usual in such cases, *ácityā*.

No lovely wife who brings her dower in hundreds rests upon his bed, Within whose kingdom is detained, through want of sense, a Brahman's dame.
