### Translation
6. The gods of old verily spoke about her, the seven seers who sat down  
with penance (*tápas*); fearful \[is\] the wife of the Brahman when led  
away; she makes (*dhā*) discomfort (*durdhā́*) in the highest firmament  
(*vyòman*).

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Our mss. (except P.M.W., which often agree in a misreading) give  
*ápanītā* (instead of *úp-*) in **c** and this is to be regarded as the  
proper AV. text, and is implied in the translation; our edition reads  
*úpan-*, with RV. RV. differs also in having *tápase*, an easier  
reading, in **b**; and it has no *vāí* in **a**, the intrusion of which  
defaces the meter, though unnoticed by the Anukr. Ppp. has *ajayanta*  
(for *avad-*) in **a**, combines *saptarṣ-* in **b**, and gives  
*brāhmaṇasyā ’pinihitā* in **c**.

Thus spake of her those Gods of old, Seven Rishis, who sate them down to their austere devotion: Dire is a Brahman's wife led home by others: in the supremest heaven she plants confusion.
