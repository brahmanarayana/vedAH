### Translation
1. These spoke first at the offense against the Brahman (*bráhman-*):  
the boundless sea, Mātariśvan, he of stout rage (*-háras*), formidable  
fervor, the kindly one, the heavenly waters, first-born of right  
(*ṛtá*).

### Notes
RV. reads *ugrás* in **c**, and *ṛténa* at the end. Ppp. reads *-haras*  
and *-bhuvas* in **c**, and *apas* in **d**. The first pāda is properly  
*jagatī*, though the Anukr. takes no notice of the fact.
