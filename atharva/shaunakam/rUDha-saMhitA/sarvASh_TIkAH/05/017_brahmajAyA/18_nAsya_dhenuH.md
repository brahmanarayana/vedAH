### Translation
18. Not his \[is\] a beautiful milch-cow, \[his\] draft-ox endures not  
the pole, where a Brahman stays a night miserably (*pāpáyā*) without a  
wife (*-jāni*).

### Notes
Ppp. reads for **a** *na tatra dhenur dohena*. ⌊See BR. vi. 1023.⌋

His milch-cow doth not profit one, his draught-ox masters not the yoke, Wherever, severed from his wife, a Brahman spends the mourn- ful night.
