### Translation
3. To be seized by the hand indeed is the pledge (? *ādhí*) of her, if  
one has said "\[she is\] the Brahman's wife"; she stood not to be sent  
forth for a messenger: so is made safe (*gupitá*) the kingdom of the  
Kshatriya.}}

### Notes
The sense of **a** and **c** is obscure; perhaps we ought to read  
*háste* (or *-tena*) *nāí ’vá* in **a**, 'nothing of hers is to be  
meddled with, when once she is declared the Brahman's.' The mss. vary  
between *grāhyás* (B.), *grā́hyas* (E.), and *grāhyàs* (the rest). RV.  
reads *ávocan* in **b**, and adds *iyám* before *íti*, by omitting which  
our text damages the meter (but the Anukr. does not notice it). RV. also  
has in **c** *prahyè* for *prahéyā;* the two readings are of virtually  
identicjil meaning; emendation to *dūtyā̀ya* is desirable. Ppp. reads  
*ādir* in **a**.

The man, her pledge, must by the hand be taken when he hath cried, She is a Brahman's consort. She stayed not for a herald to conduct her: thus is the kingdom of a ruler guarded.
