### Translation
4. The misfortune, descending (*ava-pad*) upon the village, of which  
they say "this is a star with disheveled hair"—as such, the Brahman's  
wife burns up the kingdom, where hath gone forth a hare (? *śaśá*)  
accompanied with meteors (*ulkuṣī́*-).

### Notes
That is, such apparent portents are really the woman, that has been  
misused. A very awkwardly constructed verse. Ppp. reads in **a**  
*tārakāṁ vik-*, and, in **c**, *tinotu* for *dunoti*. It is, of course,  
the reference to meteoric portents that causes the verse to be quoted in  
Kāuś. 126.
