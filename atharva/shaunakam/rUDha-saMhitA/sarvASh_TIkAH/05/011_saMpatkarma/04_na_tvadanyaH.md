### Translation
4. None else than thou is more poet, nor by wisdom (*medhá*) more wise  
(*dhī́ra*), O Varuṇa, self-ruling one (*svadhā́vant*); thou knowest all  
these beings; even that wily man (*jána*) now is afraid of thee.

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **a** *vedhā anu* (for *medháyā*), and has at end of **b**  
the more antique form *svadhāvas;* as second half-verse it gives: *tvam  
an̄ga viśvā janmāni vettha mataṁ na tuj jano māṁ bibhāyaḥ*.

None, self-dependent Varuna! existeth wiser than thou or sager by his wisdom. Thou knowest well all these created beings: even the man of wondrous powers fears thee.
