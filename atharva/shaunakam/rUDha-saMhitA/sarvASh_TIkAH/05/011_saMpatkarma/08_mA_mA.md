### Translation
8. Let not people call me ungenerous; I give thee back the spotted  
\[cow\], O singer; come thou mightily (*śácībhis*) to every song of  
praise (*stotrá*) of mine, among all human regions (*díś*).

### Notes
Roth's suggested emendation of *dikṣú* at the end to *vikṣú* 'settlers,  
tribes,' accepted by Muir, is unquestionably an improvement of the text;  
Ppp. has unfortunately a different reading: *ā yāhi janeṣu antar deveṣu  
mānuṣeṣu riprā*. *Dikṣu* is read in Prāt. iv. 34 c.

Let not men call me an illiberal giver. I give thee back the brindled cow, O singer. Attend in every place where men inhabit, with all thy powers, the hymn that tells my praises.
