### Translation
2. Not at pleasure am I a re-bestower; for examination (?) do I drive  
home this spotted \[cow\]; by what poesy (*kā́vya*) now, O Atharvan,  
\[art\] thou \[poet\]? by what that is produced (*jātá*) art thou  
*jātávedas?*

### Notes
The rendering of **b** implies the necessary and obvious emendation of  
*sáṁ cakṣe* (P.M.W. *-kṣve*) to *saṁcákṣe*, infinitive. *Kā́mena* seems  
taken adverbially, = *kāmāya, kāmam, kāmāt;* the god is not to be moved  
to counter-liberality by the mere desire of his worshiper, but  
challenges the latter's claim on him. *Jātavedas*, lit. 'having for  
possession whatever is produced (or born),' 'all-possessor.' B.P.M.  
accent *átharvan* in **c**; one might emend to *átharvā:* 'in virtue of  
what poetic merit art thou Atharvan?' The verse belongs of course to  
Varuṇa. Ppp. reads in **b** *saṁpṛcchi* and *upājet*.

Not through desire do I revoke my present: I bring this brind- led cow to contemplate her. Now by what lore, by what inherent nature, knowest thou all things that exist, Atharvan?
