### Translation
7. Since thou verily, O Varuṇa, speakest many reproachful things among  
(as to?) re-bestowers, do not thou, I pray, belong to (*abhi-bhū*) such  
*paṇís;* let not people call thee ungenerous (*arādhás*).

### Notes
The rendering implies emendation of *bhūt* to *bhūs* at end of **c**,  
which is made also by Roth and Muir. The pāda is corrupt in Pāipp.

Many reproaches, Varuna, dost thou utter against the misers. who revoke their presents. Be not thou added to that crowd of niggards: let not men call thee an illiberal giver.
