### Translation
9. Let uplifted (*ud-yam*) songs of praise of thee come, among all human  
regions. Give now to me what thou hast not given me; thou art my  
suitable comrade of seven steps;—

### Notes
That is, apparently, ready to go seven steps (or any indefinite  
distance) with me. Roth suggests as an improved reading *ā́dattas* 'hast  
taken from me' in **c**, and Muir so renders. Both words are alike, and  
equally, wrong grammatically, using the passive pple in the sense of an  
active; *ádattam ásti* would be correct, and at this Ppp. perhaps  
points: *dehi taṁ mahyaṁ yadi tatvam asti yadyo nas saptapadaḥ sakhā  
’saḥ*. Ppp. also begins with *yā te stotrāṇi bandhanāni yāni*, and  
apparently has *dikṣu* in **b**.

Let hymns of praise ascend to thee, uplifted in every place of human habitation. But give me now the gift thou hast not given. Thou art my friend for ever firm and faithful.
