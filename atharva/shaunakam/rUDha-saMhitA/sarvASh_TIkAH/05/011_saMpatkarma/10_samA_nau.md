### Translation
10. Of us two, O Varuṇa, \[there is\] the same connection, the same  
birth (*jā́*).

### Notes
I know that which is of us two this same birth; I give that which I have  
not given thee; I am thy suitable comrade of seven steps;—  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
It seems necessary to divide this verse between the two speakers, and  
doubtless Roth's assignment of only the first pāda to Atharvan is better  
than Muir's of the first half-verse. With Roth's division the *nāu* is  
called for in **a** as in **b**, and Roth's emendation to *samānó  
bándhus*, though it is read by Ppp. (whose testimony on such a point is  
of little value), is hardly acceptable; better *samó nāu*. Ppp. reads  
also, for **b**, *vada vāitad vadaṁ samā jāḥ;* and, for **c**, *dadāmi  
tubhyaṁ yadi tatvam asti;* and it omits **d**. ⌊The translation implies  
*ádattam ásti* as in 9.⌋

One origin, Varuna! one bond unites us I know the nature of that common kinship. I give thee now the gift that I retracted. I am thy friend for ever firm and faithful.
