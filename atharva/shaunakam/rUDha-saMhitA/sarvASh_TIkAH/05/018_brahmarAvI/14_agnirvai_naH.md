### Translation
14. Agni verily our guide. Soma is called \[our\] heir, Indra slayer of  
imprecation (?): so know the devout that.

### Notes
Ppp. reads, for second half-verse, *jayatā ’bhiśasta indras tat satyaṁ  
devasaṁhitam*. Pāda **c** plainly calls for correction (*pada* has  
*abhí॰śastā*); Zimmer proposes *abhíśastam*, the Pet. Lex. ⌊vii. 1515⌋  
*abhíśastim;* *abhíśatyās*, gen., or even *abhiśastipā́s* (cf. vs. 6),  
might be suggested as yet more probable.

Agni, in sooth, is called our guide, Soma is called our next of kin. Indra quells him who curses us. Sages know well that this is so.
