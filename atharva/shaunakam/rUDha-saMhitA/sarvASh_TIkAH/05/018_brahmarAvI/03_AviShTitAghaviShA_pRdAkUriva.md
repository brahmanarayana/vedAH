### Translation
3. Like an ill-poisonous adder enveloped with \[cow-\] hide, this cow of  
the Brahman, O noble, is harsh, not to be eaten.

### Notes
That is (**a, b**) a poisonous serpent in disguise. At beginning of  
**c**, *mā́* in our text is an error for *sā́*.

The Brahman's cow is like a snake, charged with due poison, clothed with skin. Rajanya! bitter to the taste is she, and none may eat of her.
