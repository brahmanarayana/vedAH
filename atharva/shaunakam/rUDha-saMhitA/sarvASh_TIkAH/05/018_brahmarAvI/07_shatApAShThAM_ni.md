### Translation
7. He swallows down what (f.) has a hundred barbs; he is not able to  
tear it out—the fool who thinks of the food of Brahmans "I am eating  
what is sweet."

### Notes
The verse is wanting in Ppp. (as noticed above). The mss. read  
*niḥkhídan* at end of **b**; our edition has made the necessary  
emendation to *-dam*. The cow, of course, is meant in **a, b**. Many  
mss. (B.M.E.I.H.D.K.) accent *malvàḥ* in **c**.
