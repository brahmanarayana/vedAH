### Translation
11. The cow herself, being slain, pulled down those Vāitahavyas, who  
cooked the last she-goat of Kesaraprābandhā (?).

### Notes
The second half-verse is totally defaced in Ppp. The *pada*-text reads  
in **d** *carama॰ájām;* the accent is anomalous, and the sense  
unacceptable; Ludwig's translation, "letztgeboren," implying emendation  
to *carama-jā́m*, suggests a welcome improvement of the text.  
*Késara॰prābandhāyās* has its long *ā* of *-prā-* in *pada*-text noted  
in Prāt. iv. 96. Ppp. reads *ivā ’carat* in **b**.
