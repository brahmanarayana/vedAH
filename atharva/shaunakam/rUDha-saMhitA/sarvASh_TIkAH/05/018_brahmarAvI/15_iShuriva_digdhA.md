### Translation
15. Like an arrow smeared \[with poison\], O lord of men, like an adder,  
O lord of cattle—that arrow of the Brahman is terrible; with it he  
pierces the insulting.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *digdhā* instead of *ghorā* in **c**. The Anukr. does not  
call the verse *bhurij*, although the full pronunciation of the *iva* in  
**a** would make it so. In the first half-verse doubtless the two lower  
castes are addressed.

Prince! like a poisoned arrow, like a deadly snake, O lord of kine! Dire is the Brahman's arrow: he pierces his enemies therewith.
