### Translation
4. Verily it conducts away his authority, smites his splendor; like fire  
taken hold of it burns up all; he who thinks the Brahman to be food, he  
drinks of Timātan poison.

### Notes
Or 'she' (the cow), or 'he' (the Brahman), instead of 'it,' in **a, b**.  
Ppp. reads in **b** *ālabdhaḥ pṛtannota rāṣṭaṁ*, and has a wholly  
different second half-verse, nearly agreeing with our 13 **c, d**: *yo  
brāhmaṇaṁ devabandhuṁ hinasti tasya pitṝṇām apy etu* *lokam*. The  
Anukr. reckons the verse unnecessarily as *bhurij*, since *iva* in **b**  
is to be shortened to *’va*.

She takes away his strength, she mars his splendour, she ruins everything like fire enkindled. That man drinks poison of the deadly serpent who counts the Brahman as mere food to feed him.
