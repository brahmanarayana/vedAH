### Translation
9. The Brahmans have sharp arrows, have missiles; what volley  
(*śaravyā̀*) they hurl, it is not in vain; pursuing (*anu-hā*) with  
fervor and with fury, they split him down even from afar.

### Notes
Ppp. bas *te tayā* at the end, instead of *enam*. ⌊Pāda **b** is of  
course *jagatī*.⌋

Keen arrows have the Brahmans, armed with missiles: the shaft, when they discharge it, never faileth. Pursuing him with fiery zeal and anger, they pierce the foeman even from a distance.
