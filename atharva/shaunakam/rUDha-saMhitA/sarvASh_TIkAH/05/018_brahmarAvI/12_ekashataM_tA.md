### Translation
12. Those hundred and one fellows (? *janátā*) whom the earth shook off,  
having injured the progeny of the Brahmans, perished irretrievably.

### Notes
Bp. accents properly *vi॰ádhūnuta* in **b**, but all the saṁhitā mss.  
give *vyàdh-*, and D. has correspondingly *ví॰adh-*: cf. 19. 11 . Ppp.  
reads *vāi* for *tās* in **a**, and *bhūmir yā* in **b**.

One and a hundred were the folk, those whom the earth shook off from her: When they had wronged the Brahman race they perished incon- ceivably.
