### Translation
9. Fallen from the horse's mouth, she invaded the trees; having become a  
winged brook (? *sarā́*), do thou come to us, O *arundhatī́*.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
BR. ⌊iv. 40J⌋ take **a** to mean 'coagulated from the horse's blood,'  
understanding *asnás*, with the *pada*-text. With **c** compare RV. x.  
97. 9 (VS. xii. 83) *strā́ḥ patatríṇīḥ sihana* (TS. iv. 2. 6² and MS. ii.  
7. 13 read *sarā́ḥ* instead). The word *siṣyade* (p. *sisyade*) comes  
under Prāt. ii. 91, 103; iv. 82, 124. In the printed text, *sápatitā* is  
a misprint for *sámp-*. ⌊Ppp. has for **b** *sā parṇam abhiśuṣyataḥ* and  
combines *ne ’hi* in **d**.⌋  
  
The first *anuvāka*, 5 hymns and 48 verses, ends here. The quoted Anukr.  
says *dviṣaḍbhir ādyaḥ* (i.e. twice six short of 60 verses).

Issuing from the horse's blood away she glided to the trees. Become a winged water-brook, and come to us, Arundhati!
