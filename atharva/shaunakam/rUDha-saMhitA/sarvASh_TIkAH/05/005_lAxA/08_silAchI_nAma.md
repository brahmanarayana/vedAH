### Translation
8. *Silācī́* by name—thy father, O goat-brown one, is a maid's son;  
Yama's horse that is dark brown (*śyāvá*)—with its mouth (? blood?) art  
thou sprinkled.

### Notes
The first line is translated in accordance with the text as it stands;  
Grill emends to *kānīnā́ ’jábabhruḥ* ⌊accent, *Gram.* §1268: *ájababhru*  
could only be vocative⌋. The *pada*-text reads *āsnā́* in **d** ⌊SPP.  
*asnā́*⌋, but *asnáḥ* in 9 **a**; the translation implies *ās-* in both;  
Grill understands *as-* both times. Ppp. has for **a, b** *ghṛtācī nāma  
kānīno ’ta babhrū pitā tava*.

Silachi is thy name: thy sire, O goat-brown! is a damsel's son. Thou hast been sprinkled by the mouth of Yama's tawny- coloured horse.
