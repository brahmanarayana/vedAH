### Translation
1. What \[witchcraft\] they have made for thee in a raw vessel, what  
they have made in one of mixed grains; in raw flesh what witchcraft they  
have made—I take that back again.

### Notes
That is, doubtless, 'back to its maker': cf. iv. 18. 4; and, for the  
whole verse, iv. 17. 4. The Anukr. makes no account of the redundant  
syllable in **c**.

The spell that they have cast for thee on unbaked dish or ming- led meal, The witchcraft wrought on undressed meat, this I strike back again on them.
