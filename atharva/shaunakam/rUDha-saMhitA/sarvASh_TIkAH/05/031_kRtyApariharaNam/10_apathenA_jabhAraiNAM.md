### Translation
10. He hath brought it by what was not the road; we send it forth from  
here by the road; he unwise, O men, hath brought \[it\] together, out of  
thoughtlessness, for the wise (*dhī́ra*).

### Notes
The translation implies the reading *maryāḥ; dhī́rebhyaḥ:* in **c**,  
instead of *maryā॰dhī́rebhyaḥ*, as given by the *pada*-mss.; the  
emendation is suggested by BR. v. 1668; but cf. *maryādhāírya*  
(*maryā*\[*ḥ*\] *dhāírya?*) in MS. i. 4. 8 (p. 56, 1. 18). The lingual  
*ṇ* in *eṇām* at end of **a** is given by all the *saṁhitā*-mss., though  
the Prāt. does not prescribe it. Even the *pada*-text has *hiṇmasi* (as  
hiṇmaḥ*) after* pra*, here as elsewhere.*

He brought this by no proper path, by the right path we drive it back. The fool in folly brought it to those who observe established bounds.
