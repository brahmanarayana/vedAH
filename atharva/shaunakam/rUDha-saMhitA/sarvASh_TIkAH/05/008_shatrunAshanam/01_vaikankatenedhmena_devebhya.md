### Translation
1. With fuel of *víkan̄kata* do thou carry the sacrificial butter to the  
gods; O Agni, make them revel here; let all come to my call.

### Notes
The *víkan̄kata* is identified as *Flacourtia sapida*, a thorny plant.  
Ppp. reads *sādaya*, which is better, in **c**, and combines *sarvā  
”yantu* in **d**.
