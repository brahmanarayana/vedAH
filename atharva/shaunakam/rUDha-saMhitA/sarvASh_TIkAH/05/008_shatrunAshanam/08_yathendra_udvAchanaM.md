### Translation
8. As Indra, taking Udvācana, put \[him\] underneath his feet, so do I  
put down them yonder, through everlasting (*śáśvat*) years (*sámā*).

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
*Udvā́cana* is heard of nowhere else, and the name looks so improbable  
that the Pet. Lexx. conjecture *udváñcana;* Ppp. has instead *udvātana;*  
it puts this verse at the end of the hymn. The redundancy of **d** is  
passed without notice by the Anukr.

As Indra, having seized him, set his foot upon Udvachana, Even so for all the coming years I cast those men beneath my feet.
