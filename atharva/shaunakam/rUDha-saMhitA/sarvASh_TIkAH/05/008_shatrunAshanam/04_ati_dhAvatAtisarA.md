### Translation
4. Overrun (*ati-dhāv*), ye over-runners; slay by Indra's spell  
(*vácas*); shake (*math*) ye as a wolf \[shakes\] a sheep; let him not  
be released from you alive; shut up his breath.

### Notes
The end of the verse is different, but without sense, in Ppp. An  
accent-mark has dropped out under the *ta* of *mathnīta* in our text  
⌊and under *hata* there is one which should be deleted⌋. The Anukr.  
apparently forbids us to make the familiar contraction *vṛke ’va* in  
**c**, and then overlooks the deficiency of a syllable in **d**. ⌊Cf.  
Bergaigne, *Rel. véd.* iii. 7-8.⌋

Run, ye Fxertions, farther on By Indra's order smite and slay. As a wolf worrieth a sheep, so let not him escape from you while life remains. Stop fast his breath.
