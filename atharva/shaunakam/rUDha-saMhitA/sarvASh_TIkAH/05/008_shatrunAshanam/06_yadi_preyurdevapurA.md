### Translation
6. If they have gone forward to the gods' strongholds (*-purā*), have  
made incantation (*bráhman*) their defenses—if (? *yát*) making a  
body-protection, a complete protection, they have encouraged themselves  
(*upa-vac*): all that do thou make sapless.

### Notes
The verse is found again below, as xi. 10. 17,\* but without commentary.  
*Bráhman* may have here one of its higher senses; possibly *upa-vac* is  
to be understood as = *upa-vad* 'reproach, impute.' For *kṛṇvānā́ yád  
upociré*, Ppp. reads simply *cakrire*, with *paripāṇāni* before it. The  
verse is plainly a *pathyāpan̄kti*, but the *pada*-mss. support the  
misconception of the Anukr. by putting the pāda-division after  
*kṛṇvānā́s*. The Anukr. ought to say *āstārapan̄kti*, but it not very  
rarely makes this confusion. \*⌊Vol. iii. p. 195, of SPP's ed.⌋
