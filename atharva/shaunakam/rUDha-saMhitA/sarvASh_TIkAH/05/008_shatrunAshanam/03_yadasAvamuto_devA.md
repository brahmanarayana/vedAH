### Translation
3. What he there yonder, O gods, being godless, desires to do—let not  
Agni carry his oblation; let not the gods go to his call; come ye only  
(*evá*) unto my call.

### Notes
Some of the mss. (Bp².p.m.Bp.I.D.) read *cíkīriṣati* in **b**. We may  
make the contraction *devā ’sya* in **d**, though the Anukr. does not  
sanction it.

Whatever plot from yonder, O ye Gods, that godless man would frame, Let not the Gods come to his call, nor Agni bear his offering up. Come, ye, come hither to my call.
