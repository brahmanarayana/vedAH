### Translation
7. If either thou art god-made, or if made by man, thee, being such, do  
we lead back, with Indra as ally.

### Notes
Ppp. has a very different version of this verse: *yā kṛtye devakṛtā yā  
vā manuṣyajā ’si: tāṁ tvā pratyan̄ prahiṇmasi pratīcī nayana brahmaṇā*.  
The *ṇ* in *púnar ṇayāmasi* is prescribed by Prāt. iii. 81. *Táṁ* at  
beginning of **c** is a misprint for *tā́ṁ*.

Now whether thou hast been prepared by Gods or been pre- pared by men, We, with our Indra at our side to aid us, lead thee back again.
