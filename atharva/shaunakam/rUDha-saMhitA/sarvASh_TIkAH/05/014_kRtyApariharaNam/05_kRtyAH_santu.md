### Translation
5. Be the witchcrafts for the witchcraft-maker, the curse for him that  
curses; like an easy chariot let the witchcraft roll back to the  
witchcraft-maker.

Back on the wizard fall his craft, upon the curser light his curse! Let witchcraft, like a well-naved car, roll back upon the sorcerer.
