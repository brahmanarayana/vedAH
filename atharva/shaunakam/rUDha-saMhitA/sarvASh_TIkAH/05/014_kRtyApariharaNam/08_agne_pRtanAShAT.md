### Translation
8. O Agni, overpowerer of fighters, overpower the fighters; we take the  
witchcraft back to the witchcraft-maker by a returner.

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **b** *prati* instead of *punar*, thus making a better  
correspondence with *pratiharaṇa* in **c**. The Anukr's definition of  
the "verse" is purely artificial; the first pāda is distinctly  
unmetrical, and the third hardly metrical.

Agni, victorious in fight, subdue the armies of our foes! Back on the sorcerer we cast his sorcery, and beat it home.
