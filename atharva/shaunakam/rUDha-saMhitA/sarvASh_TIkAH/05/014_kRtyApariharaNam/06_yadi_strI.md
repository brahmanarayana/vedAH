### Translation
6. If woman, or if man, hath made witchcraft in order to evil, it we  
conduct unto him, like a horse by a horse-halter.

### Notes
The Anukr. doubtless scans **d** as *áśvam ivā ’śvābhidhā́nyā*, instead  
of *áśvam ’va ’śvābhidhā́niā*, as it should be.

Whoso, for other's harm hath dealt-woman or man-in magic arts, To him we lead the sorcery back, even as a courser with a rope.
