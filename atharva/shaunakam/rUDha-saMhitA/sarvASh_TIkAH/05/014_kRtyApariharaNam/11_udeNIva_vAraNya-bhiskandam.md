### Translation
11. Up, like a she-antelope (*eṇī́*), a she-elephant (? *vāraṇī́*), with  
leaping on, like a hind, let the witchcraft go to its maker.

### Notes
  
  
  
A verse of doubtful interpretation; but it is altogether probable that  
the animal-names are coördinate in construction with  
  
  
*kṛtyā́*  
  
  
in  
  
  
**c**  
  
  
; and they are feminine doubtless because this is feminine; the  
  
  
*kṛtyā*  
  
  
is to overtake its perpetrator with their swiftness and force. But the  
Pet. Lex. takes  
  
  
*vāraṇī́*  
  
  
as 'shy, wild,' qualifying  
  
  
*eṇī́*  
  
  
. Ppp. combines  
  
  
*enāi ’va*  
  
  
and  
  
  
*mṛgāi ’va*  
  
  
, and reads  
  
  
*vāruṇī*  
  
  
, and  
  
  
*-krandaṁ*  
  
  
for  
  
  
*-skandaṁ;*  
  
  
  
  
  
*-krandam*  
  
  
seems rather preferable. The unaltered  
  
  
*s*  
  
  
of  
  
  
*abhisk-*  
  
  
in  
  
  
**b**  
  
  
falls under Prāt. ii. 104, and the example is quoted there. Though the  
verse is a fairly regular  
  
  
*gāyatrī*  
  
  
, the Anukr. stupidly accounts it a  
  
  
*sāmnī triṣṭubh*  
  
  
, as if it were prose, and contained only 22 syllables.

Even as the timid antelope or hind from her assailant flees, So swiftly let the sorcery o'ertake and reach the sorcerer.
