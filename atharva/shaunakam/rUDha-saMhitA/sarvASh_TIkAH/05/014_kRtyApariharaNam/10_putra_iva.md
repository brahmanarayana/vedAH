### Translation
10. Go as a son to a father; like a constrictor trampled on, bite; go, O  
witchcraft, back to the witchcraft-maker, as it were treading down  
\[thy\] bond.

### Notes
That is, apparently, escaping and treading on what has restrained thee.  
Ppp. combines in **b** *svajāiva*, and reads for **c, d**, *tantur  
ivāvyayaṁnide kṛtye kṛtyākṛtaṁ kṛtāḥ*. Though the verse is a perfectly  
good *anuṣṭubh*, the Anukr., reading *iva* three times as dissyllabic,  
turns it into a defective *bṛhatī*.

Go as a son goes to his sire: bite as a trampled viper bites. As one who flies from bonds, go back, O Witchcraft, to the sorcerer.
