### Translation
2. The people who delivered up (? *arpay-*) the Brahman Brihatsāman,  
descendant of An̄giras—a he-goat with two rows of teeth, a sheep,  
consumed (*av*) their offspring (*toká*).

### Notes
The translation implies emendation in **c** to *ubhayā́dann* (nom. of  
*-dant*), as suggested in the *Index Verborum*, and, indeed, assumed  
also by Zimmer and Muir. Ppp. is so mutilated that nothing is to be  
learned from it. The definition of the verse given by the Anukr.  
corresponds with its present form; but **a** invites emendation.

When men pierced Brihatsaman through, the Brahman, son of Angiras, The ram with teeth in both his jaws, the sheep, devoured their progeny.
