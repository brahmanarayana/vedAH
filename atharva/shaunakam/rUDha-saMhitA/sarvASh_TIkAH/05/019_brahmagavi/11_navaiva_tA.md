### Translation
11. Those same nine nineties whom the earth shook off, having injured  
the progeny of the Brahman, perished irretrievably.

### Notes
This verse is nearly the same with 18. 12 above; and the various  
accentuations of *vyádhūnuta* are precisely the same here as there.

Those nine-and-ninety people whom Earth shook and cast away from her, When they had wronged the Brahman race were ruined incon- ceivably.
