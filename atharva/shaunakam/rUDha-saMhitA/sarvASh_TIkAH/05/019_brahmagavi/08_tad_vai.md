### Translation
8. It leaks verily into that kingdom, as water into a split boat  
(*nāú*); where they injure a Brahman, that kingdom misfortune smites.

### Notes
Ppp. puts *bhinnām* before *nāvam* in **b**, and has for **c** *brāhmaṇo  
yatra jīyate* (like our 6 **d**). Zimmer and Muir prefer to understand  
in **a** a subject, coördinate with *udakam* in **b**: "ruin flows into  
that kingdom." ⌊W. doubtless means to imply that it is not competent to  
base upon the phrase in **b** an argument about shipwreck and ocean  
commerce. But cf. Hopkins, AJP. xix. 139.⌋

As water swamps a leaky ship so ruin overflows that realm. Misfortune smites the realm wherein a Brahman suffers scath and harm.
