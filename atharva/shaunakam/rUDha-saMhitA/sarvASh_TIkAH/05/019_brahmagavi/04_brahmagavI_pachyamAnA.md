### Translation
4. The Brahman's cow, being cooked, as far as she penetrates (?), smites  
out the brightness (*téjas*) of a kingdom; no virile (*vṛ́ṣan*) hero is  
born \[there\].

### Notes
*Ján̄gahe* is doubtful in meaning, although it cannot well be referred to  
any root but *gāh;* derivation from a root *jaṅh*, proposed in the major  
Pet. Lex., is apparently withdrawn in the minor. Ppp. reads *pumān* in  
**d**. The separate accent of *abhí* in **b** is a case falling under  
Prāt. iv. 4, and the passage is quoted in the commentary to that rule.

While yet the Brahman's cow which men are dressing quivers in her throe: She mars the kingdom's splendour: there no vigorous hero springs to life.
