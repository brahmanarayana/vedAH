### Translation
15. The rain of Mitra-and- Varuna does not rain upon the

wins (*nī*) no friend to his control.

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **b** *-jyām*. With **c** compare vi. 88. 3 **d**.

The rain of Mitra-Varuna falls not on him who wrongs the priest. To him no counsel brings success: he wins, no friend to do his will.
