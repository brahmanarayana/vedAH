### Translation
5. Cruel is the cutting up of her; harsh to eat (?) is her prepared  
flesh (*piśitám*); in that the milk (*kṣīrá*) of her is drunk, that  
verily is an offense against the Fathers.

### Notes
The translation implies emendation of *asyate* in **b** to *asyate*, as  
suggested by Zimmer; Ppp. unfortunately lacks the verse.

Terrible is her cutting-up: her bitter flesh is cast away, And it is counted sin among the Fathers if her milk is drunk.
