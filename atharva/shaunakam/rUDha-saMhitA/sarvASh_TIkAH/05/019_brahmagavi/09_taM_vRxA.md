### Translation
9. Him the trees drive away, saying "do not come unto our shadow," who,  
O Nārada, plots against that which is the riches of the Brahman.

### Notes
Or, 'against the real (*sát*) riches' etc.; emendation of *sát* to *tát*  
(BR. v. 515) seems uncalled for. The verse reads as if taken from a  
collection of adages.

The very trees repel the man, and drive him from their sheltering shade, Whoever claims, O Narada, the treasure that a Brahman owns.
