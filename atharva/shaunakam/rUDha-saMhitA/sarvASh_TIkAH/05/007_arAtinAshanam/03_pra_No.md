### Translation
3. Let our god-made winning progress (*pra-kḷp*) by day and by night; we  
go forth after the niggard; homage be to the niggard.

### Notes
Bp.² reads *vas* for *nas* in **a**; in **c** Bp.²P.M.K. read *arātím*,  
and H.E.I. *árātim;* our text should doubtless have adopted *árātim.*  
The third pāda is redundant by a syllable.

May our desire which Gods have roused fulfil itself by day and night. We seek to win Arati: to Arati be our homage paid.
