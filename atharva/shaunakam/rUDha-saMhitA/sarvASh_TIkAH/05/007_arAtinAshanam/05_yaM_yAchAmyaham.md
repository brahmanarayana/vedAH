### Translation
5. Whomever I solicit (*yāc*) with speech, with Sarasvatī, mind-yoked,  
him may faith find today, given by the brown soma.

### Notes
'Faith given,' i.e. 'confidence awakened.' With **b** compare 10.8,  
below. ⌊See Bloomfield, AJP. xvii. 412; Oldenberg, ZDMG. l. 448.⌋

The portion that I crave with speech intelligent and full of power, May faith, presented with the gift of tawny Soma, find to-day.
