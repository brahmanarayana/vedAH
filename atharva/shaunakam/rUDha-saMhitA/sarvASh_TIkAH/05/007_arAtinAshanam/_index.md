### Comment
Not found in Pāipp. Used by Kāuś. in the nirṛtikarman (18. 14), with an offering of rice-grains; and, with iii. 20 and vii. 1, in a rite for good-fortune (41. 8); while the schol. also adds it to vi. 7 (46. 4, note), in removing obstacles to sacrifice; of separate verses, vs. 5 (schol., vss. 5-10) appears, with vii. 57, in a ceremony (46. 6) for the success of requests. Vāit. has the hymn (or vs. 1) in the agnicayana (28. 19), with the vanivāhana rite; further, vs. 6 in the parvan sacrifices (3. 2), with an oblation to Indra and Agni; and vs. 7 at the agniṣṭoma (12. 10) in expiation of a forbidden utterance. The hymn in general seems to be a euphemistic offering of reverence to the spirit of avarice or stinginess.
