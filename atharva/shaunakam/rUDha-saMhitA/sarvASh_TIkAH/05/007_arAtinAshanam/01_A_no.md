### Translation
1. Bring to us, stand not about, O niggard; do not prevent (? *rakṣ*)  
our sacrificial gift as led \[away\]; homage be to baffling (*vīrtsā́*),  
to ill-success; homage be to the niggard.

### Notes
P.M.W. omit *mā́* in **a**. One sees, without approving, the ground of  
the metrical definition of the Anukr.

Bring thou to us, bar not the way, Arati! Stay not the guerdon that is being brought us. Homage be paid to Failure, to Misfortune, and Malignity.
