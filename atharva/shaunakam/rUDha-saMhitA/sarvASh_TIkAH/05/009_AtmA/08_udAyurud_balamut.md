### Translation
8. Up life-time, up strength, up act (*kṛtá*), up action (*kṛtyā́*), up  
skill (*manīṣā́*), up sense (*indriyá*); O life- (*ā́yus-*) maker, O ye  
(two) mistresses of life, rich in *svadhā́*⌊*m*.⌋, be ye my guardians,  
guard me; be my soulsitters; do not harm me.

### Notes
The nouns with 'up' are accusatives, but what verb should be supplied  
for the construction it is not easy to see. Perhaps *ā́yuṣkṛt* (p.  
*ā́yuḥ-kṛt*) should be *-kṛtā*, as dual; at any rate, all that follows it  
is dual. Apparently the Anukr. would divide vs. 7 as 9 + 12: 10 + 7 + 10  
= 48; and vs. 8 as 9 + 11: 20: 11 = 51; but the descriptions are blind  
and inaccurate. ⌊Weber discusses the peculiarities of gender.⌋  
  
A passage corresponding to this hymn is found in K. xxxvii. 15.

Exalt my life, my strength, my deed and action; increase my understanding and my vigour. Be ye my powerful keepers, watch and guard me, ye mistresses of life and life's creators! Dwell ye within me, and forbear to harm me.
