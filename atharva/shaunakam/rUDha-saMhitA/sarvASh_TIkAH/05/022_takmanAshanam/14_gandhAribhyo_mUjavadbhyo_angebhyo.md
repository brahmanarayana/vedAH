### Translation
14. To the Gandhāris, the Mūjavants, the An̄gas, the Magadhas, like one  
sending a person a treasure, do we commit the fever.

### Notes
The translation implies in **c** the easy emendation to *préṣyan*  
(*pra-íṣyan*); the accent and *pada*-reading (*pra॰eṣyán*) view the word  
as future from *pra-i;* the translators assume *-ṣyám*, and reach no  
acceptable sense. The comm. to Prāt. ii. 11 correctly quotes the case as  
one of the assimilation of final *n* to initial *j*. The Anukr. this  
time takes no notice of the extra syllable in **c** if we should read  
*iva* instead of *’va*. Ppp. reads *gāndhāribhyo māujamadbhyaṣ kāśibhyo  
mayebhyaḥ: jāne priyam iva śev-*. ⌊As to the proper names, cf. JRAS.  
1890, p. 477.⌋
