### Translation
2. Thou here that makest all \[men\] yellow, heating (*śuc*) up like  
fire, consuming; now then, O fever—for mayest thou become sapless—now go  
away inward or downward.

### Notes
Or *nyàn̄* 'inward' is another 'downward.' The mss. mostly omit to double  
the *n̄* of *nyàn̄*, and several (P.M.W.H.) read *nyàn̄g;* P.M.W. have  
*adharā́g*. Ppp. has our vi. 20. 3 instead of this verse.

And thou thyself who makest all men yellow, consuming them with burning heat like Agni, Thou, Fever! then be weak and ineffective. Pass hence into the realms below or vanish.
