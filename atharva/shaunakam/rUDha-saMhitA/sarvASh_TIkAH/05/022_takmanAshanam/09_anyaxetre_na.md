### Translation
9. In another's field thou restest (*ram*) not; being in control, mayest  
thou be gracious to us; the fever hath become ready (?); it will go to  
the Balhikas.

### Notes
The *pada*-reading in **c** is *pra॰árthaḥ;* *prá-ar-* would better suit  
the meaning given, 'ready to set out,' lit. 'having an object in front'  
(comm. to PB. xi. 1. 6, *prakarṣeṇa iyarti gacchati ’ti prārtho  
‘naḍvān!*). Pāda **b** is identical with vi. 26. 1 **b**; Ppp. has  
instead *sahasrākṣo ‘martyaḥ;* in **d** it reads *bahlikaṁ*.

In a strange land thou joyest not; subdued, thou wilt be kind to us. Fever is eager to depart, and to the Bahlikas will go,
