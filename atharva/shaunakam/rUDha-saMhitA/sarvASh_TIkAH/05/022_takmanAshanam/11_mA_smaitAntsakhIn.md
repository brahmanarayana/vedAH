### Translation
11. Do not thou make them thy companions—the *balā́sa*, the cough, the  
*udyugá* (?); come not back hitherward from there: for that, O fever, I  
appeal to thee.

### Notes
Zimmer (who translates vss. 10-12, at pp. 381-5) understands *udyugá* in  
**b** as 'sich anschliessend'; Ludwig as 'angestrengt,' qualifying  
*kāsám* as adjective; perhaps it means 'hiccough'; *balāsa* may be  
'expectoration.' In **c** the *pada*-text has **ā́**: *āíḥ* (Bp. *ā́:  
éḥ*), accent on the verb-form being false. ⌊SPP's mss. have *ā́* with  
*āíḥ, āiḥ, éḥ*, and *eḥ*.⌋

Take none of these to be thy friends, Cough, or Consumption or Decline: Never come thence again to us! O Fever, thus I counsel thee.
