### Translation
8. Going away, eat thou thy connection (*bándhu*), the Mahāvrishas  
\[and\] Mūjavants; those \[fields\] we announce to the fever; others'  
fields verily \[are\] these.

### Notes
'Thy connection,' i.e. 'those with whom thou hast a right to meddle';  
'fields,' i.e. 'territories': **d**, "these territories here belong to  
some one else." Pāda **b** is corrupt in Ppp.; for **d**, it reads  
*‘nyakṣetrāṇi vāyasām*, and it has further on this verse: *nārkavindāṁ  
nārvidālāṁ nādīyaṁ rvatukāvatīṁ: prajā ni takinane brūmo ‘nyakṣetrāṇi vā  
yumāṁ*. At Ppp. v. 5. 1, 2 we find: *takmann imaṁ te kṣetrabhāgam  
apābhajaṁ pṛthivyāḥ pūrve ardhe*.

Go hence and eat thy kinsmen the Mahavrishas and Mujavans. These or those foreign regions we proclaim to Fever for his home.
