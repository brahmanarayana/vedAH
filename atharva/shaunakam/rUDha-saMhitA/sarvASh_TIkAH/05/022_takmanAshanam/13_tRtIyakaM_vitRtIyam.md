### Translation
13. The fever of the third day, of two days out of three, the constant,  
and the autumnal, the cold, the hot, that of the hot season, that of the  
rainy season, do thou cause to disappear.

### Notes
In **a** the intermittent phases of the disease, of course, are referred  
to. The *pada-*text divides *sadam॰dím* in **b**, perhaps lit.  
'ever-binding.' Pāda **c** lacks a syllable; the Anukr. takes no notice  
of it; we might add *ca* at the end. Ppp. has in **b** *hāyanaṁ* instead  
of *śāradam;* and in **c** *viśvaśāradam* instead of *śītaṁ rūram*.
