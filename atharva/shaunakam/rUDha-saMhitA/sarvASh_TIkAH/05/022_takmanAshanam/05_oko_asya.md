### Translation
5. Its home (*ókas*) is the Mūjavants, its home is the Mahāvrishas; as  
long as born, O fever, so long art thou at home among the Balhikas.

### Notes
The Prāt. rule i. 46 applies, if we may trust the comment, to the name  
in **d**, and proves it to be *bálhika*, and not *báhlika* ⌊cf. Weber,  
as cited above⌋; the mss. vary between the two, the majority giving  
*-lh-*; but the testimony of no ms. is of any authority on this  
particular point; Ppp. appears to have *-hl-*. Some of our mss.  
(I.H.O.D.) accent *tákman* in **c**\*; its omission would rectify the  
meter of **c**; the Anukr. gives a correct (mechanical) definition of  
the verse as it stands. We should expect either *yā́vān* or *tā́vat*.  
\*⌊So do 11 of SPP's.⌋

His mansions are the Mujavans, and the Mahavrishas his home, Thou, Fever, ever since thy birth hast lived among the Bahlikas.
