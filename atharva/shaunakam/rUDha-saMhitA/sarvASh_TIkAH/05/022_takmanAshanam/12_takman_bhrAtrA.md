### Translation
12. O fever, together with thy brother the *balā́sa* \[and\] thy sister  
the cough, together with thy cousin the scab (*pāmán*), go to yon  
foreign people.

### Notes
Ppp. begins with this verse a new hymn, and has, for **c, d**, *apāṁ  
bhrātrātṛvyena naśye ’to marayaṁm abhi*. Read in our text at end of  
**b** *sahá* (an accent-sign slipped out of place). ⌊Without note of  
variants, SPP. gets *papmā́* in both texts instead of our *pāmnā́*, and  
our H. reads *pāpmánā́*. In spite of the possibility of taking *pāpmā́* as  
instrumental (cf. *drāghmā́*, *raśmā́*, JAOS. x. 533), we must deem  
*pāmnā́* the true reading and *pāpmā́* a blunder, due perhaps to the  
frequent collocation *pāpmán bhrā́tṛvya*, AB. etc.⌋

Go, Fever, with Consumption, thy brother, and with thy sister, Cough. And with thy nephew Herpes, go away unto that alien folk.
