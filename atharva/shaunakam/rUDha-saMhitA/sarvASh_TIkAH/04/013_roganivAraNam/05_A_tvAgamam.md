### Translation
5. I have come unto thee with wealfulnesses, likewise with  
uninjurednesses; I have brought for thee formidable dexterity; I drive  
(*sū*) away for thee the *yákṣma*.

### Notes
The RV. text has in **c** *te bhadrám ā́ ’bhārṣam;* both editions give  
the false form *ā́ ’bhāriṣam*, because this time all the mss. (except our  
E.p.m.) chance to read it; in such cases they are usually divided  
between the two forms, and we need not have scrupled to emend here; the  
comm. has *-rṣam*. Ppp. reads in **c** *te bhadram āriṣaṁ*, and, for  
**d**, *parā suvāmy ānuyat*.
