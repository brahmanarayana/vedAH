### Translation
3. Hither, O wind, blow healing; away, O wind, blow what complaint  
\[there is\]; for thou, all-healing one, goest \[as\] messenger of the  
gods.

### Notes
TB.TA. (as above) put this verse before the one that precedes it here  
and in RV. All the three read in **c** *viśvábheṣajas*, and Ppp. intends  
to agree with them (*-bhejajo de-*). The comm. offers an alternative  
explanation of *devānām* in which it is understood as = *indriyāṇām*  
'the senses.' ⌊Von Schroeder gives **a, b**, *Tübinger Kaṭha-hss.*, p.  
115.⌋
