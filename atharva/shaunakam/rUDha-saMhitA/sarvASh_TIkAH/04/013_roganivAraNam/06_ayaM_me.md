### Translation
6. This is my fortunate hand, this my more fortunate one, this my  
all-healing one; this is of propitious touch.

### Notes
This is, without variant, RV. x. 60. 12; it takes in our hymn the place  
of RV. x. 137. 6.

Felicitous is this my hand, yet more felicitous is this. This hand contains all healing balms, and this makes whole with gentle touch.
