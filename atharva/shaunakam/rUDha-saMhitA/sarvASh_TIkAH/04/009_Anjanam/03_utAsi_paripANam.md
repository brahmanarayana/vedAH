### Translation
3. Both art thou a protection, grinder-up of familiar demons (*yātú*), O  
ointment, and of what is immortal thou knowest; likewise art thou  
gratification (*-bhójana*) of the living, likewise remedy of jaundice  
(*hárita-*).

### Notes
Contrary to rule, the *a* of *asi* in **d** has to be elided after  
*átho* in **d**; probably emendation to *áthā ’si* is called for; one of  
our mss. (O.) reads *átho ‘si.* Ppp. rectifies the meter of **a** by  
giving *ute ’vā ’si;* for **c, d** it has *utā ’mṛtatvesye ”śiṣa utā  
’saṣ pitṛbhojanam.* The comm. takes *amṛtasya* as the drink of  
immortality, and *-bhojana* as either *aniṣṭanivartanena pālaka* or  
*bhogasādhana*. The last pāda hardly belongs with the rest.

Thou, also, Salve! art a defence that rends and crushes sorcerers. Thou knowest, too, of Amrit, thou art the delight of all who live, a jaundice-curing balm art thou.
