### Translation
6. From wrong spell, from evil dreaming, from evil deed, from pollution  
also, from the terrible eye of an enemy—therefrom protect us, ointment.

### Notes
Ppp. has, for **b**, *kṣetriyāc chapathād uta*. The Pet. Lexx.  
understand *asanmantrá* as simply "untrue speech" (so Grill,  
"Lügenrede"); the comm. reads instead *-ntryāt*, as adjective qualifying  
*duṣvapnyāt*, and signifying "produced by base bewitching spells."  
*Durhā́rdas* in **c** might well be adj., 'hostile' (so comm.).
