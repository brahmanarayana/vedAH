### Translation
5. Curse attains him not, nor witchcraft, nor scorching; *víṣkandha*  
reaches him not who beareth thee, O ointment.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *tam* for *enam* in **a**, and *niṣkandham* in **c**. ⌊it  
inserts just before our vs. 7 the vs. given under vi. 76. 4 and ending  
with *yas tvāṁ bibharty āñjana.*⌋

No imprecation reaches him, no magic, no tormenting fiend, O Salve, Vishkandha seizes not the man who carries thee about.
