### Comment
Found mostly in Pāipp. viii. (in the verse-order 9, 3, 2, 5, 6, 8, 10, 4, 7). Used by Kāuś. (58. 8) with the binding on of an ointment-amulet, in a ceremony for long life of the Vedic pupil after his initiation. And the comm. quotes it from the Nakṣ. K. (19) ⌊error for śānti, says BI.⌋, as employed in the mahāśānti called āirāvatī.
