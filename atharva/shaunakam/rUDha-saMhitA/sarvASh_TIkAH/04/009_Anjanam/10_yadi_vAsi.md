### Translation
10. If thou art of the three-peaked \[mountain\], or if thou art called  
of the Yamunā—both thy names are excellent; by them protect us, O  
ointment.

### Notes
*Te* in **c** might perhaps be emended with advantage to *té*. The  
Yamunā is not elsewhere mentioned in AV. *Nā́mnī* is to be read, of  
course, as of three syllables, and there is no reason why the text  
should not give us *nā́manī*.

If thou art from the Three-peaked hill or hast thy name from Yamuna, These names are both auspicious: by these two protect thou us, O Salve!
