### Translation
8. Three are the slaves (*dāsá*) of the ointment—fever (*takmán*),  
*balā́sa*, then snake: the highest of mountains, three-peaked  
(*trikakúd*) by name, \[is\] thy father.

### Notes
For the obscure *balāsa*, the comm. gives the worthless etymology *balam  
asyati*, and adds *saṁnipātādiḥ* 'collision \[of humors\] or the like';  
"snake" he explains as for snake-poisoning; perhaps, if the reading is  
genuine, it is rather the name of some (constricting?) disease.
