### Translation
9. The ointment that is of the three-peaked \[mountain\], born from the  
snowy one (*himávant*)—may it grind up all the familiar demons and all  
the sorceresses.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Pāda **b** is repeated below as v. 4. 2 **b**. The first half-verse is,  
without variant, TA. vi. 10. 2, vs. 9 **a, b**; and it occurs also in  
HGS. (i. 11. 5), which reads *upari* at the end for *pari* ⌊and so at  
MP. ii. 8. 11 **a, b**⌋. The second half is VS. xvi. 5 **c, d**, and  
also found in TS. iv. 5. 1² and MS. ii. 9. 2; all these have *áhīn*  
instead of *yātū́n*, and read *jambháyan* (pres. pple.); and our  
*jambháyat* may, of course, be pres. pple. neut.; some of the mss.  
(including our Bp.M.I.) indeed read *-yan* here, though no masc. subject  
is implied; the comm. paraphrases with *nāśayad vartate*. SPP., with his  
customary defiance of grammar upon this point, reads *sárvān* instead of  
*-āṅ* or *-ān̄* ⌊cf. i. 1 9. 4, note⌋.
