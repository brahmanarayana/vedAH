### Translation
9. Terrible are Indra's missiles, a hundred spears of gold; with them  
let him push out the oblation-eating, *ávakā*-eating Gandharvas.

### Notes
This very slightly varied repetition of vs. 8 is wanting in Ppp. All the  
mss. have *ṛṣatu* at the end here.

With those dread hundred golden spears, the darts of Indra, let it pierce. The Blyxa-fed Gandharvas, those who bring no sacrificial gift.
