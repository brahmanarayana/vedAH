### Translation
4. Where \[are\] the *aśvatthás*, the *nyagródhas*, great trees, with  
crests: thither go away, ye Apsarases; ye have been recognized.

### Notes
The division and numbering in our edition of this verse and the two next  
following is faulty, owing to the unclearness of the mss. first used;  
the correct division, agreeing with the Anukr., is given by SPP., and  
our translation follows it ⌊and makes clear what it is⌋; vss. 3-5 all  
end with the refrain *tát páre ’tā-* etc., and this, with the number 4,  
needs to be added in our text after *śikhaṇḍínaḥ*. In Ppp., the place of  
this verse is taken by the addition reported above, under vs. 3. The  
comm. takes *śikhaṇḍin* as meaning "peacocks"; he quotes TS. iii. 4. 84  
to the effect that certain trees, including *aśvattha* and *nyagrodha*,  
are the houses of Gandharvas and Apsarases.

Where great trees are, Asvatthas and Nyagrodhas with their leafy crests, There where your swings are green and bright, and lutes and cymbals sound in tune, 'Ye have become attentive since the Apsarases have past away.
