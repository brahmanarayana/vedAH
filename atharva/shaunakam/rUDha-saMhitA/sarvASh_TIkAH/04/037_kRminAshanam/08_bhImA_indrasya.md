### Translation
8. Terrible are Indra's missiles (*hetí*), a hundred spears of iron;  
with them let him push out the oblation-eating, *ávakā*-eating  
Gandharvas.

### Notes
Half our mss., and the large majority of SPP's, read at the end of this  
verse *ṛṣata;* both editions give *ṛṣatu*, as in the next verse. *Avakā*  
is defined as a certain grass-like marsh-plant, *Blyxa octandra*, the  
same with *śāivala* or *śāivāla;* the comm. defines it as *jaloparisthāḥ  
śāivālaviśeṣāḥ*, but attempts no explanation of why the Gandharvas  
should be supposed to eat it. He reads in **b** *śatapṛṣṭīs* (one feels  
tempted to emend rather to *śatábhṛṣṭīs*), and in **c** *abhihradān*  
(for *haviradān*). The Anukr. takes no notice of the redundant syllable  
in **c** (also in 9 **c**).

With those dread hundred iron spears, the darts of Indra, let it pierce. The Blyxa-fed Gandharvas, those who bring no sacrificial gift.
