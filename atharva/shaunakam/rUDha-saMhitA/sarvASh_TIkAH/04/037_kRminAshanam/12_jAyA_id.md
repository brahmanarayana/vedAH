### Translation
12. Your wives, verily, are the Apsarases; O Gandharvas, ye are  
\[their\] husbands; run away, O immortal ones; fasten not on mortals.

### Notes
All the pada-mss. commit in **c** the palpable error of dividing  
*dhāvatāmartyā*(*ḥ*) into *dhāvata: martyāḥ*, as if the *ā* which  
follows *dhāvat-* were one of the common prolongations of a final vowel  
in *saṁhitā;* the comm., however, understands *amartyāḥ*, and SPP.  
admits this by emendation into his *pada*-text. Ppp. has for **c**  
*apakrāmat puruṣād amartyā*, which supports *amartyās* in our text.

Your wives are the Apsarases, and ye, Gandharvas, are their lords. Run ye, immortal ones, away: forbear to interfere with men!
