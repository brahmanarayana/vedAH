### Translation
7. Of the hither-dancing, crested Gandharva, Apsaras-lord, I split the  
testicles, I bind fast (?) the member.

### Notes
All the mss. read in **c** *ápi yāmi*, which SPP. accordingly retains;  
our emendation to *dyāmi* is unsatisfactory, both as regards the sense  
and because *dā* is not elsewhere used with *api* (neither is *yā*); one  
might also guess *abhí yāmi* "attack"; the comm. explains it by  
*apigataṁ niruddhaṁ karomi*, which is worthless. The comm. gives  
"peacock" as an alternative equivalent of *śikhaṇḍin* with an implied  
comparison: "dancing like a peacock." Ppp. begins with *īyaṁ vīruc  
chikh-*. ⌊If the definition of the Anukr. (8 + 8: 12) is right, pāda  
**c** lacks a syllable.⌋
