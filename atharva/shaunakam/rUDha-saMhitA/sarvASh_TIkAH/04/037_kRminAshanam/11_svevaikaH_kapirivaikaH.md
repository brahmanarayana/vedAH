### Translation
11. One as it were a dog, one as it were an ape, a boy all hairy—having  
become as it were dear to see, the Gandharva fastens upon (*sac*) women;  
him we make disappear from here by \[our\] mighty (*vīryàvant*)  
incantation (*bráhman*).

### Notes
In our edition, *stríyam* at the end of **d** is a misprint for  
*stríyas*, which all the mss. have, with no *avasāna*-mark following,  
though distinctly called for by the sense, and therefore supplied by us;  
Ppp., however, reads *striyam*, with *sajate* before it; and it omits  
the last pāda, **f**: which omission would furnish an excuse for the  
absence of interpunction after *stríyas.*

Youthful, completely decked with hair, one monkey-like, one like a dog,-- So the Gandharva, putting on a lovely look, pursues a dame. Him with an efficacious charm we scare and cause to vanish hence.
