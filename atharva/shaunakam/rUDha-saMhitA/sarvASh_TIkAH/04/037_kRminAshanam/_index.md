### Comment
Found (except vs. 9) in Pāipp. xiii. (in the verse-order 1-4, 7, 6, 5, 12, 8, 10, 11), but in a much defaced condition. Used by Kāuś. with the preceding hymn, as one of the cātanāni (8. 25); but also independently (28. 9) in a remedial rite against possession by evil spirits. And the comm. quotes it from Nakṣ. K. 21 ⌊error for śānti K., says Bloomfield⌋, as employed in a mahāśānti called gāndharvī. ⌊As to Bādarāyaṇi, see introduction to hymn 40.⌋


### Translations
Translated: Kuhn, KZ. xiii. 118 (interesting Germanic parallels); Ludwig, p. 352; Griffith, i. 180; Bloomfield, 33, 408; Weber, xviii. 144.
