### Translation
3. Let this man be riches-lord of riches; let this king be people-lord  
of people; in him, O Indra, put great splendors; destitute of splendor  
make thou his foe.

### Notes
As noted above, TB. combines the last three pādas of this verse with our  
1 **a**; it reads *asmāí* instead of *asmín* at beginning of **c**. The  
comm. foolishly gives himself much vain trouble to prove that the  
epithets in **a** and **b** are not repetitious.

Let him be treasure-lord of goodly treasures, let him as King be master of the people. Grant unto him great power and might, O Indra, and strip his enemy of strength and vigour.
