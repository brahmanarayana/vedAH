### Translation
4. For him, O heaven-and-earth, milk ye much that is pleasant (*vāmá*),  
like two milch kine that yield the hot-draught (*gharmá-*); may this  
king be dear to Indra, dear to kine, herbs, cattle.

### Notes
Ppp. combines *dughe ’va* in **b**, and has *bhūyās* in **c**; and at  
the end it agrees with TB. in reading *utā́ ’pā́m* for *paśūnā́m*. TB.  
further has *asmé* in **a**, and *-dúghe ’va dhenúḥ* in **b** ⌊but see  
Prāt. i. 82 n.⌋; and it prefixes *sám* to *duhāthām*. Probably it is the  
loss of that prefix or of some other that causes *duhāthām* to stand in  
all the mss. without accent at the beginning of the pāda: an  
inadmissible anomaly, though read in both texts; we ought to have  
emended to *duhā́thām*. The comm. explains that *gharma-* in **b**  
signifies the *pravargya*. ⌊The meter requires the prefix.⌋
