### Translation
5. I join to thee Indra who gives superiority (? *utttarā́vant*), by whom  
men conquer, are not conquered; who shall make thee sole chief of people  
(*jána*), also uppermost of kings descended from Manu.

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **a** *tam uttarāvantam indra*. TB. has in **b** *jáyāsi*  
and *parājáyāsāi*, and in the second half-verse *sá tvā ’kar ekavṛṣabháṁ  
svā́nām átho rājann utt-*. The comm. explains *uttarā́vantam* by  
*atiśayitotkarṣavantam*.

I join in league with thee victorious Indra, with whom men conquer and are ne'er defeated. He shall make thee the folk's sole lord and leader, shall make thee highest of all human rulers.
