### Translation
7. Of lion-aspect, do thou devour (*ad*) all the clans (*viś*); of  
tiger-aspect, do thou beat down the foes; sole chief, having Indra as  
companion, having conquered, seize thou on (*ā-khid*) the enjoyments of  
them that play the foe.

### Notes
Ppp. has only the second half-verse, and reads for **d** *śatrūyatām  
abhi tiṣṭhā mahāṅsi* (our vii. 73. 10 etc.: see under that verse). The  
whole verse is wanting in TB. The comm., with one of SPP's mss., reads  
*ápa* for *áva* in **b**. He paraphrases *addhi* (which is a frequent  
expression for the action of a ruler upon his subjects) very properly by  
*bhun̄kṣva;* and *ā khida*, less acceptably, by *ācchindhi*.
