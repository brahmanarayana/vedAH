### Translation
1. Born from the wind out of the atmosphere, out from the light of  
lightning, let this gold-born shell, of pearl, protect us from distress.

### Notes
Of course, all the four nouns in the first half-verse may be coördinate  
ablatives. The beauty and sheen of the material connect it traceably  
with gold and lightning, but how even a Hindu *ṛṣi* can bring it into  
relation with wind from (or and) the atmosphere is not easy to see.  
*Kṛ́śana* ought to mean the pearl itself, and is perhaps used in the hymn  
appositively = "which is itself virtually pearl"; the comm. explains it  
in this verse as *karśayitā śatrūṇāṁ tanūkartā*. Ppp. has in **c**  
*hiraṇyadās*.
