### Translation
7. The gods' bone became pearl; that goes about within the waters,  
possessing soul; that do I bind on thee in order to life-time, splendor,  
strength, to length of life for a hundred autumns: let \[the amulet\] of  
pearl defend thee.

### Notes
*Karśanás* in **e**, though read by all our mss. and nearly all of  
SPP's, is hardly to be tolerated; we should have either *kṛ́śanas*, as  
above, or *kārśanas*, which the comm. offers, with two or three mss.  
that follow him, and which SPP. accordingly adopts ⌊*kārśanás*⌋; our  
edition gives *karś-*; Ppp. has *kārṣiṇas*. Ppp. also has simply *ca*  
for our whole **d** (after *balāya*). The comm. reads *asti* instead of  
*asthi* in **a**. The verse (11 + 11: 14 + 11 + 8 = 55) lacks a syllable  
of being a full *śakvarī*. ⌊Reject either *āyuṣe* or *varcase* and the  
meter is good.—In **c**, *te* 'for thee' (comm., as gen.), is, I  
suppose, virtually = 'on thee.'⌋ The second *anuvāka*, ending with this  
hymn, contains 5 hymns and 39 verses; the Anukr. quotation is *nava ca*.

Bone of the Good became the pearl's shell-mother endowed with soul it moveth in the waters. I bind this on thee for life, strength, and vigour, for long life lasting through a hundred autumns. May the pearl's mother keep and guard thee safely!
