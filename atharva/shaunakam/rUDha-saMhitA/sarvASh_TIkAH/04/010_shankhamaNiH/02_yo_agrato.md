### Translation
2. Thou that wast born from the top of the shining spaces (*rocaná*),  
out of the ocean—by the shell having slain the demons, we overpower the  
devourers.

### Notes
Ppp. combines in **a** *yo ‘grato r-*. Grill takes *agratas* as "first";  
and the comm. as = *agre*, and not qualifying *jajñiṣe:* "at the top or  
front of shining things, such as stars."
