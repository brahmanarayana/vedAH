### Translation
3. By the shell \[we overpower\] disease, misery; by the shell also the  
*sadā́nvās;* let the all-healing shell, of pearl, protect us from  
distress.

### Notes
Ppp. has in **a** *avadyam* instead of *ámatim*. The comm. takes  
*ámatim* from root *man* ⌊see BR's note, s.v. 3 *ámati*⌋: "ignorance,  
the root of all mishap (*anartha*); and, forgetting his explanation of  
only two verses ago, he this time declares *kṛśana* a "name of gold."

We stay disease and indigence, and chase Sadanvas with the Shell. May the all-healing Shell that bears the pearl preserve us from distress.
