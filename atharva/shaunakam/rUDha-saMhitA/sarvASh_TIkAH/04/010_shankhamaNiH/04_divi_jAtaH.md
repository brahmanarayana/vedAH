### Translation
4. Born in the sky, ocean-born, brought hither out of the river, this  
gold-born shell \[is\] for us a life-prolonging amulet.

### Notes
Ppp. has *samudratas* at end of **a**, and in **c** again (as in 1  
**c**) *hiraṇyadās*. Nearly all our mss. (except O.K.), and some of  
SPP's, with the comm., read in **d** *āyuḥpr-* ⌊cf. Prāt, ii. 62 n.⌋;  
but the point is one in regard to which each ms. is wont to follow its  
own course, regardless of rule, and both editions very properly give  
*āyuṣpr-*, as required by the Prāt.
