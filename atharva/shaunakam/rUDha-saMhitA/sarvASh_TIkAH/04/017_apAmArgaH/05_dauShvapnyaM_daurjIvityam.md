### Translation
5. Evil-dreaming, evil-living, demon, monster (*abhvà*), hags, all the  
ill-named (f.), ill-voiced—them we make disappear from us.

### Notes
Ppp. has in **a** *dussvapnaṁ durjīvataṁ*, and, for **c, d**, *durvācas  
sarvaṁ durbhūtaṁ tam ito nāś-*. A couple of our mss. (I.H.p.m.) read  
*abhū́m* in **b**. The comm. gives *-jīvatyam* in **a** (with two of  
SPP's mss.), and (with our P.M.W.E.) *asmín* instead of *asmán* in  
**d**. He first defines *abhvam* simply as "great," and then as a  
special kind of demon or demoniac (quoting RV. i. 185. 2); and the  
*durṇāmnīs* as *piśācīs* having various bad appellations, such as  
*chedikā* and *bhedikā*. The verse is repeated as vii. 23. 1.
