### Translation
3. She that hath cursed with cursing, that hath taken malignity as her  
root, that hath seized on \[our\] young to take \[its\] sap—let her eat  
\[her own\] offspring.

### Notes
The verse is a repetition of i. 28. 3, and the comm. again, as there,  
reads *ādade* at end of **b**. He notes that a full explanation has been  
already given, but yet allows himself to repeat it in brief; this time  
he gives only *mūrchāpradam* as the sense of *mūram*. Ppp. (which has no  
version of i. 28) gives here, for **c, d**, *yā vā rathasya prāsāre hy  
ato ‘gham u tvasaḥ*. As i. 28. 3, the verse was properly called  
*virāṭpathyābṛhatī*. ⌊Correct the verse-number from 6 to 3 in the  
edition.⌋

She who hath cursed us with a curse, or hath conceived a murderous sin, Or seized our son to take his blood, may she devour the child she bare.
