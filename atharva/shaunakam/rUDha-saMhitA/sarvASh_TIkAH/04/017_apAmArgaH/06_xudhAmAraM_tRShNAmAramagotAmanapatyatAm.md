### Translation
6. Death by hunger, death by thirst, kinelessness, childlessness—through  
thee, O off-wiper (*apāmārgá*), we wipe off all that.

### Notes
The translation implies the obvious emendation of *anapadyátām* (p.  
*anapa॰dyátam*) in **b** to *-apatyá-*, which is read by the comm. and  
by three of SPP's mss. which follow him; SPP. very properly admits  
*-apatyá-* into his text (but forgets to emend his *pada-*text  
thoroughly, and leaves in it the absurd division *anapaa॰tyátām*.)  
⌊Weber, however, discussing *avadya*, *Berliner Sb.*, 1896, p. 272,  
defends the reading *apadya-*.⌋ The comm. says nothing of the sudden  
change here from *sahadevī* to *apāmārga*, which ought to be another  
plant (*Achyranthes aspera:* a weed found all over India, having very  
long spikes of retroflected flowers), but may possibly be used here as a  
synonym or appellation of the other. In his introduction, he speaks of  
*darbha, apāmārga*, and *sahadevī* as infused in the consecrated water.
