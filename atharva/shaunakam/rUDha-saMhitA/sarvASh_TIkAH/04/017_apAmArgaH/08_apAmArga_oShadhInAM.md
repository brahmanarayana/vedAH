### Translation
8. The off-wiper is indeed of all herbs the sole controller (*vaśín*);  
with it we wipe \[off\] what has befallen (*ā́sthita*) thee; then do thou  
go about free from disease.

### Notes
Ppp. (in book ii.) has for **b** *viśvāsām eka it patiḥ*, combines in  
**c** *mṛjmā ”sthitam*, and reads at the end *caraḥ*. *Āsthitam* (also  
vi. 14. 1 and VS. vi. 15) has perhaps a more special sense than we are  
able to assign to it; the comm. paraphrases by *kṛtyādibhir āpatitaṁ  
rogādikam*.
