### Translation
4. Also whoso should creep far off beyond the sky, he should not be  
released from king Varuṇa; from the sky his spies go forth hither;  
thousand-eyed, they look over the earth.

### Notes
Only the second and third pādas are found in Ppp. (and, as noted above,  
not in company with the main part of the hymn), which gives *iha* for  
*divas* and *ime ‘sya* for *idam asya* (both in **c**). The  
*saṁhitā*-mss., as usual, vary between *diváḥ* and *divá* before *sp-*.  
The comm. has *purastāt* in **a**.

If one should flee afar beyond the heaven, King Varuna would still be round about him. Proceeding hither from the sky his envoys look, thousand-eyed, over the earth beneath them.
