### Translation
8. The Varuṇa that is lengthwise (*samāmyà*), that is crosswise  
(*vyāmyà*); the Varuṇa that is of the same region (*saṁdeśyà*), that is  
of a different region (*videśyà*); the Varuṇa that is of the gods, and  
that is of men—

### Notes
If the word *váruṇas*, thrice repeated, were left out, there would  
remain a regular *gāyatrī;* and the meaning would be greatly improved  
also; if we retain it, we must either emend to *varuṇa*, vocative, or to  
*vāruṇás* 'of Váruṇa,' i.e. 'his fetter,' or else we must understand  
*váruṇas* as here strangely used in the sense of *vāruṇás:* the comm.  
makes no difficulty of doing the last. ⌊Ppp. reads in **a**, *yas  
sāmānyo;* in **b**, *yaś śyaṁdeśyo* (or *cyaṁ-*); in **c**, *yo dāivyo  
varuṇo yaś ca mānuṣassa;* and adds *tvāṅs tv etāni prati muñcāmy atra.*⌋  
For the first two epithets compare xviii. 4. 70; the next two are  
variously understood by the translators; they are rendered here in  
accordance with the comm. Though so differently defined by the Anukr.  
⌊cf. ii. 3. 6 n.⌋, the verse as it stands is the same with vs. 9, namely  
11 × 3 = 33 syllables.

Varuna sends, and drives away, diseases: Varuna is both native and a stranger, Varuna is celestial and is human.
