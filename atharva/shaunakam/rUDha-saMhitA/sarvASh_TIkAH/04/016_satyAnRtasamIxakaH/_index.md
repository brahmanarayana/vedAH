### Comment
Five verses of this hymn (in the verse-order 3, 2, 5, 8, 7) are found together in Pāipp. v., and parts of vss. 4 and 6 elsewhere in the same book. It is used by Kāuś. (48. 7) in a rite of sorcery against an enemy who "comes cursing"; and vs. 3 also in the portent-ceremony of the seven seers (127. 3), with praise to Varuṇa.


By reason of the exceptional character of this hymn as expression of the unrestricted presence and influence of superhuman powers, it has been a favorite subject of translation and discussion. Translated: Roth, Ueber den AV., p. 29; Max Müller, Chips from a German Workshop, i. 41 (1867); Muir, OST. v. 63; Ludwig, p. 388; Muir, Metrical Translations, p. 163; Kaegi, Der Rigveda2, p 89 f. (or p. 65 f. of R. Arrowsmith's translation of Kaegi), with abundant parallels from the Old Testament; Grill, 32, 126; Griffith, i. 153; Bloomfield, 88, 389; Weber, xviii. 66. Some of the above do not cover the entire hymn.—See also Hillebrandt, Veda-chrestomathie, p. 38; Bergaigne-Henry, Manuel, p. 146; further, Grohmann, Ind. Stud. ix. 406; Hermann Brunnhofer, Iran und Turan (1889), p. 188-196; Weber, Berliner Sb., 1894, p. 782 f.


⌊Weber entitles the hymn "Betheuerung der Unschuld, Eidesleistung"; see his instructive note, Ind. Stud. xviii. 66, note 2. "Comes cursing" hardly takes account of the voice of śapyamānam as used by Kāuś. 48. 7.⌋
