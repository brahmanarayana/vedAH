### Translation
5. All this king Varuna beholds (*vi-cakṣ*)—what is between the two  
firmaments (*ródasī*), what beyond; numbered of him are the winkings of  
people; as a gambler the dice, \[so\] does he fix (? *ni-mi*) these  
things.

### Notes
Ppp. reads for **d** *akṣān na śvaghnī bhuvanā mamīte*, which gives a  
rather more manageable sense; our text is probably corrupt (*ví  
cinoti?*); the comm. explains *ni minoti* by *ni kṣipati;* and to the  
obscure *tāni* (not relating to anything specified in the verse) he  
supplies *pāpināṁ śikṣākarmāṇi*. He has again (as in 4 **a**) *purastāt*  
in **b**; and in **c** he understands *saṁkhyātā* (not *-tāḥ*), as  
"enumerator," and *nimiṣas* as gen. with *asya*. He also reads in **d**  
*svaghnī*, and quotes and expands Yāska's derivation of the word from  
*sva + han*. The verse is *bhurij* if we insist on reading *iva* instead  
of *’va* in **d**. ⌊Read *’va*, or *akṣā́ñ śvaghnī́va*, or with Ppp.?⌋

All this the royal Varuna beholdeth, all between heaven and earth and all beyond them. The twinklings of men's eyelids hath he counted. As one who plays throws dice he settles all things.
