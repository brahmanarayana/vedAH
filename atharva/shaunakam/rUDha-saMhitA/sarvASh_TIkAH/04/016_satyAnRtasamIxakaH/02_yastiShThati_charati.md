### Translation
2. Whoso stands, goes about, and whoso goes crookedly (*vañc*), whoso  
goes about hiddenly, who defiantly (? *pratán̄kam*)—what two, sitting  
down together, talk, king Varuṇa, as third, knows that.

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **a** *manasā* instead of *carati*, and in **b**  
*pralāyam* instead of *pratan̄kam;* and for **c** it has *dvāu yad  
avadatas saṁniṣadya*. The *pada*-mss. give in **b** *ni॰lā́yan*, as if  
the assimilated final nasal before *c* were *n* instead of *m;* and SPP.  
unwisely leaves this uncorrected in his *pada*-text, although the comm.  
correctly understands *-yam*. The comm. regards **a** and **b** as  
specifying the "enemies" of vs. 1 **a**; *vañcati* he paraphrases by  
*kāuṭilyena pratārayati*, and *pratan̄kam* by *prakarṣeṇa kṛcchrajīvanam  
prāpya; nilāyam*\* he derives either from *nis + i* or from *ni + lī*.  
The true sense of *pratan̄kam* is very obscure; the translation seeks in  
it a contrast to *nilā́yam;* the translators mostly prefer a parallel  
"gliding, creeping," or the like. The Anukr. apparently balances the  
redundant **a** with the deficient **c**. \*⌊Note that W's version  
connects it with *ní-līna* of vs. 3; cf. *Gram.* §995 a, and my  
*Reader*, p. 394.⌋
