### Translation
9. With all those fetters I fasten (*abhi-sā*) thee, O so-and-so, of  
such-and-such a family, son of such-and-such a mother; and all of them I  
successively appoint for thee.

### Notes
If the verse is regarded as metrical, with three pādas (and it scans  
very fairly as such), we ought to accent *ásāu* ⌊voc. of *asāú*⌋ at  
beginning of **b**. The comm. perhaps understands *anu* in **c** as  
independent, *ánu* (SPP. so holds). The last two verses are, as it were,  
the practical application of vss. 6 and 7, and probably added later. ⌊As  
to the naming of the names, see Weber's note, p. 73.⌋

I bind and hold thee fast with all these nooses, thou son of such a man and such a mother. All these do I assign thee as thy portion.
