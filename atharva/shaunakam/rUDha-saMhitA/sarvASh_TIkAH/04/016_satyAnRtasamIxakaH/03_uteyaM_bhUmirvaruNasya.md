### Translation
3. Both this earth is king Varuṇa's, and yonder great sky with distant  
margins (*-ánta*); also the two oceans are Varuṇa's paunches; also in  
this petty water is he hidden.

### Notes
Ppp. has, for **a, b**, *ute ’yam asya pṛthivī samīcī dyāur bṛhatīr  
antarikṣam;* and, at end of **d**, *udakena maktāḥ*. The comm. declares  
that the epithets in **b** belong to "earth" as well as to "sky";  
*kukṣī* he paraphrases by *dakṣiṇottarapārśvabhedenā ’vasthite dve  
udare*.

This earth, too, is King Varuna's possession, and the high heaven whose ends are far asunder. The loins of Varuna are both the oceans, and this small drop of water, too, contains him.
