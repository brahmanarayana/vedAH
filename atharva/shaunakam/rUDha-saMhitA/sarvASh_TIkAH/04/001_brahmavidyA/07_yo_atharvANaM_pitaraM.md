### Translation
7. Whoso shall approach (? *ava-gam*) with homage father Atharvan,  
relative of the gods, Brihaspati—in order that thou mayest be generator  
of all, poet, god, not to be harmed, self-ruling (? *svadhā́vant*).

### Notes
The translation implies in **d** emendation of *dábhāyat* to *dábhāya;*  
both editions have the former, with all the mss. and the comm. (who  
comfortably explains it by *dabhnoti* or *hinasti*). The comm. also  
reads in **b** *bṛhaspatis;* and this is supported by the Ppp. version:  
*yathā vā ’tharvā pitaraṁ viśvadevaṁ bṛhaspatir manasā vo datsva:* and  
so on (**c, d** defaced). The comm. takes *ava gachāt* as = *jānīyāt*,  
and *svadhāvān* as 'joined with food in the form of oblation."

The man who seeks the friend of Gods, Atharvan the father, and Brihaspati, with worship, Crying to him, Be thou all things' creator! the wise God, self- dependent, never injures.
