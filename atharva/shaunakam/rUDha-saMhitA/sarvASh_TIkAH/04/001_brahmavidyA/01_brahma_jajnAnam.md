### Translation
1. The *bráhman* that was first born of old (*purástāt;* in the east?)  
Vena hath unclosed from the well-shining edge (*sīmatás;* horizon?); he  
unclosed the fundamental nearest shapes (*viṣṭhā́*) of it, the womb  
(*yóni*) of the existent and of the non-existent.

### Notes
The verse occurs in a large number of other texts: SV. (i. 321), VS.  
(xiii. 3), TS. (iv. 2. 8²), TB. (ii. 8. 8⁸), TA. (x. 1, vs. 42), MS.  
(ii. 7. 15), K. (xvi. 15 et al.), Kap. (25. 5 et al.), śśS. (v. 9. 5),  
AśS. (iv. 6. 3); and its pratīka in AB. (i. 19), GB. (ii. 2. 6)—and,  
what is very remarkable, everywhere without a variant; it is also  
repeated below as v. 6. 1. Vena is, even in the exposition of the verse  
given by śB. (vii. 4. 1. 14), explained as the sun, and so the comm.  
regards it, but very implausibly; the moon would better suit the  
occurrences of the word. The comm. gives both renderings to *purástāt*  
in **a**, and three different explanations of the pāda. In **b**, the  
translation takes *surúcas* as qualifying the virtual ablative *sīmatás*  
⌊which Weber takes as *sīm átas!* see also Whitney's note to Prāt. iii.  
43⌋; the comm. views it as accus. pl., and so does śB.; the latter makes  
it mean "these worlds," the former either that or "its own shining  
brightnesses." Pāda **c** is the most obscure of all; śB. simply  
declares it to designate the quarters (*díśas*); the comm. gives  
alternative interpretations, of no value; *upamā́s* (p. *upa॰mā́ḥ*, as if  
from root *mā* with *upa*) he paraphrases with *upamīyamānāḥ  
parichidyamānāḥ*.

Eastward at first the prayer was generated: Vena disclosed bright flashes from the summit, Disclosed his deepest, nearest revelations, womb of the non- existent and existent.
