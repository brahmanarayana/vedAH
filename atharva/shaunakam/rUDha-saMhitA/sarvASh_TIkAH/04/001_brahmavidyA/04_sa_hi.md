### Translation
4. For he of the heaven, he of the earth the right-stander, fixed  
(*skabh*) \[as his\] abode (*kṣéma*) the (two) great firmaments  
(*ródasī*) the great one, when born, fixed apart the (two) great ones,  
the heaven \[as\] seat (*sádman*) and the earthly space (*rájas*).

### Notes
Ppp., after our vs. 3, makes a verse out of our 4 **c, d** and 5 **a,  
b**; and then, after our vs. 6, another verse out of our 4 **a, b** and  
5 **c, d**; and TS. (ii. 3. 14⁶) and AśS. (iv. 6. 3) combine our 4 **c,  
d** and 5 **a, b** in the same way (omitting the rest), while AB. (i.  
19. 3) virtually supports them, by giving our **c** as a pratīka. All  
the three read in **c** *astabhāyat* (TS. without accent), and AśS.  
intrudes *pitā* after *dyām* in **d**. In our text we ought to have not  
only (with TS.) *askabhāyat* in **c**, but also *āsk-* in **b**; the  
accents seem to have been exchanged by a blunder. The comm. makes the  
sun the "he" of **a**; he renders *kṣémam* in **b** by *avināśo yathā  
bhavati;* and *ví* in **c** apparently by *vyāpya vartamānaḥ*. The  
Anukr. passes unnoticed the deficiency of a syllable (unless we resolve  
*pa-árth-*) in **d**. ⌊In a supplementary note, R. reports Ppp. as  
reading in **a, b** *sa hi vṛtha-* (?) *ṛceṣṭhā mayi kṣāmaṁ bhrajasī  
viṣkabhāyati*, and as giving *jitaḥ* for *sádma* in **d**.⌋

For he, true to the law of Earth and Heaven, established both the mighty worlds securely. Mighty when born, he propped apart the mighty, the sky, our earthly home, and air's mid-region.
