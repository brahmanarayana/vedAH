### Translation
9. Do thou envelop with cooked skin the cooked goat, brought together  
with all his limbs, all-formed. Do thou rise up from here unto the  
highest firmament (*nā́ka*); with thy four feet stand firm in the  
quarters.

### Notes
One would expect in **a** rather *áśṛtayā*, as the hide can hardly have  
been cooked; the comm. reads instead *śrathayā*, explaining it as  
*viśasanena vibhaktayā;* but no such word as *śratha* appears to be  
found elsewhere, and both it and its interpretation are very  
implausible. To *tvacā* he adds "having the feet, tail, and head on."  
The verses read as if the goat himself, after cooking whole, were set up  
in position, the head to the east. The Anukr. does not heed that the  
second and fourth pādas are *triṣṭubh*. ⌊Ppp. has *śrutam ekaṁ  
śrutayā.*⌋

O'er the dressed Goat lay a dressed skin to robe him prepared, in perfect form, with all his members. Rise upward to the loftiest vault of heaven: with thy four feet stand firmly in the regions.
