### Translation
8. In the western quarter set his rump (*bhasád*); in the northern  
(*úttara*) quarter set his other (*úttara*) side; in the upward quarter  
set the goat's back-bone; in the fixed quarter set his belly (?  
*pājasyà*); midway in the atmosphere his middle.

### Notes
The comm. explains *pājasyàm* thus: *pāja iti balanāma: tatra hitam  
udaragatam ūvadhyam;* and *dhehi* in connection with it as meaning *ni  
khana*—which looks quite improbable. It is only by violence that this  
verse can be extended to 60 syllables, as the Anukr. requires. ⌊Reject  
*diśí* in **b** and **c**, as in vs. 7, and combine *bhasádāsya*, and we  
get five good *triṣṭubh* pādas.⌋ Our edition inserts after *pājasyàm* an  
*avasāna*-mark which is wanting in the mss. and in SPP's text.
