### Translation
7. Accompanied by five rice-messes (*-odaná*), by the five fingers, with  
the spoon, take thou up five-fold that rice-mess. In the eastern quarter  
set thou the head of the goat; in the southern (*dákṣiṇa*) quarter set  
his right (*dákṣiṇa*) side.

### Notes
Verses 7-9 are not found in other texts, not even in Ppp.\* The comm.  
(against the accent) explains *páñcāudanam* as *pañcadhā vibhaktam  
odanam; uddhara* as "take out of the kettle (*sthālī*) and set on the  
*barhis*"; and, both here and in the following verse, he substitutes for  
the actual part of the animal the cooked meat taken from such part, with  
the share of rice-mess that goes with it. The verse is a *jagatī* only  
by number of syllables (11 + 13: 11 + 13 = 48; each pāda ⌊save **b**⌋  
has trochaic close). ⌊Reject *diśí* in **d** and scan as 11 + 12: 11 +  
11⌋ \*⌊In a supplementary note, Roth says that they do occur (as noted  
above) in Ppp. xvi.⌋
