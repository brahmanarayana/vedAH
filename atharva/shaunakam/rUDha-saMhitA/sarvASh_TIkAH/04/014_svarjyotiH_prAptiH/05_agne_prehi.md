### Translation
5. O Agni, go forth first of the divinities, eye of gods and of human  
beings (*mā́nuṣa*)—pressing on (? *íyakṣa-*) in unison with the Bhṛgus,  
let the sacrificers go to heaven (*svàr*), to well-being.

### Notes
The other texts (VS. xvii. 69; TS. and MS. as above) all read  
*mártyānām* at end of **b**; and for *devátānām* in **a** VS.TS. have  
*devayatā́m*, MS. *devāyatā́m;* and Ppp. also reads *martyānām* and  
*devayatām;* in **c**, MS. has *sahá* for *sajóṣās*. The comm.  
paraphrases *cakṣus* by *cakṣurindriyavat priyaḥ*, and *iyakṣamāṇās* by  
*yaṣṭum icchantaḥ*.

First among all the deities, come forward, thou who art eye of Gods and men, O Agni. Imploring, and accordant with the Bhrigus, to heaven in safety go the sacrificers!
