### Translation
1. Since the goat has been born from the heat of Agni (the fire), it saw  
\[its\] generator in the beginning; by it the gods in the beginnings  
attained (*i*) \[their\] godhead; by (with?) it the sacrificial ones  
(*médhya*) ascended the ascents (*róha*).

### Notes
Found also in VS. (xiii. 51), MS. (ii. 7. 17; like VS. throughout), and  
TS. (iv. 2. 10⁴). VS. and MS. have in **c, d** *devátām ágram āyaṅs téna  
róham āyann úpa médh-*. TS. has at the beginning *ajā́*, and,  
correspondingly, *sā́* (with *vāí* added) in **b**, and *táyā* in **c**  
and **d**; it also reverses the order of **c** and **d**, agreeing  
otherwise with VS. MS. in **d**, but having *ágre*, like AV., in **c**;  
it also replaces *śókāt* by *gárbhāt* in **a**. We have **a** again  
below as ix. 5. 13 **a**; and **c** is nearly equivalent to iii. 22. 3  
**c**: moreover the *pada*-mss., here as there, misinterpret *āyaṅ*  
before *téna* as *āyam*, which SPP. properly corrects to *āyan* in his  
*pada*-text; all our *saṁhitā*-mss. read *āyaṅ*. The comm. declares *hí*  
in **a** to be intended to intimate that the same statement was made in  
another text also; and he quotes TS. ii. 1. 1⁴; *róha* he explains by  
*svargādiloka; téna* he takes both times as designating the means. The  
Anukr. takes no notice of the deficiency of a syllable in **b**. ⌊As to  
*ajá*, see Weber, *Berliner Sb.*, 1895, p. 847 n.⌋

The Goat was verily produced from Agni. Through sorrow he beheld, at first, his father. Through him at first the Gods attained to godhead, and, meet for sacrifices, were exalted.
