### Translation
2. Stride ye with the fire to the firmament (*nā́ka*), bearing in your  
hands vessel-\[fires\] (*úkhya*); having gone to the back of the sky, to  
the heaven (*svàr*), sit ye mingled with the gods.

### Notes
The other texts (VS. xvii. 65; TS. iv. 6. 5¹; MS. ii. 10. 6) differ but  
slightly from ours: all have the sing. *úkhyam* at beginning of **b**,  
and TS.MS. combine *diváḥ p-* in **c**. Ppp. reads *agníbhis* in **a**,  
and *ekṣāṁ* for *úkhyān* in **b**; for the latter, the comm. (with one  
of SPP's mss.) gives *akṣān*, which he defines as *akṣavat prakāśakān  
anuṣṭhitān yajñān*. As usual, the mss. vary at the end between the  
equivalent *ādhvam* and *āddhvam;* our text reads the latter, SPP's the  
former.
