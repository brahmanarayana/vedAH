### Translation
4. The well-born Jātavedas, the mighty (*vibhú*) Agni belonging to all  
men (*vāiśvānará*), the carrier of oblations, we call on: let him free  
us from distress.

### Notes
The verse, as already noticed, comes second in the Ppp. version of the  
hymn. The comm. explains *vibhu* as "pervading" (*vyāpaka*).
