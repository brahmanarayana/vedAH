### Translation
7. In whose direction \[is\] whatever shines forth (*vi-ruc*) here, what  
is born and to be born, all of it—I praise Agni, \[as a\] suppliant I  
call loudly on \[him\]—let him free us from distress.

### Notes
TS. and MS. have a quite different first half-verse: *yásye ’dám prāṇán  
nimiṣád yád éjati yásya jātáṁ jánamānaṁ ca kévalam*. The comm. renders  
*nāthitas* first by *nāthamānaḥ, phalaṁ kāmayamānaḥ*, and then by  
*nāthaḥ svāmī saṁjāto ‘sya*.

I, suppliant, praise and ever call on Agni, sole Lord of all this world, of all that shineth, Of what exists and shall exist hereafter. May he deliver us from grief and trouble.
