### Translation
1. I reverence (*man-u*) first the forethoughtful (*prácetas*) Agni, him  
of the five peoples, whom men kindle in many places; we pray to him who  
hath entered (*pra-viś*) into clans after clans (*víś*): let him free us  
from distress.

### Notes
Ppp. has in **b** *pañcaj-*; the comm., *pāñcayajñasya*, for which he  
gives three different interpretations, the last one making *-yajñasya*  
equivalent to *-janasya*. *Manve* he paraphrases by *jānāmi*. In **a**,  
MS. has *amṛ́tānām* for *prácetasas;* for **b**, TS.MS. give *yám  
pā́ñcajanyam bahávaḥ samindháte;* and, for **c**, *víśvasyāṁ viśí  
praviviśivā́ṅsam īmahe*. ⌊The "absence of reduplication" (*Skt. Gram.*  
§803 a) is doubtless due to the oft-repeated syllable *vi* or *viś*. The  
pratīka is cited, MGS. 1. 5. 5—cf. p. 145.⌋ The Anukr., at the end of  
the descriptions of the seven hymns, says that all the verses  
contain—i.e. end with—an *anuṣṭubh* pāda. Its definitions of the meters  
in detail are too inaccurate to be worthy of attention throughout.

I fix my heart on wise and ancient Agni, the Five Tribes' Lord, in many a place enkindled. We seek him who hath entered all our houses. May he deliver us from grief and trouble.
