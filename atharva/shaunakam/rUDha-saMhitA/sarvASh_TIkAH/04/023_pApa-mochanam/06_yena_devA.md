### Translation
6. By whom the gods discovered the immortal; by whom they made the herbs  
rich in honey; by whom the gods brought the heaven (*svàr*)—let him free  
us from distress.

### Notes
The comm. takes *amṛta* in **a** as meaning the drink of immortality;  
more probably it signifies immortality itself.

Through whom the Gods discovered life eternal, through whom they stored the plants with pleasant juices, Through whom they brought to men the light of heaven. May he deliver us from grief and trouble.
