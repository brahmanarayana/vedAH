### Translation
3. Put to service at every course (*yā́man*), best carrier, sharer  
(*ā́bhaga*) at every rite, Agni I praise, demon-slayer,  
sacrifice-increaser, offered to with ghee: let him free us from  
distress.

### Notes
All the mss. (and SPP. with them) make the division of the verse, with  
obvious impropriety, before instead of after *agním īḍe*, being  
apparently led into the blunder by remembering the two words as  
beginning the Rig-Veda. The comm. gives the right division, as does also  
our edition by emendation. Nearly all the mss. (not our I.K.) read  
*báhiṣṭham* at end of **a**; both editions give *váh-*, with the comm.  
The comm. paraphrases *ā́bhagam* by *ābhaktavyam āsevyam  
evaṁguṇaviśiṣṭam*. ⌊The vs. scans as 11 + 11: 12 + 8 = 42. Even with the  
misdivision (11 + 7: 8 + 8 + 8), it is no *purastajjyotiṣmatī* (44).⌋

I pray to Agni in each act successful, employed in every sacrifice, the strongest, Fiend-slayer, served with fatness, strengthening worship. May he deliver us from grief and trouble.
