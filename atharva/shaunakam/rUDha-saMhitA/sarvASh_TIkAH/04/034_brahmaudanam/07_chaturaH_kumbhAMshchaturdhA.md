### Translation
7. Four vessels (*kumbhá*), four-fold, I give, filled with milk, with  
water, with curds—let all these etc. etc.

### Notes
Ppp. had the first two pādas, as noted above, in its vs. 5, reading for  
**a** *catuṣkumbhyāṁ caturdhā dadāti;* its vs. 7 is our 5 **c, d** (with  
the variants already given) together with the last two pādas of the  
refrain, reading *svadhayā* for *madhumat* in the former pāda, and *mā*  
for *tvā* in the latter. The comm. (with one or two of SPP's mss. that  
follow him) has *dadhāmi* in **a**.

I give four pitchers, in four several places, filled to the brim with milk and curds and water. Abundant with their overflow of sweetness, these streams shall reach thee in the world of Svarga, whole lakes with lotus- blossom shall approach thee.
