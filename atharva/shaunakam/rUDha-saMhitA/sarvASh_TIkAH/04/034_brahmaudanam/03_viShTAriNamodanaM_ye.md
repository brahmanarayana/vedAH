### Translation
3. Whoso cook the *viṣṭārín* rice-mess, ruin (*ávarti*) fastens not on  
them at any time; \[such a one\] stays (as) with Yama, goes to the gods,  
revels with the soma-drinking (*somyá*) Gandharvas.

### Notes
Ppp. has *kutas* for *kadā* in **b**, and *sāumyāis* in **d**. The  
*pada*-text writes *ávartiḥ* without division, yet the comment to Prāt.  
iii. 46 quotes the word as exemplifying the combination of final *a* and  
initial *ṛ*; the comm. understands and explains it as *a-vartti!*  
*somya* he paraphrases with *somārha*. The metrical irregularities (11 +  
12: 10 + 11 = 44) are ignored by the Anukr.
