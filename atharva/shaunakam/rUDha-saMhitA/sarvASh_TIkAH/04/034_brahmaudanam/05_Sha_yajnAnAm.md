### Translation
5. This, extended, is of sacrifices the best carrier; having cooked the  
*viṣṭārín*, one has entered the sky; the bulb-bearing lotus spreads  
(*sam-tam*), the *bísa, śālū́ka, śáphaka, mulālī́:* let all these streams  
(*dhā́rā*) come unto thee, swelling honeyedly in the heavenly (*svargá*)  
world; let complete (*sámanta*) lotus-ponds approach thee.

### Notes
The mss. (with the exception, doubtless accidental, of our P.K.) all  
read *báhiṣṭhas* at end of **a**, and this SPP. retains, while our text  
makes the obviously called-for emendation to *váh-*; the comm. has  
*vah-*. The things mentioned in **c, d** appear to be edible parts of  
water-lilies: the bulbous roots, leaf-stems, and radical fibres, which  
in some species, as the *Nymphaea esculenta*, are savory, and which are  
eaten somewhat like asparagus. That they should be viewed as special  
gifts to the pious indicates quite primitive conditions, and suggests a  
region abounding in standing waters. Either the pools and channels of  
Kāuś. are founded on these specifications, or they are original and  
intended to be emblematic of such products. The *kumuda* is the *N.  
esculenta* (*kāirava*, comm.); and the comm. explains *bisa* (he reads  
*visa*) as the root-bulb of the *padma* (*Nelumbium speciosum*) ⌊cf.  
Lanman, JAOS. xix. 2d half, p. 151 f.⌋, *śālūka* as that of *utpala* (a  
*Nymphaea*), *śaphaka* as a hoof (*śapha*)-shaped water-plant, and  
*mulālī* as = *mṛṇālī*. *śaphaka* occurs also at ĀpśS. ix. 14. 14, where  
it seems to signify an edible plant or fruit, perhaps a water-nut. Ppp.  
differs widely from our text: it begins *eṣa yajño vitato bahiṣṭho  
viṣṭāra pakvo div-*; it omits **c** and **d**; for **e** and **f** it  
has our 7 **a, b** ⌊with variants: see under 7⌋; then follow our **e**  
and **f** (**g**, *upa...samantāḥ*, is wanting), with variants: *etās  
tvā kulyā upa yanti viśvahā*, and *svadhayā* for *madhumat*. But our  
**c** and **d** are found further on as parts of vs. 7, with  
*puṇḍarīkam* for *āṇḍīkam*, and *śālūkham* and *śapakhas*. It is  
doubtless by an oversight that SPP. has in **b**, in both *saṁhitā* and  
*pada*, the false accent *divám* (but our O. also gives it). The verse  
lacks one syllable of being a full *kṛti* (80 syllables). The comm. ends  
vs. 5 with *mulālī́*, and begins vs. 6 with the following refrain.

Strongest is this, performed, of sacrifices: he hath reached heaven who hath prepared Vishtari. The oval-fruited lotus spreads his fibre: there bloom the nelo- phar and water-lilies. Abundant with their overflow of sweetness, these streams shall reach thee in the world of Svarga, whole lakes with lotus- blossom shall approach thee.
