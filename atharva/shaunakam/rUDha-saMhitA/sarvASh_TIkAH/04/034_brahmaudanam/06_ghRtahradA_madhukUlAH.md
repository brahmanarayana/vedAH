### Translation
6. Having pools of ghee, having slopes of honey, having strong drink  
(*súrā*) for water, filled with milk (*kṣīrá*), with water, with  
curds—let all these etc. etc.

### Notes
Ppp. agrees in **a, b** with our text (we should expect rather  
*madhukulyās*); but for the refrain it has *etās tvāṁ talpā upa yanti  
viśvatas svarge loke svadhayā mādayantīḥ* (the remaining pāda again  
wanting, as in vs. 5). The refrain appears much more in place with this  
verse than in vs. 5. The comm., as already indicated, makes its vs. 6 of  
our 6 **a, b**, preceded by the refrain of vs. 5; the refrain of our vs.  
6 it omits altogether. The *súrā* seems most probably to have been a  
kind of beer or ale ⌊so Roth: not distilled liquor, as Zimmer, p. 280,  
suggests⌋. A full *atiśakvarī* (60) calls for two more syllables.
