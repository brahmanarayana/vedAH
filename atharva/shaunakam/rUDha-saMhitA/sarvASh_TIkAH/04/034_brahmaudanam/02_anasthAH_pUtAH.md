### Translation
2. Boneless, purified, cleansed with the purifier, bright (*śúci*), they  
go to a bright world; Jātavedas burns not away their virile member; in  
the heavenly (*svargá*) world much women-folk is theirs.

### Notes
Ppp. makes *pūtās* and *śuddhās* exchange places in **a**; and there is  
confusion in its text. The comm. explains *anasthās* by *na vidyate  
asthyupalakṣitaṁ ṣāṭkāuśikaṁ śarīram eṣām*, and *strāiṇam* by *strīṇām  
samūho bhogārtham;* the "they" are the performers of the *sava*  
sacrifice. The Anukr. does not notice the redundancy of a syllable in  
**c**. ⌊There should be a space between *prá* and *dahati*.—Regarding  
sensual pleasures in heaven, see Muir's note. l.c.; Zimmer, p. 413;  
Lanman, *Skt. Reader*, p. 379 end, 380; and Weber's note; cf. also AB.  
i. 22¹⁴.⌋

Boneless, cleansed, purified by him who cleanseth, they go res- plendent to the world of splendour. Fire burneth not their organ of enjoyment: much pleasure have they in the world of Svarga.
