### Translation
4. Whoso cook the *viṣṭārín* rice-mess, them Yama robs not of their  
seed; becoming chariot-owner, \[such a one\] goes about upon a  
chariot-road; becoming winged, he goes all across the skies.

### Notes
Ppp. has in **c** *rathāyān īyate*. ⌊In the metrical definition, the  
Anukr. seems confused here; but vs. 4 appears to be intended.⌋

Yama robs not of generative vigour the men who dress oblation called Vishtari. Borne on his car, a charioteer, he travels: endowed with wings he soars beyond the heavens.
