### Translation
7. This that scorches (*abhi-śuc*) me, or by whomsoever done, from what  
is human, not divine—I praise heaven-and-earth, \[as\] a suppliant I  
call loudly on \[them\]: do ye free us from distress.

### Notes
The verse looks as if broken off in the middle, to allow addition of the  
regular close. Ppp. has at end of **b** the more manageable reading  
*pāuruṣeyaṁ na dāivyam*. TS.MS. have the second half-verse added to our  
1 **b, c**; but they have also our 7 **a, b** (in the form *yád idám mā  
’bhiśócati pāúruṣeyeṇa dāívyena*) as first half of a similar verse to  
"all the gods." The comm. understands *pāpāt* as to be supplied in  
**b**, and takes *na* as the particle of comparison.

The grief that pains me here, whoever caused it, not sent by fate, hath sprung from human action. I, suppliant, praise Heaven, Earth, and oft invoke them. Deliver us, ye twain, from grief and trouble.
