### Translation
6. Ye who gratify with sweet drink (*kīlā́la*), who with ghee; without  
whom \[men\] can \[do\] nothing whatever: O heaven- etc. etc.

### Notes
All the *pada*-mss. make in **b** the absurd division *śaknu॰vánti*, as  
if the word were a neut. pl. from the stem *śaknuvánt*. Ppp. has in  
**a** *kīlālāis*. The comm. interprets *kīlāla* simply as *anna*.

Ye who delight in nectar and in fatness, ye without whom men have no strength or power, To me, O Heaven and Earth, be ye auspicious. Deliver us, ye twain, from grief and trouble.
