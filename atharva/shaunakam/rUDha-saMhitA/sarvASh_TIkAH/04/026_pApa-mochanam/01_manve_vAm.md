### Translation
1. I reverence you, O heaven-and-earth, ye well-nourishing ones  
(*subhójas*), who, like-minded (*sácetas*) did spread out unmeasured  
intervals (*yójana*); since ye became foundations (*pratiṣṭhā́*) of good  
things, do ye free us from distress.

### Notes
Ppp. omits the intrusive and meter-disturbing *sácetasāu* (which, on  
account of its accent, is reckoned to **b** in the translation, as it  
is also by the *pada*-text); and, against rule, it combines in **b** *ye  
‘prath-*. The comm., with one of SPP's mss., reads *aprathetām;* and  
TS.MS. have the same, followed by *ámitebhir ójobhir yé pratiṣṭhé  
ábhavatāṁ vásūnām:* they have of the verse only these two pādas, used as  
part of a closing verse. The first half-verse is found also in the  
Nāigeya-*kāṇḍa* of SV. (i. 623 **a, b**): this reads *mánye* for  
*manvé*, accents *subhójasāu*, omits (like Ppp.) *sácetasāu*, and ends  
with *ámitam abhi yójanam;* its second half-verse is our 2 **c, d**.

O Heaven and Earth, I think on you, wise, givers of abundant gifts, ye who through measureless expanses have spread forth. For ye are seats and homes of goodly treasures. Deliver us, ye twain from grief and trouble.
