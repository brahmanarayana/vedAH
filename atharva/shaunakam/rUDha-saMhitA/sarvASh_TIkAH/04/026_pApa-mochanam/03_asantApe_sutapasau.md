### Translation
3. I call upon the not-distressing, of excellent penance, wide,  
profound, to be reverenced by poets: O heaven- etc. etc.

### Notes
Possibly an antithesis is intended between the first two (doubtfully  
translated) epithets, both founded on *tap* 'heat.' Ppp. has the better  
reading *vām* for *aham* at end of **a**.

I call on you who warm and cause no sorrow, deep, spacious, meet to be adored by poets. To me, O Heaven and Earth, be ye auspicious. Deliver us, ye twain, from grief and trouble.
