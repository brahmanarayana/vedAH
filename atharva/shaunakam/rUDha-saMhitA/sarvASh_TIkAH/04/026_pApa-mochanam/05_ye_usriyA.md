### Translation
5. Ye who bear the ruddy \[kine\], who the forest-trees; ye within whom  
\[are\] all beings: O heaven- etc. etc.

### Notes
One or two of our mss. (H.I.), as the majority of SPP's, make at the  
beginning the false combination *yá usr-*. The comm. declares *usriya* a  
*gonāman*.

Ye by whom cows and forest trees are cherished within whose range all creatures are included, To me, O Heaven and Earth, be ye auspicious. Deliver us, ye twain, from grief and trouble.
