### Translation
2. Up, the dawn; up, too, the sun; up, these words (*vácas*) of mine;  
up be Prajāpati stirring, the bull, with vigorous (*vājín*) energy  
(*śúṣma*).

### Notes
Ppp. has a different **b**, *uc chuṣmā oṣadhīnām* (compare our vs. 4  
**a**); and it has at the end of **d** *vājinām;* it also inserts  
between our 1 and 2 this verse: *vṛṇas te khanatāro vṛṣā tvā paśy oṣadhe  
vṛṣā ’si vṛṣṇyāvatī vṛṣaṇe tvā khanāmasi;* and this is a verse given in  
full by Kāuś. (40. 14) after the pratīka of vs. 1 of our hymn (with the  
corrections *vṛṣaṇas* and *khani-* in **a** and *-vṛṣā tvam asy* in  
**b**, and the vocative *-vati* in **c**). The editor of Kāuś. fails to  
understand and divide rightly the material, and so does not recognize  
the quotation of this hymn. The first two pādas of the added verse are  
as it were the reverse of our iv. 6. 8 **a, b**, which see.

Let Ushas and let Surya rise, let this the speech I utter rise. Let the strong male Prajapati arise with manly energy.
