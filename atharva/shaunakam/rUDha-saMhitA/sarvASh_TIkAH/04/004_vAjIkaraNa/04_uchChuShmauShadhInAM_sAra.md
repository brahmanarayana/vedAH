### Translation
4. Up, the energies (*śúṣma*) of herbs, the essences (*sā́ra*) of bulls;  
the virility (*vṛ́ṣṇya*) of men (*púṁs*) do thou put together in him, O  
Indra, self-controller.

### Notes
The corruption of **a, b** is evidenced by both meter and sense;  
probably we should read *úc chúṣmā* (i.e. *-mās;* Ppp. has this reading  
in 2 **b**) *óṣadhīnām út sā́rā ṛṣabhā́nām* (read *-ṇa-ām*); both editions  
follow the mss. (p. *śúṣma* and *sā́rā*). The Prāt. takes no notice of  
the passage. The comm. has at beginning of **c** the unmanageable  
reading *sampūṣām* (deriving it from root *puṣ* "*puṣṭāu*"), and at the  
end *tanūvaśam;* and in each case he is supported by one or more of  
SPP's mss. He takes *śúṣmā* and *sā́rā* as adjectives fem., qualifying  
*iyám óṣadhis* of 3 **d**. In our text, the accent-mark under the *-ṣa-*  
in **b** has slipped out of place to the left. The Anukr. scans 12: 8 +  
8 = 28 syllables.

Sursum (estote) herbarum vires, taurorum vigor. Tu, Indra, corporis potens, virorum masculum robur in hoc homine depone.
