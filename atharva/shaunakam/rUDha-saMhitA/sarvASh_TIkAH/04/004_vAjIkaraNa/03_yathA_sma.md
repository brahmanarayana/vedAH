### Translation
3. As forsooth of thee growing up (? *vi-ruh*) it breathes as if heated  
(? *abhi-tap*)—more full of energy than that let this herb make for  
thee.

### Notes
Altogether obscure, and probably corrupt. No variant is reported from  
Ppp., which, however, inserts *ūrdhvasrāṇim idaṁ kṛdhi* at the  
beginning, before *yathā*. The comm. is unusually curt, attempting no  
real explanation of the verse: he reads *virohitas* instead of *-hat-*,  
and paraphrases by *putrapāutrādirūpeṇa virohaṇasya nimittam  
puṁvyañjanam;* *abhitaptam* he glosses by *phaṇyan̄gam*, and *anati* by  
*ceṣṭate;* he makes *tatas* mean "so," as correlative to *yathā*,  
supplies *puṁvyañjana* as object of *kṛṇotu*, and regards the  
*vīryakāma* person as addressed throughout. ⌊Bloomfield discusses  
*śuṣma*, ZDMG. xlviii. 573, and cites it from TB. i. 6. 2⁴ as referring  
to Prajāpati's sexual force.—For *viróhatas*, see BR. vi. 418, and  
Bloomfield's note.—With *ánati*, cf. *śvasihí*, vi. l01. 1.⌋
