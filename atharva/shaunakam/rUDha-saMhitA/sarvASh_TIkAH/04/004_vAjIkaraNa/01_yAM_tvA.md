### Translation
1. Thee that the Gandharva dug for Varuṇa whose virility (? *-bhráj*)  
was dead, thee here do we dig, a penis-erecting herb.

### Notes
The meaning of *bhráj* ⌊cf. vii. 90. 2⌋ has to be inferred from the  
connection; the comm. paraphrases by *naṣṭávīrya*. The plant intended he  
declares to be "that called *kapitthaka*" (*Feronia elephantum*). The  
*pada*-reading of the last word is *śepaḥ॰hárṣaṇīm*, and Prāt. ii. 56  
prescribes the loss of the *visarga* of *śepaḥ* in *saṁhitā;* the  
comment to Prāt. iv. 75 gives the reading thus: *śepoharṣaṇīm iti  
śepaḥ॰harṣaṇīm;* and one of our *pada*-mss. presents it in the same  
form, adding *kramakāle* 'this is the *krama*-reading'; and the comm.  
has *śepoha-;* but Ppp., *śepaharṣiṇī*. As *śépa* is as genuine and old  
a form as *śépas*, there seems to be no good reason for the peculiar  
treatment of the compound.
