### Translation
5. Of the waters the first-born sap, likewise of the forest-trees; also  
Soma's brother art thou; also virility art thou of the stag.

### Notes
Ppp. has in **a** *rasāu ’ṣadhīnām*, and in **d** *āriṣyam* for *ārśám:*  
which should have been emended in both editions to the evidently true  
reading *ārśyám;* it is another case (as in 7 **c**) of the loss of *y*  
after *ś*. The comm. evidently reads *ārṣam* (the word itself is lost  
out of the text of his exposition), and he explains it as "belonging to  
the seers, Angiras etc."!
