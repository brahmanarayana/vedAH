### Translation
5. The kine \[are\] Bhaga; Indra has seemed to me the kine; the kine  
\[are\] the draught of first soma; these kine—that, O people, \[is\]  
Indra; with whatever heart \[and\] mind I seek Indra.

### Notes
The translation implies in **a** the RV. reading *achān*, of which our  
*ichāt* seems merely an unintelligent and unintelligible corruption; TB.  
has instead *acchāt*, and our O.K. give the same. Both the other texts  
add *íd* after *ichā́mi* in **d**. The comm. translates in **a** "may  
Indra desire that there be kine for me." ⌊The latter part of **c** is of  
course the well-known refrain of RV. ii. 12.⌋

To me the Cows seem Bhaga, they seem Indra, they seem a portion of the first poured Soma. These present Cows, they, O ye men, are Indra. I long for Indra with my heart and spirit.
