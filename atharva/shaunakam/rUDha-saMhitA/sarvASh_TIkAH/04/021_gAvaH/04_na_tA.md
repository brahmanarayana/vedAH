### Translation
4. No dust-raising horseman (? *árvan*) reaches them; not unto the  
slaughter-house (?) do they go; those kine of that sacrificing mortal  
roam over wide-going fearlessness.

### Notes
RV. differs only by retaining the *a* of *aśnute* in **a**, as do one or  
two of our mss. (O.K.) and half of SPP's; and its *pada*-text divides  
*saṁskṛta॰tra* in **b**, while the AV. *pada*-mss. (except our Op.)  
leave the word undivided (by an oversight, the AV. *Index Verborum*  
gives the RV. form). The comm. explains *arvā* by *hiṅsako vyāghrādiḥ*,  
and *-kakāṭa* by *udbhedaka;* also *saṁskṛtatra* by *māṅsapācaka*  
(because *viśasitaṁ trāyate pālayati*), quoting from an unknown source  
the line *saṁskṛtaḥ syād viśasitaḥ saṁskṛtatraś ca pācakaḥ*. The comment  
to Prāt. ⌊iv. 58⌋ makes the word come from the root *kṛ*. TB. ⌊also  
retains the *a* of *aśnute* and it⌋ has in **d** *mártyasya*. In our  
printed text, the upper accent-mark in *reṇúkakāṭo* is over the wrong  
*k*.

The charger with his dusty brow o'ertakes them not, and never to the shambles do they take their way. These Cows, the cattle of the pious worshipper, roam over wide- spread pasture where no danger is.
