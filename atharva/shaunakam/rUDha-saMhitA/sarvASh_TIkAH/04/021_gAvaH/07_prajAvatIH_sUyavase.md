### Translation
7. Rich in progeny, shining in good pasture, drinking clear waters at a  
good watering-place—let not the thief master you, nor the evil-plotter;  
let Rudra's weapon avoid you.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
The translation of **a** follows our text, though the false accent  
*ruśántīs* (TB. has the same reading) shows that the word is only a  
corruption of the RV. reading *riśántīs* 'cropping, grazing.' The comm.,  
though reading *ruśantīs*, renders it *tṛṇam bhakṣayantīs*. ⌊The TB.  
comm. in both ed's reads *riśantīs*.⌋ Both the other texts have in **a**  
*sūyávasam*, and at the end *hetī́ rudrásya vṛjyāḥ* (TB. *vṛñjyāt*). With  
our **c, d** compare also TS. i. 1. 1 (differing only in the order of  
words in **d** ⌊*rudrásya hetíḥ pári vo vṛṇaktu*, which is metrically  
much better than our AV. order, albeit the RV. order is as good as that  
of TS. if we pronounce *rudṛ-ásya*⌋). The comm. supplies to *aghaśaṅsas*  
in **c** *vyāghrādir duṣṭamṛgaḥ*. ⌊For *īśata*, see *Skt. Gram.* §615.⌋
