### Translation
1. The kine have come, and have done what is excellent; let them stay  
(*sad*) in the stall (*goṣṭhá*); let them take pleasure with us; may  
they be rich in progeny here, many-formed, milking for Indra many dawns.

### Notes
The other texts have no variants for this verse. The comm., after his  
wont, turns the two aorists in **a** into imperatives; he renders  
*raṇayantu* alternatively by *ramayantu* and *ramantām;* and he takes  
"dawns" as equivalent to "days" (*divasān*). ⌊'Full many a morning  
yielding milk for Indra.'⌋

The kine have come and brought good fortune: let them rest in the cow-pen and be happy near us. Here let them stay prolific, many-coloured, and yield through many morns their milk for Indra.
