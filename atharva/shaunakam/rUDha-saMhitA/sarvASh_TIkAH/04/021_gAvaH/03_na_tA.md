### Translation
3. They shall not be lost; no thief shall harm \[them\]; no hostile  
\[person\] shall dare attack their track (?); with whom he both  
sacrifices to the gods and gives, long verily with them does the  
kine-lord go in company.

### Notes
Both the other texts\* accent *vyáthis* in **b**, as does one of our  
mss. (O.), and one of SPP's. Before this word TB. has *nāí ’nā amitró*.  
The comm. explains *vyathis* as *vyathājanakam āyudham*. The pāda is  
very obscure as it stands. ⌊An earlier draft of the translator's ms.  
reads: "*Naśanti*, by its association, and its difference from  
*naśyanti*, must be meant as subjunctive (aor.), notwithstanding its  
ending." I am tempted to suggest *ná tā́ naśan; tā́* (acc. pl. fem.) *ná  
dabhāti táskaras.*—BR., vi. 1438, take *vyáthis* as 'unbemerkt von,'  
with genitive, *āsām*. But see Geldner's discussion of the combinations  
of *vyáthis* with *ā-dhṛṣ*, *Ved. Stud.* ii. 29.—Note that TB's *ămitró*  
(both ed's read so in the text and both have *ă-* in the comm.) is  
neither *amítro* nor *āmitró*. \*⌊In TB., the *pratīkas* of vss. 3 and 4  
stand in RV. order at ii. 8. 8¹¹; but the vss. are given in full at ii.  
4. 6⁹.⌋

These are ne'er lost, no robber ever injures them: no evil-minded foe attempts to harass them. The master of the kine lives a long life with these, the Cows whereby he pours his gifts and serves the Gods.
