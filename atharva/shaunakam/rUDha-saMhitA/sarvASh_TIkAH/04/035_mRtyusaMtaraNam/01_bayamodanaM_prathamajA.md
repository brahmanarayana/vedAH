### Translation
1. The rice-mess which Prajāpati, first-born of righteousness, cooked  
with fervor (*tápas*) for Brahmán; which, separator of the worlds, shall  
not harm (?)—by that rice-mess let me overpass death.

### Notes
For the obscure and questionable *nā́ ’bhiréṣāt* in **c** (no tense-stem  
*réṣa* occurs elsewhere in AV.) the comm. reads *nābhir ekā;* Ludwig,  
ignoring accent and *pada*-text (*ná: abhi॰réṣāt*), understands  
*nābhi-reṣāt* "breach of the navel"; two of our mss. (O.Op.) read  
*nā́bhiréṣāṁ* ⌊and Weber conjectured *nā́bhir eṣām*⌋. The refrain is found  
also as concluding pāda of a verse in ĀpśS. iv. 11. 3. The Anukr. does  
not note that **b** is *jagatī*.
