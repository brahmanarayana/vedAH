### Comment
Not found in Pāipp. Used by Kāuś. (66. 11) in the sava sacrifices, with a sava for escaping death (atimṛtyu) and, according to the comm., also in the ceremony of expiation for the birth of twin calves (109. 1; he reads yam odanam iti, instead of yamāu janayati, which the edition has). *⌊The Berlin Anukr. reads ātimārcyam.⌋


### Translations
Translated: Ludwig, p. 438; Griffith, i. 177; Weber, xviii. 139.
