### Translation
2. Of whom are numbered the widths of the earth; by whom the welkin  
(*rájas*) is made fast (*yup*) in the atmosphere; whose progress no one  
soever has reached (*anu-aś*)—do ye free us from distress.

### Notes
Ppp. has in **a** *varimāṇi pārthivā*, which improves the meter; also  
*gusthitām* for *yupitam* in **b**, and *prayām* for *prāyam* in **c**.  
*Yupitám* (perhaps 'smoothed out, spread uniformly' ⌊cf. Bloomfield AJP.  
xii. 418, 419⌋) the comm. explains by *mūrchitaṁ sad dhāryate*. The  
*pada*-text divides in **c** *pra॰āyám*, for which SPP., on the  
authority of only one of his mss., unaccountably substitutes *pra॰ayám*  
(a number of our mss. give instead *-yán*) ⌊cf. BR. v. 1635⌋.

Ye who have counted up the earth's expanses, and in the sky smoothed out the air's mid-region, Whose going-forth hath ne'er been reached by any, deliver us, ye two, from grief and trouble.
