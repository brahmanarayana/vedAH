### Translation
3. In \[conformity with\] thy course (*vratá*) people (*jána*) go to  
rest; when thou art risen, they go forth, O thou of beauteous luster;  
ye, O Vāyu and Savitar, defend beings—do ye free us from distress.

### Notes
Ppp. has *yachatas* for *rakṣathas* at end of **c**; the comm., with a  
couple of SPP's mss., reads *rakṣatas;* and he paraphrases it, without a  
word of remark, with *pālayathas*.

Beauteously bright! men rest in thy dominion when thou hast risen up and hastened onward. Ye, Vayu, Savitar, preserve all creatures. Deliver us, ye, twain, from grief and trouble.
