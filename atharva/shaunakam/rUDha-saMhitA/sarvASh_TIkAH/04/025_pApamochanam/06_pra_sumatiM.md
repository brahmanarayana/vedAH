### Translation
6. O Savitar, Vāyu, \[give\] forth favor in order to aid; ye cause to  
revel in the intoxicating jovial \[soma\]; hitherward from the height  
(*pravát*) confirm ye of what is pleasant (*vāmá*); do ye free us from  
distress.

### Notes
The strong ellipses in the first half-verse are filled by the comm. in  
accordance with the translation. Ppp. reads in **b** *mādayetām*, and in  
**c** *pravatā ni yachatas*. The comm. makes *pravátas* (=  
*prakarṣavatas*) coördinate with *vāmásya*, qualifying *dhanasya*  
understood. ⌊Pischel, *Ved. Stud.* ii. 74, takes it as acc. pl. with  
*vāmasya*, 'streams of *vāma*,' and compares *rāyó dhā́rā, vásvo arṇavá*,  
etc.—Render the subjunctive in **b** by 'cause ye' etc.?⌋

Ye, Savitar and Vayu, to assist us, enjoy the hymn and the delightful cheerer. Come hither downward from the stream of blessing. Deliver us, ye twain, from grief and trouble.
