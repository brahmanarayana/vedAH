### Translation
5. Let Savitar and Vāyu engender (*ā-sū*) in my body (*tanū́*) wealth,  
prosperity, very propitious dexterity; do ye put here freedom from  
*yákṣma*, greatness; do ye free us from distress.

### Notes
*Tanū́* in **b** is translated as a locative because so regarded by the  
Prāt. (under i. 74), as it is also by the comm. (= *tanvām, asmadīye  
śarīre*); it might be nom. dual; or, yet better, it might be emended to  
*tanūdakṣám*. Ppp. reads *aveyakṣmatāṁ suhasmāsu dhattam* for **c**. The  
comm. paraphrases *ā́ suvatām* with *prerayatām prayacchatām*.

Of their own selves let Savitar and Vayu send favourable strength and wealth and plenty. Here give us perfect freedom from consumption. Deliver us, ye twain, from grief and trouble.
