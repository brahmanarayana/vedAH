### Translation
1. Of Vāyu, of Savitar we reverence the counsels (*vidátha*): ye who  
enter and who defend what has life (*ātmanvánt*); ye who have become  
encompassers of the all—do ye free us from distress.

### Notes
TS. and MS. read *bibhṛtás* (for *viśáthas*) and *rákṣatas* in **b**,  
and TS. *babhūvátus* in **c**; and both have *ā́gasas* in the refrain.  
MS. further combines *yā́ āt-* in **b**, and has *tā́ no m-* in the  
refrain. The comm. is uncertain as to the sense of *vidátha*. ⌊Geldner  
renders, "Wir gedenken des Bundes zwischen V. und S.," ZDMG. lii. 746:  
cf. Foy, KZ. xxxiv. 226.⌋ Doubtless it is a metrical consideration that  
causes the change from 3d to 2d person in the refrain of hymns 25, 26,  
and 28. ⌊Grammar and meter favor restoration of the older and longer  
form *paribhúvā* in **c**—see Lanman, JAOS. x. 413.⌋

I think on Vayu's and Savitar's holy rites, ye twain who penetrate and guard the living world: Ye who have come to be this All's pervaders, deliver us, ye two from grief and trouble.
