### Translation
4. Away from here, O Vāyu and Savitar, drive (*sidh*) ye what is  
ill-done, away the demons and śimidā; for ye unite (*sam-sṛj*) \[men\]  
with refreshment (*ūrjā́*), with strength—do ye free us from distress.

### Notes
Nearly all the mss. read in **c** *sṛjátha* (instead of *-thas*). The  
comm., with two or three of SPP's mss., reads *samidām* (for *śímidām*)  
in his text in **b**, but explains *samidhām* (by *saṁdīpāṁ kṛtyāṁ ca*);  
*itás* in **a** he takes from root *i*, and paraphrases by *gamayathas!*  
Emendation in **a** to *duṣkṛ́tam*, 'evil-doer,' would be acceptable; the  
comm. takes it as accented (= *asmadīyam pāpam*).

Hence, Vayu, Savitar drive evil action, chase Simida away, drive off the demons. Ye give us store of energy and power. Deliver us, ye twain, from grief and trouble.
