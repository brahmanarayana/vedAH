### Translation
6. The non-existent came into being (*sam-bhū*) from the earth; that   
goes to the sky, the great expanse (*vyácas*); let that, verily, fuming  
abroad, come back thence on the maker.

### Notes
The translation implies the obvious emendation, made in our text, of  
*tád dyā́m* for *tád yā́m*, which is read by all the mss. and by the  
comm., and retained in SPP's text, though in a note he approves our  
alteration; it is only another example of mistaking an abbreviated for a  
full reading (*dy* for its grammatical equivalent *ddy*: compare ⌊i. 22.  
1, and Roth, ZDMG. xlviii. 104⌋). Ppp. reads in **b** *bṛhat vacas;* and  
it has for **c** *ud it vaco vyadhūmayat*. The comm. gives *bhūmyām* for  
*-yās* in **a**, and *tvat* for *tat* at beginning of **b**. He renders  
*asat* by *asatkalpaṁ kṛtyārūpam*, or, alternatively, by *aśobhanaṁ  
kṛtyārūpam*. The accent *-dhūpā́yat* is contrary to all rule, and  
doubtless false; MS. (i. 10. 20; p. 160. l) has *-pāyát*, which is  
correct. The general sense of the verse is obscure; but it appears to  
parallel the return of the charm upon its producer with the action of  
water in exhaling from the earth and coming back as rain.

The evil sprang from earth; it mounts to heaven and spreads to vast extent. Reverted, shaking him with might, thence on its maker let it fall.
