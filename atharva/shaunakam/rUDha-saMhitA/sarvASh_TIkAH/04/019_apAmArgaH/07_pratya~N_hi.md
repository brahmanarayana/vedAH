### Translation
7. Since thou hast come into being reverted (*pratyáñc*), having  
reverted fruit, do thou repel (*yu*) from me all curses, \[repel\] very  
far the deadly weapon.

### Notes
The verse is nearly repeated as vii. 65. i. Ppp. has for **c, d**.  
*pratīṣkṛtyā amuṁ kṛtyākṛtaṁ jahi*. The comm. reads in **b** *-phala*,  
vocative; regarding, of course, the *apāmārga* plant as addressed.

For thou hast grown reverted, and turned backward also is thy fruit. Remove all curses far from me, keep most remote the stroke of death.
