### Translation
1. Both art thou not relative-making, and now art thou kin-making; also  
do thou cut off (? *ā-chid*) the progeny of the witchcraft-maker, like a  
reed of the rainy season (*vā́rṣika*).

### Notes
Or, perhaps, 'a last year's reed' (but comm., *varṣāsu bhavam*). The  
first half-verse is very obscure, and the translation follows the text  
as closely as possible (Ppp. differs only by beginning *ute ’vā ’sy*),  
understanding *a-bandhukṛt*, and not *abandhukṛt* (which would be  
accented on *-kṛ́t*); possibly the sense is "thou makest common cause  
with some and not with others." The comm. takes *-kṛt* both times from  
*kṛt* 'cut' (which is not impossible): = *kartaka* or *chedaka;* and he  
cites RV. iv. 4. 5 "slaughter thou our foes, the related and the  
unrelated." *Naḍám* he explains as *etatsaṁjñaṁ succhedaṁ tṛṇaviśeṣam*.  
The Anukr. seems to sanction abbreviation to *’va* in **d**.

Thou breakest ties of kith and kin, thou causest, too, relation- ship: So bruise the sorcerer's offspring, like a reed that groweth in the Rains.
