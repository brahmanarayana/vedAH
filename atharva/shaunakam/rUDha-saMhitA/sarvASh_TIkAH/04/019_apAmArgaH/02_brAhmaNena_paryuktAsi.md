### Translation
2. Thou art bespoken (?) by a Brāhman, by Kaṇva son of Nṛshad; thou  
goest like a brilliant army (?); there is no fear (*bhayá*) there where  
thou arrivest (*pra-āp*), O herb.

### Notes
Ppp. has in **a** *pariyukto ‘si*, and this is very probably the true  
form of the word here used; the difficulty is that neither *yuj* nor  
*vac* is anywhere else found used with *pari;* *prayukta* ⌊'employed'⌋  
is what we should expect. We have "Kaṇva's plant" mentioned at vi. 52.  
3. The imperfect meter of **b** (which the Anukr. fails to notice, as it  
does also the like deficiency in **d**) gives a degree of plausibility  
to Grill's suggestion that the pāda is intruded on an original  
*anuṣṭubh*. The *pada*-mss. waver between *nārsadéna* and *nārṣ-* (our  
Bp. emends *ṣ* to *s*; Op. is altered obscurely; D.K. have *s*), but *s*  
is certainly the true reading, as required by Prāt. iv. 83; SPP. has  
wrongly chosen *ṣ* for his *pada*-text. The comm., with a couple of  
SPP's authorities that follow him, reads *tvíṣīmate* in **c** (our  
P.M.W.E. have *tvíṣimatī*.) The mss., without any statable reason,  
accent *ásti* in **d**, and our edition follows them; SPP. strangely  
gives *ásti* in *saṁhitā-*, but *asti* in *pada*-text. ⌊Are not  
*páryuktā* and *pariyuktā* alike awkward phonetic renderings of  
*prá-yuktā?* Cf. Ppp. *śaśire* (= *śaśṛ-é*), iv. 18. 6; and *dadhire* (=  
*dadhre*, Roth, ZDMG. xlviii. 116).⌋

Thou hast been blessed with blessing by the Brahman, Kanva Narshada. Thou fliest like a flashing dart: there is no fear or danger, Plant! within the limit of thy range.
