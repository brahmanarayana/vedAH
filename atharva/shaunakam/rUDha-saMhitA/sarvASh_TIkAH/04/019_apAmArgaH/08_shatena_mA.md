### Translation
8. Protect me around with a hundred; defend me with a thousand; may the  
forceful (*ugrá*) Indra, O lord of the plants, assign force (*ojmán*)  
unto thee.

### Notes
Ppp. has for **d** *bhadro ’jmānam ā dadhuḥ*. It can hardly be that the  
writer does not use here *ugrá* and *ojmán* as words felt to be related;  
but the comm. gives for the former his standing and always repeated  
*udgūrṇabala*, and paraphrases the other with *ojasvitva*.
