### Translation
5. As of the powerful Agni the lusters (*bhānú*) go forth in every  
direction—gleaming away our evil.

### Notes
These four verses are (rejecting the intrusive refrain) one connected  
sentence: the *prá*'s in vss. 3 and 4 repeat by anticipation the  
*jā́yemahi prá* of vs. 4 **b**; "we" are, in fact, Agni's *sūri*'s, since  
we depute him to sacrifice for us, just as our *sūri*'s procure us, the  
priests; and our progeny is to increase and spread like the brightness  
of the fire. TA. spoils the connection by putting vs. 5 before vs. 4;  
and the sense, by reading *sūráyas* for *bhānávas* in 5 **b**. Ppp. has  
*jāyemahe* in 4 **b**. One of our *pada*-mss. (Op.) agrees with the RV.  
*pada*-text in dividing *sugātu॰yā́* in 2 **a** (the rest read  
*su॰gātuyā́*).

As ever conquering Agni's beams of splendour go to every side, His lustre flash our pain away.
