### Translation
1. Gleaming (*śuc*) away our evil (*aghá*), O Agni, gleam thou wealth  
unto \[us\]: gleaming away our evil.

### Notes
This first verse is found a second time in TA. (vi. 10. i). The refrain  
is a mechanical repetition of 1 **a**, having no connection of meaning  
with any of the verses. The comm. explains *ápa śóśucat* by *naśyatu*,  
and *ā́ śuśugdhi* by *samṛddhaṁ kuru.* ⌊TA. reads *śuśudhyā́* in both  
places in both editions.⌋
