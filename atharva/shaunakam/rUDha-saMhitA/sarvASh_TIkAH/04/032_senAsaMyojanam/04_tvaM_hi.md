### Translation
4. Since thou, O fury, art of overcoming force, self-existent, terrible,  
overpowering hostile plotters, belonging to all men (*-carṣaṇí*),  
powerful, very powerful—do thou put in us force in fights.

### Notes
RV. has *sáhāvān* for *sáhīyān* in **c**. MS. (iv. 12. 3) gives  
*svayaṁjás* in **b**, and *sáhāvān* in **c**; and for **d** it has *sá  
hūyámāno amṛ́tāya gachat.*
