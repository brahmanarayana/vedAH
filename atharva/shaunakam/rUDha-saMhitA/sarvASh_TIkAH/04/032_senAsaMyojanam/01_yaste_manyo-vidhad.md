### Translation
1. He who hath worshiped thee, O fury, missile thunderbolt, gains  
(*puṣ*) power, force, everything, in succession; may we, with thee as  
ally, that art made of power, overpower the barbarian, the Aryan, with  
powerful power.

### Notes
Ppp. has *sadyo* for *manyo* in **a**, and *sahīyasā* at the end. All  
the mss. accent *púṣyati* in **b**, and SPP. very properly so reads; our  
text was altered to conform with RV., which in general is distinctly  
less apt to give accent to a verb in such a position ⌊*Skt. Gram.* §597  
a⌋. RV. also omits the redundant and meter-disturbing (the Anukr. takes  
no notice of this) *vayám* in **c**. Several of our mss. (P.M.W.E.) give  
*vidadhat* instead of *‘vidhat* in **a**. *Sāhyā́ma* (p. *sahyā́ma*) is  
expressly prescribed by Prāt. iii. 15, iv. 88; the comm. appears to read  
*sahy-*. The comm. renders *ānuṣak* by *anuṣaktaṁ saṁtatam*. ⌊For *vajra  
sāyaka*, see note to iv. 31. 6; and for *púṣyati*, note to iv. 13. 2.⌋
