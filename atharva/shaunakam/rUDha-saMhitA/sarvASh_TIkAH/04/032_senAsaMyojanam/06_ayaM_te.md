### Translation
6. Here I am for thee; come hitherward unto us, meeting (*pratīcīná*)  
\[us\], O powerful, all-giving one; O thunderbolt-bearing fury, turn  
hither to us; let us (two) slay the barbarians; and do thou know thy  
partner (*āpí*).

### Notes
RV. keeps better consistency by reading *mā* for *nas* in **a**, and  
*mā́m* for *nas* in **c**; at the end of **b** it has *viśvadhāyas*. In  
**a** Ppp. has *mā*, like RV.; in **c** it reads *upa nas*, combining to  
*na ”vav-*. The comm. supplies *śatrūn* as object of *pratīcīnas*, and  
paraphrases the end of the verse with *api ca bandhubhūtam mām  
budhyasva.*

Come hither, I am all thine own: advancing, turn thou to me, victorious, all-bestowing. Come to me, Manyu, wielder of the thunder: bethink thee of thy friend, and slay the Dasyus.
