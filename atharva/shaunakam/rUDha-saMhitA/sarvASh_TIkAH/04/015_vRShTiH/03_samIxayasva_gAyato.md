### Translation
3. Do thou make the singers (*gā́yant*) to behold together the mists;  
let rushes (*véga*) of waters rush (*vij*) up here and there; let  
gushes of rain gladden the earth; let plants of all forms be born here  
and there.

### Notes
Ppp. has for **a** *samikṣad viśvag vāto napāṅsy;* at end of **b**,  
*patantu* for *vijantām;* in **d**, *oṣadhayas* (as in 2 **d** ⌊of the  
editions⌋). The comm. regards **a** as addressed to the Maruts (*he  
marudgaṇa*), and "the singing ones" as "us who are praising"; and *vega*  
as "swift stream." The Anukr. ignores the extra syllable in **d**  
⌊rectify as in 2 **d**, *vírūpās?*⌋.

Cause us who sing to see the gathering vapours: out burst in many a place the rush of waters! Let floods of rain refresh the ground with gladness; and herbs spring various with each form and colour.
