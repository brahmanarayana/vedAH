### Translation
7. Let the liberal ones favor (*sam-av*) you, also the fountains, great  
serpents (*ajagará*); let the clouds, started forward by the Maruts,  
rain along the earth.

### Notes
Ppp. omits *vas* in **a**, and combines *sudānavo ’tsā ’jagarā;* and its  
second half-verse is *vātā varṣasya varṣatuṣ pravahantu pṛthivīm anu*.  
The comm. renders *avantu* by *tarpayantu;* *ajagarās* here by  
*ajagarātmanā vitarkyamānāḥ*, and under vs. 9 by *ajagarasamānākārāḥ:*  
i.e. "that look like great serpents as they wind sinuously along"; he  
takes *sudānavas* in **a** alternatively as vocative, notwithstanding  
its accent.
