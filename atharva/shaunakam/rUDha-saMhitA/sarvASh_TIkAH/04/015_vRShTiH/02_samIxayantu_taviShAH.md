### Translation
2. Let the mighty (*taviṣá*), liberal (*sudā́nu*) ones cause to behold  
together; let the juices (*rása*) of the waters attach themselves  
(*sac*) to the herbs; let gushes (*sárga*) of rain gladden (*mahay-*)  
the earth; let herbs of all forms be born here and there (*pṛ́thak*).

### Notes
The "mighty ones" in **a** are doubtless the Maruts; *īkṣay-* is perhaps  
an error which has blundered in from the next verse, for *ukṣay-*  
(though no causative of *ukṣ* occurs elsewhere in AV.); the comm.  
supplies for it *vṛṣṭim* as object; the translation implies something  
like "attract every one's attention." It would be easy to rectify the  
meter of **d** by reading *óṣadhīr vírūpaḥ;* **a** is the only real  
*jagatī* pāda; and even by count the verse is only *nicṛt* (12 + 11: 11  
+ 13 = 47).

Let them show forth, the strong, the bounteous Maruts: let plants and shrubs be hung with drops of moisture. Let floods of rain refresh the ground with gladness and herbs spring various with each form and colour.
