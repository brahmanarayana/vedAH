### Comment
Found (except vss. 2 and 15) in Pāipp. v. (in the verse-order 1, 3, 6, 5, 4, 7, 9, 10, 8, 11-14, 16). This hymn and vii. 18 appear to be called mārutāni in Kāuś. (26. 24: see note to this rule); they are specified as used together in a rite for procuring rain (41. 1 ff.); also in expiation of the portent of upatārakās 'inundations' (103. 3); further, vss. 10 and 11, with oblations respectively to Agni and Prajāpati, in expiation of the portent of obscuration of the seven seers (127. 8, 9). In Vāit. (8. 9) vs. 6 appears in the preparations of the cāturmāsya sacrifice. And the comm. quotes vs. 11 as employed by the Nakṣ. K. (18) in a mahāśanti called prājāpatī.
