### Translation
11. May Prajāpati from the sea, the ocean, sending waters, excite the  
water-holder; let the seed of the stallion (*vṛ́ṣan áśva*) be filled up;  
come hitherward with that thunder,—

### Notes
To this verse really belongs the first pāda of our vs. 12, as the sense  
plainly shows, as well as its association in RV. (v. 83. 6 **b, c, d**)  
with the two closing pādas here. ⌊Cf. Lanman, *Reader*, p. 370;  
misdivision as between hymns.⌋ But the mss., the Anukr., the comm., and  
both editions, end vs. 11 with *é ’hi*. RV. reads in our **c** *pinvata*  
for *pyāyatām*, and *dhā́rās* for *rétas*. Ppp. combines in **b** *āp’  
īrayann*, and begins **c** with *prā py-*. The comm. gives *viṣṭos*  
instead of *vṛṣṇas* in **c**, and explains both it and *salilād* in  
**a** by *vyāpanaśīla*, which is one of his standing glosses for obscure  
words; *ardayāti* he paraphrases with *raśmibhir ādānena pīḍayatu*, and  
*udadhim* simply by *jaladhim*. This verse is as much *bhurij* as vs.  
10, unless we combine *ā́pe ”ráyan* in **b**. ⌊For *-núnéhi*, see Prāt.  
iii. 38, note.⌋
