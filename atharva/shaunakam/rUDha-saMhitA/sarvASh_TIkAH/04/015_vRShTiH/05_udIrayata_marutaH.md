### Translation
5. Send up, O Maruts, from the ocean; brilliant \[is\] the song; ye make  
the mist fly up; let the lowing \[cows\] of the resounding misty great  
bull, the waters, gratify the earth.

### Notes
We had the second half-verse as 1 **c, d**; but Ppp. gives an original  
half-verse instead: *pra varṣayanti tamiṣā sudānavo ‘paṁ rasīr oṣadhī  
sacantām*. The first half is translated literally as it stands; but it  
is pretty certainly corrupt. Ppp. reads *īrayanta, tveṣā ’rkā,  
pātayantu\*;* and the true reading is perhaps *tveṣā́ arkā́ nábha út  
pātayantu* 'let our brilliant songs make' etc. The comm. finds no  
difficulty, since his ideas of grammar allow him to make *tveṣás* and  
*arkás* qualify *nábhas* (*tveṣo dīptimad arko ‘rcanasādhanam udakaṁ  
tadyuktaṁ nabhaḥ*). TS. (in ii. 4. 8²) and MS. (in ii. 4. 7) have a  
first pāda nearly agreeing with our **a** (TS. *īrayathā*, MS. *-yatā*),  
the rest of the verse being wholly different. A couple of our mss.  
(O.Op.), with two or three of SPP's, read *samudrajás* at end of **a**.  
\*⌊Roth, in his collation, gives *pātayanta;* in his notes, *-tu*.⌋

Up from the sea lift your dread might, ye Maruts: as light and splendour, send the vapour upward! Let waters satisfy the earth, the voices of the great mist-enve- loped Bull who roareth.
