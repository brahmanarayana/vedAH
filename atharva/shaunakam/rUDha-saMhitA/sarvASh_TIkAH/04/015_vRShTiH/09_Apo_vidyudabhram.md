### Translation
9. Waters, lightning, cloud, rain—let the liberal ones favor you, also  
the fountains, great serpents; let the clouds, started forward by the  
Maruts, show favor (*pra-av*) along the earth.

### Notes
Ppp. begins with *vātas* instead of *āpas*, and omits (as in 7 **a**)  
*vas* in **b**; and, for the last two pādas, it reads *prā pyāyasva pra  
pitṛsva saṁ bhūmiṁ payasā sṛja*. The comm. again takes *sudānavas* as  
vocative, and makes the elements mentioned in **a** subjects of *sam  
avantu;* in **d** he reads *plāvantu* but regards it as for *prā ’vantu*  
⌊parallel with *palāyate* etc. (W's *Gram.* §1087 c), for which he cites  
Pāṇini viii. 2. 19⌋.

May waters, lightning, cloud, and rain, boon springs and serpents tend you well. Urged by the Maruts let the clouds pour down their rain upon the earth.
