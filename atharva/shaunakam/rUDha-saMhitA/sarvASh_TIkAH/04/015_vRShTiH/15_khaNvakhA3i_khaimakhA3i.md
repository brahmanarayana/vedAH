### Translation
15. O *khaṇvakhā!* O *khāimakhā!* in the middle, O *tadurī!* win ye  
rain, O Fathers; seek the favor (*mánas*) of the Maruts.

### Notes
The verse (as already noted) is unfortunately wanting in Ppp. The first  
pāda is misprinted as regards accentuation in our edition, being marked  
as if the final syllables were *kampa*, instead of mere protractions.  
⌊That is, the horizontal under the first syllable *kha-* should be  
deleted; and the signs above and below the two *3*'s should also be  
deleted. They are printed aright, *kháṇvakā́3i khāímakhā́3i*, in *nāgarī*,  
by Whitney, Prāt. p. 392, footnote, and on p. 400, and by SPP.⌋ Prāt. i.  
105 quotes the words (with the two that follow) in its list of words  
showing protraction; and i. 96 points out that the final *i* in each is  
grave. The comm. says that the three vocatives (he quotes the stems as  
*khaṇvakhā ṣāimakhā tadurī*) are special names for kinds of  
she-frogs—which seems likely enough; the two former appear to involve  
imitations of croaking (but in LśS. iv. 3. 18 the householder's female  
slaves are to call out *hāimahā3*, as they circumambulate the  
*mārjālīya*, filling new water-holders). SPP. (p. 598, note) asks why,  
if the words are vocatives, they are not accented simply *kháṇvakhā3i  
khāí makhā3i*—being apparently ignorant of the fact that a protracted  
final syllable is regularly and usually accented, without regard to any  
other accent the word may have (see Whitney, *Skt. Gr.* §78 a). Several  
of our mss. (E.I.H.O.Op.), and a couple of SPP's, leave the first  
syllable of each word unaccented. It would much help both meter and  
sense to supply *hradásya* (or else *plavasva*) after *mádhye* in **b**;  
the comm. either supplies *hradasya* or reads it in his text. All our  
mss., and our printed text, have at the end *ichataḥ;* SPP. follows the  
comm. and about a third of his manuscript authorities in reading  
*ichata*, which is doubtless the true text, and implied as such in the  
translation above. The comm. explains *pitaras* as *pālayitāro  
maṇḍūkāḥ!* SPP. regards him as reading *mārutam* in **d**, but this  
appears doubtful. ⌊The Anukr. scans 8 + 5: 8 + 8.⌋
