### Translation
8. Let it lighten to every region (*ā́śā*); let the winds blow to  
(from?) every quarter; let the clouds, started forward by the Maruts,  
come together along the earth.

### Notes
Ppp. has in **d** *varṣantu*, as our text in the preceding verse. The  
comm. also points out the possibility of taking *diśás* as either accus.  
pl. or abl. sing. The Anukr. somehow omits to define the metrical  
character of this verse and of vs. 14.

Let lightning flash on every side: from all the regions blow the winds! Urged by the Maruts let the clouds pour down their rain upon the earth.
