### Translation
1. Let the directions, full of mist (*nábhasvant*), fly up together; let  
clouds, wind-hurried, come together; let the lowing \[cows\] of the  
resounding misty great bull, the waters, gratify the earth.

### Notes
Ppp. combines in **d** *vāśrā ”paḥ;* the comm., in **c**, *maharṣ-* ⌊as  
the meter requires⌋; this happens to be a case where all the mss. agree  
in *makaṛṣ-*. The meaning in **a** probably is the confusion of the  
directions by reason of the mists; the comm. renders *nábhasvatīs* in  
**a** by *nabhasvatā vāyunā yuktāḥ*, and *nabhasvatas* in **c** by  
*vāyupreritasya meghasya sambandhinyaḥ*. ⌊The second half-verse recurs  
at 5, below; see note.⌋

Let all the misty regions fly together, let all the rain-clouds sped by wind, assemble. Let waters satisfy the earth, the voices of the great mist-enve- loped Bull who roareth.
