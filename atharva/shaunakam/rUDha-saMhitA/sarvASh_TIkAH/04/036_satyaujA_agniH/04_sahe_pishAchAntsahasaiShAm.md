### Translation
4. I overpower the *piśācás* with power; I take to myself their  
property; I slay all the abusers; let my design be successful.

### Notes
All the mss. read in **a-b** *sáhasāiṣām*, p. *sáhasā: eṣām*, instead of  
the obviously correct *sáhasāíṣām*, p. *sáhasā: ā́: eṣām* ⌊cf. note to  
iii. 14. 3⌋: it is one of the most striking blunders of the traditional  
text. The comm. understands the true reading, and it is restored by  
emendation in our edition; SPP. abides by the mss. In **d**, the comm.  
has *śaṁ nas* for *sam me*. The Anukr., by noting no irregularity of  
meter, seems to imply *ā́ eṣām* in **b**, but his descriptions are so  
little exact that the evidence is really of no value.

I conquer the Pisachas with my power, and take their wealth away. All who would injure us I slay. Let mine intention have success.
