### Translation
1. Them let him of real force burn forth—Agni Vāiśvānara, the bull;  
whoso shall abuse and seek to harm us, likewise whoso shall play the  
niggard toward us.

### Notes
The comm. paraphrases *durasyāt* with *duṣṭān ivā ”caret: asmāsv  
avidyamānaṁ doṣam udbhāvayet*. The Prāt. (iii. 18) allows both *i* and  
*ī* in denominatives like *arātiy-*, and its comment quotes this word as  
example of the former.

Endowed with true strength, let the Bull, Agni Vaisvanara, burn them up. Him who would pain and injure us, him who would treat us as a foe.
