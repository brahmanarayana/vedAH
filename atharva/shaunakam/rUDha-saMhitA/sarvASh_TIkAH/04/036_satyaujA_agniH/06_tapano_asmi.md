### Translation
6. I am a vexer (*tápana*) of the *piśācás*, as a tiger of them that  
have kine; like dogs on seeing a lion, they do not find a hiding-place  
(*nyáñcana*).

### Notes
The comm. reads *anu* instead of *na* in **d**. The meter requires  
*‘smi* in **a**.

I trouble the Pisachas as the tiger plagues men rich in kine. They, even as dogs when they have seen a lion, find no hiding- place.
