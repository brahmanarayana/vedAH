### Translation
2. Whoso shall seek to harm us not seeking to harm, and whoso seeks to  
harm us seeking to harm—in the two tusks of Agni Vāiśvānara do I set  
him.

### Notes
All the mss. read in **a** *dípsat*, which is accordingly retained by  
SPP.; our edition emends to *dípsāt* to agree with vs. 1 **c**; the  
comm. also has *dipsāt;* and it is favored by the *śápāt* of the  
parallel expression in vi. 37. 3. With the second half-verse compare  
xvi. 7. 3.

Him who, unharmed, would injure us, and him who, harmed, would do us harm, I lay between the doubled fangs of Agni, of Vaisvanara.
