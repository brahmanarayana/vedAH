### Translation
5. The gods that hasten (*hās*) with him—they measure speed with the  
sun—with those cattle (*paśú*) that are in the streams, in the  
mountains, I am in concord.

### Notes
Doubtless corrupt in text, and incapable of yielding sense. Grill  
regards the verse as interpolated. ⌊As for *hās*, see Bergaigne, *Rel.  
Véd.* i. 200 n.⌋ The comm. guesses two wholly discordant and equally  
worthless explanations; in the first he takes *devā́s* as (from *div*  
'play') "*piśācas* and the like," and *hāsante* as for *hāsayanti*  
'cause to laugh' in the second, he understands *devās* as vocative, and  
*hāsante* as for *jihāsante* ⌊printed *jihsyante*⌋ 'seek to leave.' One  
is tempted to find *stenā́s* instead of *téna* in **a**. The deficiency  
(unnoticed by the Anukr.) of a syllable in **d** is an indication of a  
corrupt text.

With Gods who flee with him, and match their rapid motion with the Sun, I with those animals who dwell in rivers and on hills am found.
