### Translation
5. Make manifest \[thy\] forms; do not hide thyself away; then mayest  
thou, O thousand-eyed one, look upon the *kimīdíns*.

### Notes
Literally (in **d**) 'meet with thy look.' Ppp. begins **c** with *evā*  
instead of *atho*, and ends **d** with *paśyāmy āyata*. The abbreviation  
in **c** of the stem *-cakṣus* to *-cakṣu* is one of those noted in the  
Prāt. rules ii. 59 and iv. 100.

Make manifest the forms of things; hide not their essences from sight. And, thou who hast a thousand eyes, look the Kimidins in the face.
