### Translation
4. May the thousand-eyed god set it in my right hand; with it do I see  
every one, both who is śūdra and \[who\] Āryan.

### Notes
Ppp. has *hast’ ādadat* at end of **b**, and, for second half-verse,  
*tato ‘haṁ sarvaṁ paśyāmi adbhūtaṁ* (sic) *yac ca bhavyam*. *Paśyāni*  
would be an acceptable emendation in **c**. The comm. (with one of SPP's  
mss.) reads *tvayā* in **c**; he regards the "god" in **a** as Indra.

The God who hath a thousand eyes give me this Plant in my right hand! I look on every one therewith, each Sudra and each Aryan man.
