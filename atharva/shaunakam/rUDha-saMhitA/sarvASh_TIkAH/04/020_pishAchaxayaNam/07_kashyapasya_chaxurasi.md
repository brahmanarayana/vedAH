### Translation
7. The eye of Kaśyapa art thou, and of the four-eyed bitch; conceal thou  
not the *piśācá*, like the sun gliding (*sṛp*) in the clear sky  
(*vīdhrá*).

### Notes
That is, allow him to be no more concealed than the sun etc. Both  
editions read *-akṣyā́s* at end of **b**, but it is against the authority  
of the mss., all of which (save two of SPP's which follow the comm. in  
giving the true reading) omit, as in numerous other cases, the *y* after  
the sibilant. The comm. regards Saramā as referred to; and, in futile  
attempt at explaining her possession of four eyes, says *etenā  
’pradhṛṣyaivam uktam*. ⌊Cf. Weber, *Berl. St.*, 1895, p. 849, n. 3.⌋ He  
explains the reference to eyes by the resemblance of the flowers of the  
plant in question; but this looks rather like a plausible guess than  
like a statement on any authority. Ppp. has for first half-verse  
*kaśyapasya caturakṣas syaṅtyāś caturakṣā*. The comm. derives *vīdhra*  
from *vi-idh*, and glosses it with *antarikṣa*. The Anukr. appears to  
approve the abbreviation to *sū́ryam ’va* in **c**. ⌊Bloomfield thinks  
that *kaśyapa* punningly suggests *paśyaka* 'seer,' and cites TA. i. 8.  
8, *kaśyapaḥ paśyako bhavati yat sarvam paripaśyati*.

Thou art the sight of Kasyapa and of the hound who hath four eyes. Make the Pisacha manifest as Surya when he rides at noon.
