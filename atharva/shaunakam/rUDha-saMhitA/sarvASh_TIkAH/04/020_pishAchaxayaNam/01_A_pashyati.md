### Translation
1. He (?) looks on, he looks toward, he looks away, he looks: the sky,  
the atmosphere, then the earth—all that, O divine one (f.), he looks at.

### Notes
Ppp. has the 2d sing, *paśyasi* all the five times, and it is an easier  
reading (adopted by Grill in his translation), especially in **d**,  
unless we may emend *devi* to *devī́;* according to the comm., the  
subject throughout is the wearer of the amulet, and the divine one, as  
is also indicated by Kāuś., is the *sadampuṣpā* plant, a plant evidently  
having something about it that resembles or suggests eyes. Ppp. reads  
*ā* for *āt* in **c**. ⌊Read *prá* for *práti* in **a**? Pronounce  
*divāntar-* in **c**.⌋

It sees in front, it sees behind, it sees afar away, it sees The sky, the firmament, and earth: all this, O Goddess, it beholds.
