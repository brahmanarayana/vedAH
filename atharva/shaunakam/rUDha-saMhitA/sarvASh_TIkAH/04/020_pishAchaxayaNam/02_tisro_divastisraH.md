### Translation
2. Three skies, three earths, and these six directions severally—by  
thee let me see all beings, O divine herb.

### Notes
Ppp. has *mahī* (for *-īḥ*) instead of *pṛthak* in **b**, and in the  
second half-verse, *tathā ’ham sarvā yātṝṇa paśyāmi*. Some of our mss.  
(P.M.) give *páṣyāṇi* in **d**. Pāda **a** is redundant by a syllable,  
unless we pronounce *pṛthvī́s*. ⌊For the triplicity, comm. cites RV. ii.  
27. 8 and AB. ii. 17 end.⌋
