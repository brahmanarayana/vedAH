### Translation
3. Of that heavenly eagle art thou the eye-pupil; thou here hast  
ascended the earth as a wearied bride (*vadhū́*) a litter.

### Notes
Ppp. puts *divyasya* after *suparṇasya*. The ground of the comparisons  
made in the verse is altogether obscure, and the comm. casts no light  
upon them. ⌊Bloomfield discusses this vs., AJP. xvii. 402.⌋

The pupil, verily, art thou of that celestial Engle's eye. On earth hast thou alighted as a weary woman seeks her couch.
