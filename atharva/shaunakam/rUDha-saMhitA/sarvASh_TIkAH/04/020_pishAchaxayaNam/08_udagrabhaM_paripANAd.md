### Translation
8. I have seized (*ud-grabh*) out of his shelter (*paripā́ṇa*) the  
sorcerer, the *kimīdín;* with it do I see every one, both śūdra and  
Āryan.

### Notes
Ppp. has in **a, b** *-pāṇaṁ yātudhānāt kimīdinaḥ*. The comm. makes  
*tena* refer here to *yāludhānam*, and supplies *graham* to  
*sarvam*—evidently without reason.
