### Translation
7. Bless us in fights, O formidable ones; visit (*sam-sṛj*) with  
\[your\] thunderbolt whoever is a *kimīdín:* I praise Bhava-and-śarva;  
\[as\] a suppliant I call loudly on \[them\]; do ye free us from  
distress.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *me* for *nas* in **a**, and leaves *-su ugrāu* uncombined.  
⌊Its closing half-verse is as in the Vulgate (as may be inferred from  
the note to vs. 2).⌋

Comfort and aid us, ye strong Gods, in battles, at each Kimidin send your bolt of thunder. I, suppliant, praise and ever call on Bhav and Sarva. Set us free from grief and trouble.
