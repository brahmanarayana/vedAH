### Translation
2. Ye whose is whatever is on the way and afar; who are known as best  
shooters among arrow-bearers; who lord it etc. etc.

### Notes
Ppp. has *vitatāu* for *viditāu* (perhaps *vīḍitāu?*) in **b**, and its  
**c** reads *bhavāśarvāu bhavatam me syonāu*, which then continues to be  
(as in 26. 2-6) part of the refrain through vs. 6, taking the place of  
our **c**. The comm., with a couple of SPP's mss., has *iṣubhṛ́tāu* for  
*-tām* in **b**. He explains *abhyadhve* by *samīpadeśe*. Perhaps **a**  
means rather 'on whose way \[is\] even whatever is afar.'
