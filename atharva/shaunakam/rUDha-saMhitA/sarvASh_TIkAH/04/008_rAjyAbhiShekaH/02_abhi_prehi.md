### Translation
2. Go forward unto \[it\]; do not long (? *ven*) away, a stern (*ugrá*)  
corrector (*cettár*), rival-slayer; approach (*ā-sthā*), O increaser of  
friends; may the gods bless (*adhi-brū*) thee.

### Notes
Found, with vs. 3, in TB. (in ii. 7. 8¹), and also, with the remainder  
of the hymn, in K. (xxxvii. 9). ⌊It seems to be a reminiscence of the  
Indra-verse, RV. v. 31. 2, applied, like vs. 3 of this hymn, to the  
king.⌋ TB. reads in **a** (for *mā́ ’pa venas*) *vīráyasva*, and Ppp. has  
*vīḍayasva;* TB. gives, as also the comm., the nom. *mitravárdhanas* (a  
later repetition of the verse, in ii. 7. 16¹, presents *vṛtrahántamas*  
instead); and it ends with *bravan*,\* which is better, and might have  
been read in our text, as near half the mss. give it; but SPP. also  
accepts *bruvan*, with the comm. The comm. takes the "throne" as object  
of the first verb, and renders *mā́ ’pa venas* by *apakāmam anicchām mā  
kārṣīḥ* ⌊cf. *vi-ven* in BR.⌋. (Weber renders *ven* by "see.") \*⌊But  
the Poona ed., p. 716, has *bruvan*.⌋
