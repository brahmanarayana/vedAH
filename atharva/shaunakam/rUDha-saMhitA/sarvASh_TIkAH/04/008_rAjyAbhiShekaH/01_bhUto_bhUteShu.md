### Translation
1. The being (*bhūtá*) sets milk in beings; he has become the overlord  
of beings; Death attends (*car*) the royal consecration (*rājasū́ya*) of  
him; let him, as king, approve this royalty.

### Notes
The meaning is obscure. Very possibly *bhūtá* is taken here in more than  
one of its senses, by a kind of play upon the word. Weber renders it the  
first time by "powerful" (*kräftig*), nearly as the comm., whose gloss  
is *samṛddhaḥ;* the latter gives it the same sense the second time, but  
the third time simply *prāṇinām*. The introduction of "death" in the  
second half-verse suggests the interpretation (R.) that the deceased  
predecessor of the prince now to be consecrated is besought to give his  
sanction to the ceremony from the world of the departed (*bhūtá*). The  
comm. regards death as brought in in the character of *dharmarāja*, as  
he who requites good and evil deeds. TB. (in ii. 7. 15¹) is the only  
other text that has this verse, reading in **a** *carati práviṣṭaḥ* (for  
*páya ā́ dadhāti*) and in **c** *mṛtyāú:* the variants are of a character  
to make us distrust the value of the matter as admitting any consistent  
interpretation. Ppp. reads in **c** *sa te* for *tásya*.

The Being lays the sap of life in beings: he hath become the sovran Lord of creatures. Death comes to this man's royal consecration: let him as King own and allow this kingdom.
