### Translation
4. A tiger, upon the tiger's \[skin\], do thou stride out unto the great  
quarters; let all the people (*víśas*) want thee, the waters of heaven,  
rich in milk.

### Notes
That is, let the rains not desert thee (so the comm. also). This verse  
and the two following are found, in the same order, in TB. ii. 7. 15³⁻⁴;  
it puts *ádhi* after *vāiyyāghré* (*sic*) in **a**, reads *śrayasva* in  
**b**, and has for **d** *mā́ tvád rāṣṭrám ádhi bhraśat* (found below as  
vi. 87. 1 **d**, and in other texts: see under that verse). Ppp. gives  
*yanti* ⌊or *yānti?*⌋ instead of *vāñchantu* in **c**.
