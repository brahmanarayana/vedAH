### Translation
6. The heavenly waters, rich in milk, have poured upon thee with  
splendor; that thou be an increaser of friends, so shall Savitar make  
thee.

### Notes
Instead of our *asiñcan*, SPP. gives, as the reading of all his  
authorities, *asican*, which is decidedly preferable, and implied in the  
translation (our Bp. is doubtful; other mss. possibly overlooked at this  
point); TB. has instead *asicam;* Ppp. and the comm., *asṛjan*. Then,  
for **b**, TB. and Ppp. give *divyéna páyasā* (Ppp. *pāy-*) *sahá;* and  
in **c** TB. has *rāṣṭravárdh-,* which is better, and before it  
*yáthā́sā* (regarded by its commentary as *yáthā: ā́sa*).
