### Translation
5. The waters of heaven that revel with milk, in the atmosphere or also  
on the earth—with the splendor of all those waters do I pour upon  
(*abhi-sic*) thee.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The version of the first half-verse given by TB. is quite different: *yā́  
divyā́ ā́paḥ páyasā sambabhūvúḥ: yā́ antárikṣe utá pā́rthivīr yā́ḥ;* and Ppp.  
so far agrees as to have *uta pārthivā yāḥ;* TB. also reads *rucā́* for  
*apā́m* in **c**. The comm. renders *madanti* as if causative: *prāṇinas  
tarpayanti*. The *abhiṣeka* process, instead of an anointing with oil,  
is a pouring of water upon the person to be consecrated. The verse (11 +  
10: 8 + 8 = 37) lacks three syllables of being complete, rather than  
two. ⌊Put another *yā́s* at the beginning of **b** and the verse is  
orderly, 11 + 11: 8 + 8.⌋  
  
⌊Perhaps *mad* here approaches its physical meaning, 'boil (cf. śB. iii.  
4. 3 end, and my *Reader*, p. 211), bubble over, overflow'; used of the  
rains that 'drip abundantly with.' *páyas* or life-giving moisture. W's  
prior draft rendered *mad* by "intoxicate"; over this he interlined  
"revel."—This, says Weber, is the verse of the act of consecration  
proper. The celebrant transfers to the king the *várcas* or glory-giving  
vigor of the waters of all three worlds.⌋
