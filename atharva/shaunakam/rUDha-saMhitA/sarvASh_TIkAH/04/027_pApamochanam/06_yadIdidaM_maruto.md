### Translation
6. If now indeed, O Maruts, by what relates to the Maruts—if, O gods, by  
what relates to the gods, I have fallen into such a plight: ye, O Vasus,  
are masters (*īś*) of the removal of that: let them free us from  
distress.

### Notes
That is (**a, b**), apparently, "by reason of what offense"  
(*aparādhena*, comm.); perhaps "if such a \[mishap\] hath befallen  
\[us\]" (so the comm.); but MS. iii. 8. 4, *īdṛ́g u sá ā́riṣyati*,  
supports the translation as given, and also indicates that *ā́ra* is here  
*ā-ā́ra;* but the *pada*-text gives *ā́ra* simply. ⌊See also Weber's  
citation from PB. xiii. 3. 12.⌋ Several mss. (including our Op.) have  
*īśadhve* in **c**, as the comm. reads. *Mā́nuṣeṇa* for *mā́rutena* in  
**a** would be an acceptable emendation.

Whether with stormy might the Maruts established this All, or Gods with their celestial power, Ye, kindly Gods, are able to restore it. May they deliver us from grief and trouble.
