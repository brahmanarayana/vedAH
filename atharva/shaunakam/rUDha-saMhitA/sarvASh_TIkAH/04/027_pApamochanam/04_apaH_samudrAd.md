### Translation
4. Waters from the ocean to the sky they carry up, they who pour  
\[them\] from the sky upon the earth—the Maruts who go about lording it  
with the waters: let them free us from distress.

### Notes
The absence of accent of *vahanti* forbids us to make the better  
construction of it with *yé*—which, however, the comm. does not scruple  
to adopt.

They who raised water from the sea to heaven and send it from the sky to earth in showers, The Maruts who move mighty with their waters, may they deliver us from grief and trouble.
