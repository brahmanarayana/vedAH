### Translation
3. Ye, O poets, that send the milk of the kine, the sap of the herbs,  
the speed of the coursers—let the helpful (? *śagmá*) Maruts be pleasant  
to us; let them free us from distress.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *invan* at end of **b**; the comm. renders *invatha* by  
*vyāpayatha;* he also takes *kavayas* as nominative, and (with one of  
SPP's mss.) reads at beginning of **c** *śakmās*, explaining it as =  
*sarvakāryasamarthās*. All our *saṁhitā*-mss. save one (E.) ⌊R. not  
noted⌋ combine *na syon-* in **c**.
