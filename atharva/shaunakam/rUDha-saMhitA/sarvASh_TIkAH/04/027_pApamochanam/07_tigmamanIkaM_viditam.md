### Translation
7. A sharp front, known \[as\] powerful, \[is\] the troop (*śárdhas*) of  
Maruts, formidable in fights; I praise the Maruts, \[as\] a suppliant I  
call loudly on \[them\]: let them free us from distress.

### Notes
The other texts have in **a** *vīḍitám*, for which our *viditám* is a  
pretty evident corruption; they also have *ā́yudham* for *ánīkam*, in  
**b** *divyám* for *mā́rutam* and *jiṣṇú* for *ugrám;* and in **c** they  
insert *devā́n* before *marútas*, also ending the verse (as well as vs.  
1) with *énasas*.

Potent in battles is the Maruts' army, impetuous train, well- known, exceeding mighty. I, suppliant, praise and oft invoke the Maruts. May they deliver us from grief and trouble.
