### Translation
5. They who gratify with sweet drink, who with ghee; or who combine  
(*sam-sṛj*) vigor (*váyas*) with fatness; the Maruts who, lording it  
with the waters, cause to rain: let them free us from distress.

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **a** (as in 26. 6 a) *kīlālāis;* and it rectifies the  
meter of **c** by omitting  *adbhis*. The comm. takes *váyas* first as  
"bird" (*pakṣijātam*), then as *śarīrapariṇāmaviśeṣas*.

They who delight in nectar and in fatness, they who bestow upon us health and vigour. The Maruts who rain mighty with their waters, may they deliver us from grief and trouble.
