### Translation
8. Having wiped off the sorcerers, off all the hags, O off-wiper, with  
thee do we wipe off all that.

### Notes
Ppp. is defaced in this verse. The comm. first explains *apamṛ́jya* in  
**a** into an imperative, *apamṛḍḍhi;* but then, as an alternative, he  
allows it its own proper sense.

Sweep thou away the sorcerers, all stingy fiendish hags away. All this, O Apamarga, with thine aid we wipe away from us.
