### Translation
5. I, with this herb, have spoiled all witchcrafts—what one they have  
made in the field, what in the kine, or what in thy men (*púruṣa*).

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **c** and **d** the datives *gobhyas* and *puruṣebhyas;*  
the comm. explains *puruṣeṣu* as "in a place frequented by them"; for  
*vā te* he reads *vāte* 'in the wind.' A few of our mss. (P.M.W.) have  
*adūduṣan* in **b**. The Anukr. takes no notice of the deficiency of a  
syllable in **d**.
