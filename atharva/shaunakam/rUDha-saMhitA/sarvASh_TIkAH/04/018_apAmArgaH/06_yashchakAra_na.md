### Translation
6. He who hath made hath not been able to make; he hath crushed (*śṛ*) a  
foot, a finger; he hath made what is excellent for us, but for himself a  
burning (*tápana*).

### Notes
The verse is repeated below as v. 31. 11, but with a different last  
pāda, which reads: *abhagó bhágavadbhyaḥ*. Ppp's version of **a-b** is  
*yāṁ cakāra na śaśākha śaśire pādam an̄gulim* (omitting *kartum*); *yām*  
⌊sc. *kṛtyā́m?*⌋ is a preferable reading. The comm. also has *an̄gulim;*  
our *-rim* is authenticated by the comment to Prāt. i. 66. Ppp's **d**  
reads as does our v. 31. 11 **d**, but with *abhagā* for *-gó*. The  
verse is metrically defined in the same way as here at v. 31. 11 ⌊the  
Anukr. seems to scan it as 8 + 9: 8 + 8 (cf., for example, iii. 8. 4)⌋;  
but *kártum* is evidently ⌊as the accent of *śaśré* shows⌋ to be  
reckoned to **a**, and the *pada*-mss. so divide. ⌊The suspicion is  
natural that a *sá* has been lost between *ná* and *śaśā́ka*. So *ca* has  
been lost at iv. 5. 5 **a** (cf. RV. vii. 55. 6 **a**). If we are right  
in restoring *sá*, and if we pronounce *śaśṛ-é* (as the Ppp. reading  
suggests), we should then scan 11 + 8: 8 + 8.—The accent of *śaśā́ka* can  
hardly be more than a blunder.—-The comment to this verse seems to have  
failed of thorough revision at W's hands.⌋

No power had he who wrought the spell: he hurt his foot, he broke his toe. His act hath brought us happiness and pain and sorrow to him- self.
