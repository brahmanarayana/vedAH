### Translation
2. Whoso, O gods, having made witchcraft, shall take it to the house of  
one unknowing—let it, like a sucking (*dhārú*) calf to its mother, go  
back unto him.

### Notes
The comm., with one or two of SPP's mss., reads *árāt* instead of  
*hárāt* in **b**; *dhārús* he defines by *stanapānaṁ kurvan*. There is a  
redundant syllable in **c** unless we abbreviate *iva* to *’va*.
