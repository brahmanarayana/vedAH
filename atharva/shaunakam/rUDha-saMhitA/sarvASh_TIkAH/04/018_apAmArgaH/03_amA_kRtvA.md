### Translation
3. Whoso, having made evil at home, desires to slay another with  
it—numerous stones make a loud crash when it (f.) is burned.

### Notes
Ppp. is partly defaced in this verse; and it gives us no aid in solving  
the difficulties of the second half. The discordance between the  
masculines *yás* and *pāpmā́nam* in **a, b** and the feminine *tā́syām* is  
perhaps best removed by supposing *kṛtyā* to have been mentally  
substituted for *pāpman* (the comm. supplies *kṛtyāyām* to *tasyām*);  
Grill violently emends *amā́* in **a** to *āmā́yām* (sc. *pātryā́m*\*), and  
thinks that this raw vessel bursts noisily in pieces when burnt; R.  
conjectures that thick stones crack when the *kṛtyā* is burnt, perhaps  
so as to wake the intended victim. The comm. paraphrases *amā* by  
*anukūla iva saha sthitaḥ*, i.e. an assistant or confederate, and reads  
in **c** *dugdhāyām* "drained" or made ineffective; the stones are  
produced by the countermagic, and are called on to do (*karikrati* =  
*punaḥ-punaḥ kurvantu:* a convenient substitution of the imperative!)  
damage (*phaṭ*=*hiṅsanam*) to the *kṛtyā-kṛt*. The translation given  
above implies a threat of the destruction of the *kṛtyā* by burning and  
by stones tumbling crash! (*phaṭ* for *phaṣ?*) upon it. The harsh  
resolution *kṛtu-ā́* makes the verse a full *anuṣṭubh*. ⌊Bp. also has  
*dugdhā́yām*.⌋ \*⌊Oxytone, not perispome.⌋

When one puts poison in a dish of unbaked clay to kill a man, It cracks when set upon the fire with the sharp sound of many stones.
