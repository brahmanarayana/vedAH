### Translation
2. Sapless is the poison of the east, sapless what is of the north;  
also this that is of the south is exchangeable with gruel (*karambhá*).

### Notes
That is, is no stronger or more harmful than gruel. Except our Bp.,  
which has *adharā́cyàm*, all the mss. accent *-rā́cyam*, and SPP. follows  
them; our edition emends to *-rācyàm*, to accord with the two adjectives  
of like formation in **a, b**. Ppp. puts *arasam* after *viṣam* in  
**a**.

Weak is the poison of the East, weak is the poison of the North, So too this poison of the South counts as a cake of curds and meal.
