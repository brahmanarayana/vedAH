### Translation
5. With a spell we cause to stand about \[thee\] as it were a collected  
troop (*grā́ma*); stand thou, like a tree in \[its\] station; spade-dug  
one (f.), thou rackest not.

### Notes
The comm., here and in 6 **d**, reads *abhriṣāte* (*-ṣāte* = *-labdhe*),  
which looks like a result of the common confusion of *kh* and *ṣ*. SPP.  
reads in *pada*-text *rūrupaḥ*, and this time without any report as to  
the readings of his *pada*-mss.—doubtless by an oversight, as all but  
one of them give *rur-* in both 3 **d** and 6 **d**. The true scanning  
of **c** is probably *vṛkṣé ’va sthā́-mn-i*.

We set around thee with the spell as 'twere a gathered arma- ment. Stay quiet like a rooted tree. Dug up with mattocks, gripe not thou.
