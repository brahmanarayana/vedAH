### Translation
1. This water (*vā́r*) shall ward off (*vāray-*) upon the Varaṇāvatī; an  
on-pouring of ambrosia (*amṛ́ta*) is there; with it I ward off thy  
poison.

### Notes
The significance of the verse lies in its punning upon *vār* and *var;*  
the name *varaṇāvatī* is not found elsewhere, but has sufficient  
analogies elsewhere; it is formed, as the comm. points out, from the  
tree-name *varaṇa* (*Crataeva Roxburghii*). Ppp. has in **b** a  
different pun: *varuṇād ābhṛtam;* and for **d** it reads *tac cakārā  
’rasaṁ viṣam*. The first pāda lacks a syllable, unless we resolve  
*va-ā́r*. ⌊Cf. x. 3. 1 n.⌋

So may this water guard us on the bank of Varanavati. Therein hath Amrit been infused: with that I ward thy poison off.
