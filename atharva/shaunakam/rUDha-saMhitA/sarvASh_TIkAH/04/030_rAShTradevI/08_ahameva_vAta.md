### Translation
8. I myself blow forth like the wind, taking hold upon all beings;  
beyond the sky, beyond the earth here—such have I become by greatness.

### Notes
RV. has *mahinā́* instead of *mahimnā́* in **d** ⌊cf. Bloomfield, JAOS.  
xvi. p. clvi = PAOS. Dec. 1894⌋. In our edition, *divó* in **c** is a  
misprint for *divā́*. ⌊*Enā́* is hardly for *enayā* (Weber): cf. JAOS. x.  
333.⌋  
  
With this hymn ends the sixth *anuvāka*, of 5 hymns and 36 verses; the  
Anukr. extract, *ṣaṭ*, is given by only one ms. (D.).  
  
Here, too, by a rather strange division, ends the eighth *prapāṭhaka*.

I breathe a strong breath like the wind and tempest, the while I hold together all existence. Beyond this wide earth and beyond the heavens I have become so mighty in my grandeur.
