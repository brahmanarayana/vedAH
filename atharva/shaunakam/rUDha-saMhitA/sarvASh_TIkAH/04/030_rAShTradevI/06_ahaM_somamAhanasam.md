### Translation
6. I bear the heady (? *āhanás*) soma, I Tvashṭar, also Pūshan, Bhaga; I  
assign property to the giver of oblations, to the very zealous (?), the  
sacrificer, the presser of soma.

### Notes
RV. (vs. 2) has in **c** the sing. *dráviṇam*, and in **d** the dative  
*suprāvyè* (which is implied in the translation given); in both points  
the comm. agrees with RV., and one of SPP's authorities supports him.  
But the Prāt. (iv. 11) establishes *suprāvyā̀* as the true Atharvan  
reading. The comm. gives a double explanation of *āhanasam* in **a**: as  
*abhiṣotavyam* and as *śatrūṇām āhantāram*. The Anukr. does not heed  
that the first pāda is *triṣṭubh*.

I cherish and sustain high-swelling Soma, and Tvashtar I support, Pashan, and Bhaga. I load with wealth the zealous sacrificer who pours the juice and offers his oblation.
