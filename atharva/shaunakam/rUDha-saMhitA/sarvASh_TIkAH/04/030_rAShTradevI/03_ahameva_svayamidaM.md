### Translation
3. I my own self say this, \[which is\] enjoyable of gods and of men;  
whomsoever I desire, him I make formidable, him priest (*brahmán*), him  
seer, him very wise.

### Notes
RV. (vs. 5) has in **b** the equivalent *devébhis* and *mā́nuṣebhis*. The  
comm. absurdly explains *brahmā́ṇam* by *sraṣṭāram*, or the god Brahman.+++(5)+++

I, verily, myself announce and utter the word that Gods, and men alike shall welcome. I make the man I love exceeding mighty, make him a sage, a Rishi, and a Brahman.
