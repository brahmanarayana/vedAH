### Translation
2. I am queen, gatherer of good things, the first that has understood  
the matters of sacrifice; me here the gods distributed manifoldly,  
making me of many stations enter into many.

### Notes
RV. (vs. 3) differs only by reading at the end *āveśáyantīm*. The comm.  
makes *yajñíyānām* in **b** depend upon *prathamā́*, *cikitúī* being a  
separate epithet: this is, of course, equally possible.

I am the Queen, the gatherer-up of treasures, most thoughtful, first of those who merit worship. The Gods, making me enter many places, in diverse spots have set mine habitation.
