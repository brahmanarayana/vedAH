### Translation
1. I go about with the Rudras, the Vasus, I with the Ādityas and the  
All-gods; I bear Mitra-and-Varuṇa both, I Indra-and-Agni, I both Aśvins.

### Notes
There is in this verse no variant from the RV. text. The comm. says that  
"I" is the daughter. Speech by name, of the great sage Ambhṛṇa, and that  
she by her own nature knew the supreme *brahman*.

I travel with the Rudras and the Vasus, with the Adityas and All-Gods I wander. I hold aloft both Varuna and Mitra, I hold aloft Indra and both the Asvins.
