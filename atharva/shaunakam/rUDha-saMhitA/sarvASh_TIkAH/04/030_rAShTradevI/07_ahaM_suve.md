### Translation
7. I quicken (give birth to?) the father in its (his?) head; my womb  
(*yóni*) is within the waters, the ocean; thence I extend myself  
(*vi-sthā*) to all beings; even yon sky I touch with my summit.

### Notes
RV. reads in **c** *bhúvanā́ ’nu* for *-nāni*. The comm., followed by one  
of SPP's authorities, has the odd blunder *caṣṭe* for *tiṣṭhe* in **c**.  
He further takes *asya* in **a** as meaning *dṛśyamānasya prapañcasya*,  
and *pitaram* as *prapañcasya janakam*.

On the world's summit I bring forth the Father: my home is in the waters, in the ocean. Thence I extend o'er all existing creatures, and touch even yonder heaven with my forehead.
