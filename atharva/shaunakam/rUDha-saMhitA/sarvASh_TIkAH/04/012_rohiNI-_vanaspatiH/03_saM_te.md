### Translation
3. Let thy marrow come together with marrow, and thy joint together with  
joint; together let what of thy flesh has fallen apart, together let thy  
bone grow over.

### Notes
Ppp. rectifies the meter of **a** by omitting *te*, and has for **d** ⌊?  
**b**?⌋ *saṁstrāvam asu parva te*. A few of the mss. (including our  
H.O.Op.) give *viśrastam* in **c**. The comm. reads *śam* instead of  
*sam* in every pāda. A couple of SPP's mss., by a substitution found  
also elsewhere ⌊see ii. 12. 7, note⌋, have *manyā́* for *majjñā́* in  
**a**. The Anukr. ignores the redundant syllable in the first pāda.

With marrow be the marrow joined, thy limb united with the limb. Let what hath fallen of thy flesh, and the bone also grow again.
