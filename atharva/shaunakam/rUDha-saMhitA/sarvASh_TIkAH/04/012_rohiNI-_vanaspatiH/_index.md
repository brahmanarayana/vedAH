### Comment
Found in Pāipp. iv. (in the verse-order 3-5, 1, 2, 7, 6). Used by Kāuś. (28. 5) in a healing rite: Keśava and the comm. agree in saying, for the prevention of flow of blood caused by a blow from a sword or the like; boiled lākṣā—water is to be poured on the wound etc. The schol. to Kāuś. 28. 14 also regard the hymn as included among the lākṣālin̄gās prescribed to be used in that rule.
