### Translation
4. Let marrow be put together with marrow; let skin (*cárman*) grow  
(*ruh*) with skin; let thy blood, bone grow; let flesh grow with flesh.

### Notes
The third pāda is translated as it stands ⌊cf. vs. 5 **c**⌋, but we can  
hardly avoid emending *ásṛk* to *asthnā́*, or else *ásthi* to *asnā́*, to  
agree with the others; the comm. ⌊as an alternative⌋ fills it out to two  
parallel expressions, for both blood and bone. Ppp. has, for **b-d**:  
*asthnā ’sthi vi rohatu snāva te saṁ dadhmas snāvnā carmaṇā carma  
rohatu*.

Let marrow close with marrow, let skin grow united with the skin. Let blood and bone grow strong in thee, flesh grow together with the flesh.
