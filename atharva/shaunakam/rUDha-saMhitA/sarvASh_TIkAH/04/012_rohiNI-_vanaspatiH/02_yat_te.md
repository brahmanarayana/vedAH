### Translation
2. What of thee is torn (*riś*), what of thee is inflamed (? *dyut*), is  
crushed (? *péṣṭra*) in thyself—may Dhātar excellently put that together  
again, joint with joint.

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **a** *śīrṇaṁ* for *riṣṭam;* it reads *tā ”tmanaḥ* in  
**b**; and in **c, d** it has *tat sarvaṁ kalpayāt saṁ dadat*. The comm.  
(with one of SPP's mss.) reads *preṣṭham* (= *priyatamam*) for the  
obscure *péṣṭram* in **b** (found elsewhere only in vi. 37. 3 below,  
where the comm. has *peṣṭam*); the conjecture "bone" of the Pet. Lex.  
seems altogether unsatisfactory; it is rendered above as if from *piṣ*.  
The comm. paraphrases *dyuttám* by *dyotitam, vedanayā prajvalitam iva*,  
which seems acceptable.

Whatever bone of thine within thy body hath been wrenched or cracked, May Dhatar set it properly and join together limb by limb.
