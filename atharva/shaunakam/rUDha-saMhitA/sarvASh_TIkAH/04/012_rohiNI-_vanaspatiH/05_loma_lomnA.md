### Translation
5. Fit thou together hair with hair; fit together skin (*tvác*) with  
skin; let thy blood, bone grow; put together what is severed, O herb.

### Notes
The prolongation of the final vowel of a pāda is so anomalous that we  
can hardly help regarding *kalpayā* in **a** as wrong, perhaps imitated  
from **b**; Ppp. avoids the difficulty by reading in **a** *saṁ  
dhīyatām*. ⌊For **c**, compare vs. 4.⌋ Ppp. also has for **d** our 4  
**d**.
