### Translation
1. On the earth they paid reverence (*sam-nam*) to Agni; he throve  
(*ṛdh*); as on earth they paid reverence to Agni, so let the reverencers  
pay reverence to me.

### Notes
The TS. version reads thus: *agnáye sám anamat pṛthivyāí sám anamad  
yáthā ’gníḥ pṛthivyā́* (!) *samánamad evám máhyam bhadrā́ḥ sáṁnatayaḥ sáṁ  
namantu*. The comm. explains *sám anaman* by *sarvāṇi bhūtāni saṁnatāni  
upasannāni bhavanti*, and *saṁnámas* by *abhilaṣitaphalasya saṁnatayaḥ  
samprāptayaḥ*. The metrical definitions of the Anukr. for vss. 1-8 are  
of no value; the odd verses vary from 34 to 37 syllables, and the even  
from 38 to 40. ⌊We might have expected the epithet *tryavasāna*  
(*3-av.*) to be applied to the even.⌋

Agni no earth kath had mine homage. May he bless me. As I have bowed me down to Agni on the earth, so let the Favouring Graces bow them down to me.
