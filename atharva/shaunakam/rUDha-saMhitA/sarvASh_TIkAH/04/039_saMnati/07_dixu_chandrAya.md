### Translation
7. In the quarters they paid reverence to the moon (*candrá*); it  
throve; as in the quarters they paid reverence to the moon, so let the  
reverencers pay reverence to me.

### Notes
In TS., the asterisms (*nákṣatra*) are here connected with the moon; and  
there follow similar passages respecting Varuṇa with the waters, and  
several other divinities.

To Chandra in the quarters have I bowed me. May he bless me. As unto Chandra in the quarters I have bent, so let the Favour- ing Graces bow them down to me.
