### Translation
10. Purified with the heart, with the mind, O Jātavedas—knowing all the  
ways (*vayúna*), O god; seven mouths are thine, O Jātavedas; to them I  
make offering—do thou enjoy the oblation.

### Notes
*Pūtám* in **a** can only qualify *havyám* in **d**: compare RV. iv. 58.  
6 **b**, *antár hṛdā́ mánasā pūyámānāḥ*. The *pada*-text makes one of its  
frequent blunders by resolving in **c** *saptā́syāni* into *saptá:  
ā́syāni* instead of into *saptá: āsyàni*, the designation of the accent  
in *saṁhitā* being the same in both cases, according to its usual  
method. SPP. accepts the blunder, reading *ā́syāni.*  
  
It is impossible to see why these two concluding verses should have been  
added to the hymn.

Skilled in all ways, O God, O Jatavedas, I offer what is cleansed by heart and spirit. To all thy seven mouths, O Jatavedas. Do thou accept with pleasure my libation.
