### Translation
8. The quarters are milch-cows; of them the moon is calf; let them, with  
the moon as calf, milk for me etc. etc.

### Notes
Both editions read *duhām* in this verse, as in vss. 2, 4, 6, following  
the authority of nearly all the mss.; only our H.D. have the true  
reading, *duhrām*, which ought to have been adopted in our text.

The quarters are the Cows, their calf is Chandra. May they yield with their calf the Moon food, strength and all my wish, life first of all, and offspring, plenty, wealth. All Hail!
