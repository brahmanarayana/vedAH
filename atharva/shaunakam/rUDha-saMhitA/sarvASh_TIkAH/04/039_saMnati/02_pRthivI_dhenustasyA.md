### Translation
2. Earth \[is\] milch-cow; of her Agni \[is\] calf; let her, with Agni  
as calf, milk for me food (*íṣ*), refreshment, \[my\] desire, life-time  
first, progeny, prosperity, wealth: hail!

### Notes
There is in TS. nothing to correspond to our vss. 2, 4, 6, 8. Our  
edition combines *ā́yuṣ pr-*, because required by Prāt. ii. 75; but the  
mss., except one of SPP's, have *ā́yuḥ pr-*, which SPP. retains.

Earth is the Cow, her calf is Agni. May she with her calf Agni yield me food, strength, all my wish, life first of all, and off- spring, plenty, wealth. All Hail!
