### Translation
5. He whose enjoyment (*júṣṭi*) the offerers of soma desire; whom,  
possessed of arrows, men call on in the cattle-raid (*gáviṣṭi*); on whom  
depends song (? *arká*), on whom force—let him free us from distress.

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **b** *iṣuvantam*. Prāt. ii. 23 teaches the form of  
*gaviṣṭi*. The comm. explains *arkas* as *arcanasādhanabhūto mantraḥ  
stutaśastrādilakṣaṇaḥ*.

Whose favour those desire who offer Soma, whom, arrow-bearer, men invoke in battle, On whom the hymn depends, in whom is power, May he deliver us from grief and trouble.
