### Translation
7. He who, controlling, leads together hosts (*saṁgrāmá*) for fighting;  
who mingles (*sam-sṛj*) the possessions (*puṣṭá*) of the two parties—I  
praise Indra, \[as a\] suppliant I call loudly on \[him\]: let him free  
us from distress.

### Notes
Ppp. has in **b** *puṣṭyā nas*. TS. and MS. read in **a** (as does also  
the comm.) the sing. *saṁgrānám*, and they put *yudhé* after *vaśī́;* at  
end of **b** they give *trayā́ṇi* instead of *dvayā́ni*. The comm. thinks  
*dvayāni* to be *strīpuṁsātmakāni mithunāni*.

Strong Lord, who leadeth hosts to meet for battle, who sendeth riches both of earth and heaven, I, suppliant, praise and ever call on Indra. May he deliver us from grief and trouble.
