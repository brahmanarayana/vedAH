### Translation
2. He who, having formidable arms, is repeller (? *yayú*) of the  
formidable ones (f.); who battered the strength of the Dānavas; by whom  
are conquered the rivers, by whom the kine—let him free us from  
distress.

### Notes
Ppp. has in **a** *yo ‘graṇāṁ* and omits, *yayus;* and at end of **b**  
it reads *āsasāda*. The first pāda is full of questionable points, and  
probably corrupt; the comm. explains *yuyus* (though SPP. says in a note  
that his text reads *yayus*), and by *yāvayitā pṛthakkartā;* to  
*ugrīṇām* he supplies *śatrusenānām*.
