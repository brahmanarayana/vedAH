### Translation
6. He who was born first for the doing of deeds; of whom first the  
heroism was noted; by whom brandished (*ud-yam*) the thunderbolt went at  
(*abhi-i*) the dragon—let him free us from distress.

### Notes
As in one or two other cases,\* the mss. have in **a** *yajñé* instead  
of *jajñé;* but one or two of SPP's follow the comm., who reads *jajñé*,  
as does also Ppp.; and both of the editions give this. In **b** the  
comm., with three of SPP's authorities, gives *ánubaddham;* in **c** he  
derives *āyata* from root *yam*, and renders it by *ahiṅsīt;* we might  
emend to *abhyā́yató ‘him* and get a form from that root, which would  
yield a preferable sense. ⌊For the use of *abhi-i* with *vajra* as  
subject and with acc., Whitney has noted the excellent parallel, RV. i.  
80. 12.⌋ \*⌊So x. 10. 18.⌋

Why was born, first, for active operation, whose valour as the first hath been awakened, Who raised his bolt when he encountered Ahi. May he deliver us from grief and trouble.
