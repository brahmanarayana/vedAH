### Translation
7. The mingled riches of both sides, put together, let Varuṇa and fury  
assign to us; conceiving fears in their hearts, let the foes, conquered,  
vanish away.

### Notes
Instead of *dhattām*, RV. and the comm. have in **b** *dattām;* Ppp.  
reads *dattaṁ varuṇaś ca manyo;* RV. gives *bhíyam* in **c**; Ppp. has a  
peculiar **d**: *parājitā yantu paramāṁ parāvatam*. Certain of our mss.  
(Bp.E.I.) accent at the end *láyantām*.

For spoil let Varuna and Manyu give us the wealth of both sides gathered and collected; And let our enemies with stricken spirits, o'er-whelmed with. terror, sling away defeated.
