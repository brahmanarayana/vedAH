### Translation
5. Victory-making, like Indra, not to be talked down, do thou, O fury,  
be our over-lord here; thy dear name we sing, O powerful one; we know  
that fount whence thou camest (*ā-bhū*).

### Notes
The comm. explains *anavabravá* as "speaking things—i.e. means of  
victory—that are not new (*a-nava*)." The verses 5-7 are not full  
*jagatīs*.

Unyielding, bringing victory like Indra, O Manyu be thou here our sovran ruler. To thy dear name. O victor, we sing praises: we know the spring from which thou art come hither.
