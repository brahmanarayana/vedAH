### Translation
11. Twelve, indeed, they declare those nights of the vow (*vrátya*) of  
Prajāpati; whoso knows the *bráhman* within them (*tátro ’pa*)—that  
verily is the vow of the draft-ox.

### Notes
Or, "those twelve nights they declare to be for the vow" etc.: it is  
uncertain what is object and what objective predicate in the sentence.  
Ppp. reads and combines *vrātyā ”huṣ pr-* in **b**; for the unusual  
phrase *tatro ’pa* in **c** it gives *tad vā ’pi;* and in **d** it has  
*balam* instead of *vratam*. For Weber's conjectures as to the twelve  
nights and the draft-ox of this hymn, see his *Omina und Portenta*, p.  
388; compare also ⌊Weber's other references, *Ind. Stud.* xviii. 45,  
and⌋ Zimmer, p. 366. The comm. glosses *vratya* by *vratārha*, and  
quotes TS. v. 6. 7¹ as to the twelve nights of consecration.

Assigned are these twelve nights, they say, as holy to Prajapati: Whoever knows their proper prayer performs the service of the Ox.
