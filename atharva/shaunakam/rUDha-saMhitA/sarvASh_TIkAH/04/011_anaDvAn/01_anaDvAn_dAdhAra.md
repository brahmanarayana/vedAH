### Translation
1. The draft-ox sustains earth and sky; the draft-ox sustains the wide  
atmosphere; the draft-ox sustains the six wide directions; the draft-ox  
hath entered into all existence.

### Notes
That is, the ox in his capacity of draft-animal: the comm. says,  
*śakaṭavahanasamartho vṛṣabhaḥ;* later in the hymn he is treated as  
female, without change of the name to a feminine form (the fem. *-ḍuhī*  
or *-ḍvāhī* does not occur before the Brāhmaṇa-period of the language).  
But the comm. also allows us the alternative of regarding *dharma*, in  
ox-form, as subject of the hymn. The "directions" (*pradíś*) are,  
according to him, "east etc."; and the "six wide" are "heaven, earth,  
day, night, waters, and plants," for which AśS. i. 2. 1 is quoted as  
authority. With the verse compare x. 7. 35, where nearly the same things  
are said of *skambha.* Ppp. reads in **a** *-vīṁ dyām utā ’mūm*. In the  
second half-verse, two accent-marks have slipped out of place in our  
edition: in **c**, that under *ṣa* should stand under *ḍu;* and, in  
**d**, that under *mā* should stand under *na*. The verse is *jagatī* by  
count, but not by rhythm. ⌊If, with Weber, we pronounce *naḍvā́n*, it  
becomes a regular *triṣṭubh*.⌋

The Bull supports the wide-spread earth and heaven, the Bull supports the spacious air between them. The Bull supports the sky's six spacious regions: the universal world hath he pervaded.
