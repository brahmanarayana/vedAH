### Translation
10. With his feet treading down debility (*sedí*), with his thighs  
(*ján̄ghā*) extracting (*ut-khid*) refreshing drink—with weariness go the  
draft-ox and the plowman unto sweet drink (*kīlála*).

### Notes
The verse seems rather out of place here. As both *n* and *m* final are  
assimilated to an initial palatal, the *pada*-text commits the blunder  
in **b** of understanding *írāṁ* to be for *írān;* and, as is usual in  
such cases, a part of our mss. read *írān j-* (so P.M.W.E.I.); SPP. very  
properly emends his *pada*-text to *írām*. The comm. reads in **d**  
*kīnāśasya* for *-śaś ca* (one of SPP's authorities following him: "with  
the old accent," SPP. remarks, as if the change of reading involved a  
change of accent), and makes *gachatas* a genitive agreeing with  
it—against the accent; but this he regularly ignores. *Irām*, it may be  
added, he glosses with *bhūmim!*

With feet subduing weariness, with legs extracting freshening draughts, Through toil the plougher and the Ox approach the honeyed beverage.
