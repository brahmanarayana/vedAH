### Translation
5. Of whom the lord of the sacrifice is not master (*īś*), nor the  
sacrifice; not the giver is master of him, nor the acceptor; who is  
all-conquering, all-bearing, all-working—tell ye us the hot-drink which  
\[is\] four-footed.

### Notes
"Which" in **d** is *yatamá*, lit. 'which among the many.' The intended  
answer, of course, is that this wondrous sacrificial drink is the ox.  
Ppp. begins **c** with *yo viśvadṛg viśvakṛd v-*. The comm. declares the  
first half-verse to convey the universal masterhood and  
not-to-be-mastered-hood of the ox; in **d** *gharma* is, according to  
him, "the blazing sun, which the four-footed one tells us" (*brūta* is  
read, but declared equivalent to *brūte!*).

That which not sacrifice nor sacrificer, not giver nor receiver rules and governs, All-winning, all-supporting, all-effecting,--which of all quadru- peds, tell us! is the Caldron?
