### Translation
6. By whom the gods ascended to heaven (*svàr*), quitting the body, to  
the navel of the immortal, by him may we go to the world of the  
well-done, desiring glory, by the vow (*vratá*) of the hot-drink, by  
penance.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Ppp. appears to have read in **a** *suvā ruhanta;* in **b** it has  
*dhama* instead of *nā́bhim;* and it ends **d** with *yaśasā tapasvyā*.  
The comm. has *jeṣma* (=*jayema*) in **c** ⌊instead of *geṣma* (*Skt.  
Gram.* §894 c)⌋; *gharma* is to him once more "the blazing sun." ⌊As to  
the stock-phrase in **c**, cf. Bloomfield, AJP. xvii. 419.⌋ The verse  
(10 + 11: 10 + 13 = 44) is a very poor *triṣṭubh*.

May we, fame-seekers, reach the world of virtue by service of the Gharma and through fervour, Whereby the Gods went up to heaven, the centre of life eternal, having left the body.
