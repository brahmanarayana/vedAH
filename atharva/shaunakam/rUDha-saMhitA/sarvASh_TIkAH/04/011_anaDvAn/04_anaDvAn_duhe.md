### Translation
4. The draft-ox yields milk (*duh*) in the world of the well-done; the  
purifying one fills him up from in front; Parjanya \[is\] his streams,  
the Maruts his udder, the sacrifice his milk, the sacrificial gift the  
milking of him.

### Notes
Ppp. appears to have read in **b** *pyāyet*, which would rectify the  
meter; in **c** it combines *maruto ”dho*. *Pávamāna* in **b** might  
signify the wind (then *purástāt* 'from the east'?) or soma; the comm.  
takes it as the latter (*pavitreṇa śodhyamāno ‘mṛtamayaḥ somaḥ*); and  
"the sacrifice" in **d** as "the sava sacrifice now performed." The  
verse is rhythmically a *triṣṭubh* with redundant syllables (11 + 13: 12  
+ 11 = 47). ⌊On *dakṣiṇā*, see Bloomfield, AJP. xvii. 408 f.⌋

The Ox pours milk out in the world of virtue: in earliest time, he, Pavam5na, swells it. Parjanya is the stream, Maruts his udder, sacrifice is the milk, the meed his milking.
