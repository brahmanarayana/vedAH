### Translation
2. The draft-ox \[is\] Indra; he looks out from (for?) the cattle;  
triple ways the mighty one (*śakrá*) measures out (traverses?); yielding  
(*duh*) the past (? *bhūtá*), the future, existing things (*bhúvana*),  
he goes upon (*car*) all the courses (*vratá*) of the gods.

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **a** *indrasya* for *indraḥ sa*, and in **c** it adds  
*sam* before *bhūtam*, and has *bhuvanaṁ* instead of *-nā*. The comm.  
has in **b** the curious reading *stiyān* for *trayā́n*, and hence we  
lose his guess as to what may be meant by the "triple ways." He takes  
*paśubhyas* in **a** first as dative, and then as ablative. He  
understands *bhúvanā* as virtually "present"; more probably it has its  
usual sense of 'existences,' and the two preceding adjectives qualify it  
distributively, or are in apposition with it: "all existing things,  
both what is and what is to be." ⌊If we pronounce again *naḍvā́n*, the  
vs. loses its *bhurij* quality. The cadence of **b** is bad.⌋

The Bull is Indra o'er the beasts he watches. He, Sakra measures out three several pathways. He, milking out the worlds, the past, the future, discharges all the Gods' eternal duties.
