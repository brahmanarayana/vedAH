### Translation
3. He whom the (two) spheres (*krándasī*) favor when fixed; whom the  
terrified firmaments (*rodasī*) called upon; whose is yon road,  
traverser of the welkin (*rájas*)—to what god may we pay worship with  
oblation?

### Notes
The translation implies in **b** *áhvayetām*, as read by the comm., and  
by one of SPP's mss. that follows him; all the other mss., and both  
editions, have *-ethām*. The first half-verse is a damaged reflex of RV.  
6 **a, b**, with which VS. (xxxii. 7 **a, b**) and TS. agree: *yáṁ  
krándasī ávasā tastabhāné abhyāíkṣetām mánasā réjamāne;* MS. and Ppp.  
have yet another version: *yá imé dyā́vāpṛthivī́ tastabhāné* (Ppp. *-nā*)  
*ádhārayad* (Ppp. *dhāred*) *ródasī* (Ppp. *avasā*) *réjamāne*. For  
**c**, Ppp. gives *yasminn adhi vitata eti sūraḥ*, and MS. the same  
(save *sū́ra éti*); our **c** agrees most nearly with RV. 5 **c** (TS.  
and VS. xxxii. 6 the same): *yó antárikṣe rájaso vimā́naḥ*. The comm.  
apparently takes *ávatas* as *ava-tás* = *avanāt* "by his assistance  
fixed"; he offers no conjecture as to what "road" may be meant in **c**,  
but calls it simply *dyulokasthaḥ*.
