### Translation
4. \[By the greatness\] of whom the wide heaven and the great earth,  
\[by the greatness\] of whom yon wide atmosphere, by the greatness of  
whom yon sun \[is\] extended—to what god may we pay worship with  
oblation?

### Notes
The translation follows the construction as understood by the comm.; it  
might be also "whose \[is\] the wide heaven etc. etc., extended by his  
greatness." "Extended" applies better to earth etc. (**a** and **b**)  
than to sun; comm. says *vistīrṇā jātā* etc. The verse resembles only  
distantly RV. 5, with which, on the other hand, Ppp. nearly agrees,  
reading *yena dyāur ugrā pṛthivī ca dṛśa* (RV.VS.MS. *dṛḍhā́*, TS.  
*dṛḍhé*) *yena sva stabhitaṁ yena nākaṁ* (the rest -*kaḥ*): *yo  
antarikṣaṁ vimame varīyaḥ* (so MS.; the others as reported above, under  
vs. 3). Our third pāda most resembles RV. 6 **c**: *yátrā́ ’dhi sū́ra  
údito vibhā́ti* (so also VS. xxxii. 7; TS. *úditāu vyéti*). ⌊Cf. MGS. i.  
11. 14 and p. 154, *yena dyāur ugrā*.⌋ The Anukr. ignores the marked  
irregularity of **b**.
