### Translation
2. He who by his greatness became sole king of the breathing, winking  
animal creation (*jágat*); of whom immortality (*amṛ́tam*), of whom death  
\[is\] the shadow—to what god may we pay worship with oblation?

### Notes
RV.VS. (xxiii. 3) TS. rectify the meter of **b** by adding *íd* after  
*ékas;* VS. has the bad reading *nimeṣatás*. MS. gives a different  
version: *nimiṣatáś ca rā́jā pátir víśvasya jágato b-;* and Ppp. agrees  
with it, except as substituting *vidhartā* for *ca rājā*. "His shadow"  
(in **c**), the comm. says, as being dependent upon him, or under his  
control. The Anukr. passes without notice the deficiency in **b**.
