### Translation
8. The waters, generating a young (*vatsá*), set in motion (*sam-īray*)  
in the beginning an embryo; and of that, when born, the fœtal envelop  
(*úlba*) was of gold—to what god may we pay worship with oblation?

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Ppp. makes *vatsam* and *garbham* change places, and reads *īrayan;* it  
also omits the refrain, as it has done in vss. 6 and 7. GB. (i. 1. 39)  
appears to quote the pratīka with *garbham*, or in its Ppp. form ⌊as  
conjectured by Bloomfield, JAOS. xix.² 11⌋. The comm. paraphrases  
*garbhaṁ sam āirayan* by *īśvareṇa visṛṣṭaṁ vīryaṁ garbhāśayam  
prāpayan*. The verse (8 + 8: 8 + 8 + 11 = 43) is ill defined by the  
Anukr.
