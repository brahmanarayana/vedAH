### Translation
7. The golden embryo was evolved (*sam-vṛt*) in the beginning; it was,  
when born, the sole lord of existence (*bhūtá*); it maintained earth and  
heaven—to what god may we pay worship with oblation?

### Notes
As noted above, this is the first verse in the other continuous versions  
of the hymn (it is VS. xiii. 4). The others agree in reading at the end  
of **c** *pṛthivī́m dyā́m ute ’mam;* and, in addition, PB. (ix. 9. 12)  
gives *bhūtā́nām* in **b**; some of the texts contain the verse more than  
once. But Ppp. is more original, reading *hiraṇya ulvā ”sīd yo ‘gre  
vatso ajāyata: tvaṁ yo dyorvṛbhra* (?) *vaṁtyoṣpa vy apaśyad ūḍur  
mahīḥ*. The comm. understands *hiraṇyagarbha* as "the embryo of the  
golden egg." ⌊MGS., i. 10. 10, cites the hymn as one of 8 vss. and as  
beginning with *hiraṇyagarbha;* see p. 158, s.v.—Kirste, WZKM. ix. 164,  
reviewing Deussen, suggests that the golden embryo is the yolk of the  
mundane egg.⌋ The Anukr. makes no account of the deficiency of a  
syllable in **c**.
