### Translation
6. Sapless, O arrow, is thy tip; likewise thy poison is sapless; also  
thy bow, of a sapless tree, O sapless one, is sapless.

### Notes
The comm. strangely takes *arasārasam* at the end (p. *arasa: arasám*)  
as a reduplicated word, "excessively sapless."

Feeble, O Arrow, is thy shaft, thy poison, too, hath lost its strength. Made of a worthless tree, thy bow, O feeble one, is impotent.
