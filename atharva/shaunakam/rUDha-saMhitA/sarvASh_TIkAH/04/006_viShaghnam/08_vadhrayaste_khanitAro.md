### Translation
8. Impotent \[are\] thy diggers; impotent art thou, O herb; impotent  
\[is\] that rugged (*párvata*) mountain whence was born this poison.

### Notes
As was pointed out above (under iv. 4. 2), the first half-verse is a  
sort of opposite of one found in Ppp., and quoted by Kāuś. (at 40. 14).  
⌊With *párvata girí* cf. *mṛgá hastín*, xii. 1. 25.⌋
