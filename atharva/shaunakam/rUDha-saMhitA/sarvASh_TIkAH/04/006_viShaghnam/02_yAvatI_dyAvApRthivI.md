### Translation
2. As great as \[are\] heaven-and-earth by their width, as much as the  
seven rivers spread out (*vi-sthā*), \[so far\] have I spoken out from  
here these words (*vā́c*), spoilers of poison.

### Notes
*Tā́vatīm* in **d** for *tā́m itas* would be a welcome emendation. The  
first half-verse occurs in VS. (xxxviii. 26 **a, b**: not quoted in śB.)  
and TS. (in iii. 2. 6¹): VS. omits *varimṇā́;*- TS. has instead  
*mahitvā́;* both rectify the meter of **b** by adding *ca* after *yā́vat*  
(Ppp. adds instead *vā*); and for our rather fantastic *vitaṣṭhiré* (p.  
*vi॰tasthiré*) VS. has *-tasthiré* and TS. *-tasthús*. The comm. also  
reads *-sthire*; the lingualization is one of the cases falling under  
Prāt. ii. 93. The comm. glosses in **b** *sindhavas* by *samudrās*, and  
*vitasthire* by *vyāvartante*. This irregular *prastāra-pan̄kti* is  
overlooked by the Anukr. in its treatment of the meter.
