### Translation
5. Whoso sits, whoso goes about, and whoso standing looks out—of them we  
put together the eyes, just like this habitation (*harmyá*).

### Notes
RV. (vii. 55. 6) rectifies the meter of **a** by adding *ca* before  
*cárati* (the Anukr. takes no notice of the deficiency of a syllable in  
our version); its **b** is *yáś ca páśyati no jánaḥ;* and in **c** it  
has *hanmas* for *dadhmas*, and (as also Ppp.) *akṣā́ṇi*. The comm. gives  
no explanation of the obscure comparison in **d**, nor of the word  
*harmyá*, but simply says "as this *harmya* that we see is deprived of  
the faculty of sight." ⌊Is not the *tertium comparationis* simply the  
closing? We close their eyes as we close this house. The comm. renders  
*sáṁ dadhmas* by *nimīlitāni kurmas.*—For the loss of *ca* before  
*cárati*, cf. iv. 18. 6 **a** = v. 31. 11 **a** (*sá* before *śaśā́ka?*),  
and vi. 91. 2 **a** (*’va* before *vāti?*). Other cases (vii. 81. 1  
**c**, etc.) cited by Bloomfield, AJP. xvii. 418.⌋

The man who sits, the man who walks, whoever stands and clearly sees Of these we closely shut the eyes, even as we closely shut this house.
