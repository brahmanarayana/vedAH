### Translation
4. Whatever stirs have I seized; eye, breath have I seized; all the  
limbs have I seized, in the depth (*atiśarvará*) of the nights.

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **d** *uta śarvare;* the comm. explains *atiś-* by  
*tamobhūyiṣṭhe madhyarātrakāle*.

Each moving thing have I secured, have held and held the eye and breath. Each limb and member have I seized in the deep darkness of the night.
