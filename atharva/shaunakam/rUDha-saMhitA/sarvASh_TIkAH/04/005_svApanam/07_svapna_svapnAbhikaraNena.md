### Translation
7. O sleep, with the imposition (*abhikaraṇa*) of sleep do thou put to.  
sleep all the folk; till sun-up make the others sleep, till dawning let  
me be awake, like Indra, uninjured, unexhausted.

### Notes
Several of SPP's mss. have at the beginning *svápnas*. Ppp. reads  
*svapnādhik-*, and so does the comm. (explaining *adhik-* as  
*adhiṣṭkānaṁ śayyādi*); the latter has in **d** *āvyūṣam;* and Ppp.  
gives *caratāt* for *jāgṛtāt*. A *khila* to RV. vii. 55 has a  
corresponding verse, reading for **a** *svapnáḥ svapnā́dhikáraṇe* (thus  
rectifying the meter), in **c** *ā́ sūryám*, and for **d** *dvyùṣáṁ  
jāgriyād ahám*. The Anukr. uses the name *jyotis* so loosely that it is  
difficult to say precisely how it would have the verse scanned; it is  
really a *bhurij pan̄kti*.  
  
The 5 hymns of the first *anuvāka* contain 37 verses; and the old  
Anukr., taking 30 as norm, says simply *sapta*.

With soporific charm, O Sleep, lull thou to slumber all the folk. Let the rest sleep till break of day, I will remain awake till dawn, like Indra free from scath and harm.
