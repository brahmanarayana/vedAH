### Translation
2. The wind bloweth not over the earth; no one soever seeth over \[it\];  
both all the women and the dogs do thou make to sleep, going with Indra  
as companion.

### Notes
Ppp. has in **b** the preferable reading *sūryas* for *káś caná*. Part  
of our mss. (P.M.W.E.I.H.K.), with apparently all of SPP's, read  
*svāpáyas*\* at end of **c**, but both editions accept *svāpáya*, which  
the comm. also has. The comm. understands the wind to be meant as  
Indra's companion in **d**. The verse is not *bhurij*, if we read *vā́tó  
’ti* in **a**. \*⌊And so Op.⌋

Over the surface of the earth there breathes no wind, there looks. no eye. Lull all the women, lull the dogs to sleep, with Indra as thy friend!
