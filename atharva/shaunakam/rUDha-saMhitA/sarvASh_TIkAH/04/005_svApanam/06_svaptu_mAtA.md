### Translation
6. Let the mother sleep, the father sleep, the dog sleep, the  
housemaster (*viśpáti*) sleep; let the relatives (*jñātí*) of her sleep;  
let this folk round about sleep.

### Notes
For *sváptu* (5 times) and *svápantu*, RV. (vii. 55. 5) gives *sástu*  
and *sasántu;* also, in **c**, *sárve* 'all' for *asyāi* 'of her'—which  
latter is to us a welcome indication of the reason for all this putting  
to sleep, and marks the Atharvan application of the hymn, whether that  
were or were not its original intent. In **b**, all the mss. have *svā́*  
instead of *śvā́;* both editions emend to the latter, which is read also  
by the comm. ⌊For *asyāi*, cf. iii. 25. 6.⌋

Sleep mother, let the father sleep, sleep dog, and master of the home. Let all her kinsmen sleep, sleep all the people who are round about.
