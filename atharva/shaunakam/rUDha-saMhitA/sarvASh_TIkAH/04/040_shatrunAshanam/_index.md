### Comment
Not found in Pāipp. Somewhat similar formulas are met with in TB. (iii. 11. 5) and ĀpśS. (vi. 18. 3). Used in Kāuś., with ii. 11 etc., in the preparation of holy water for the counteraction of witchcraft (39. 7), and reckoned to the kṛtyāpratiharaṇa gaṇa (ib., note). *⌊The Berlin ms. of the Anukr. adds the expected aṣṭarcam.—Weber, in a footnote, p. 152, says that the remarks of the Anukr. on vs. 8 suggest that the author of the Anukr. was a Vedantist. Hence his attribution of hymns 37 and 38 to Bādarāyaṇi.⌋
