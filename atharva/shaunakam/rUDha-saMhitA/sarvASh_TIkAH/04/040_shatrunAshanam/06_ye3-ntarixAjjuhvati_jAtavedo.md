### Translation
6. They who make offering from the atmosphere, O Jātavedas, \[who\] from  
the midway (*vyadhvá*) quarter vex us—having come upon Vāyu, let them  
etc. etc.

### Notes
The comm. understands *vyadhva* as "trackless" (*vigatā adhvāno  
yasyām*). The other texts take no notice of such a quarter.

Those who pay sacrifice, O Jatavedas, from air assail us from the midway quarter. For harming Vayu be they turned and troubled! I smite them backward with mine incantation.
