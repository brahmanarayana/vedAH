### Translation
2. Ye who, accordant, thrust \[away\] the malicious; \[who\] favor the  
truthful one in conflicts; who, men-watching, go unto the brown soma—do  
ye free us from distress.

### Notes
The translation implies emendation in **c** of *babhrúṇā* (our P.M. have  
*babhrū́ṇā*\*) to *babhrúm ā́;* the comm. understands "with your brown  
chariot"; Ludwig takes the word as proper name: "pressed by Babhru."  
Ppp. has for **a** *satyojasāu dṛhvaṇī yo niredhe* ⌊cf. its version of 1  
**b**⌋, and again *haveṣu* for *bhareṣu*. The comm. (with one or two  
mss., including our Op.) reads *gacchatas* in **c**. \*⌊And W. has  
*babhrūṇā*.\]

Ye the wise Gods who drive away oppressors, ye who protect the truthful in his battles, Who come, men's guards, to juice pressed forth by Babhru,. deliver us, ye twain, from grief and trouble.
