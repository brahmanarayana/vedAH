### Translation
3. Ye who favor An̄giras, who Agasti, Jamadagni, Atri, O  
Mitra-and-Varuṇa, who favor Kaśyapa, who Vasishṭha—do ye free us from  
distress.

### Notes
The comm. reads in **a** *agastyam*. He amuses himself with worthless  
etymologies of the various names through the hymn.

Mitra and Varuna who help Agasti, Atri, and Angiras, and Jamadagni, Ye who help Kasyapa, who help Vasishtha, deliver us, ye twain, from grief and trouble.
