### Translation
4. She who delights (*pra-mud*) in the dice (*akṣá*), bringing (*bhṛ*)  
pain and anger—the rejoicing, the dehghting one: that Apsaras I call on  
here.

### Notes
The translation implies retention of *bíbhratī* at end of **b**, read by  
all the mss. and by the comm., and retained by SPP., and the emendation  
instead in **a** to *yā́ ’kṣéṣu pramódate*, which is metrically better,  
makes better connection, and has the support of the comm., with one ⌊or  
two⌋ of SPP's authorities. SPP's note to *bíbhratī*, "so read except by  
K. who follows Sāyaṇa," is unintelligible, since the latter has also  
*bíbhratī*. ⌊Delete the accent-mark under *huve.*⌋

Hither I call that Apsaras, the joyous, the delightful one-- Those nymphs who revel in the dice, who suffer grief and yield to wrath.
