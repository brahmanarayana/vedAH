### Translation
2. The distributing (*vi-ci*), on-strewing (*ā-kir*),  
successfully-playing Apsaras, that seizes (*grah*) the winnings in the  
pool—that Apsaras I call on here.

### Notes
The comm. explains the first two epithets respectively by "collecting"  
(taking *vi* as intensive) and "scattering."

Hither I call that Apsaras who scatters and who gathers up. The Apsaras who plays with skill and takes her winnings in the game.
