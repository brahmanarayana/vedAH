### Translation
6. Together with the atmosphere, O mighty one; defend thou here the  
*karkī́* calf, O vigorous one (*vājín*); here are abundant drops  
(*stoká*) for thee; come hitherward; this is thy *karkī́;* here be thy  
mind.

### Notes
The comm. reads in **a** *vājinīvān*, as in 5 **f**; in **b** he has  
*karkīn vatsān* (and one of SPP's mss. gives *karkī́n*); and, in **d**,  
*namas* instead of *manas*, and SPP. reports three of his four  
*pada*-mss. as also having *námas*. The comm. explains *karkī* as  
*karkavarṇa* or *śubhra*. The minor Pet. Lex. suggests the emendation of  
*vatsā́m* to *vaśā́m* in this verse and the next. Three of SPP's mss. and  
one of ours (O.) separate *karkī́ ihá* in *saṁhitā* in **d**. The Anukr.  
ignores the deficiency of a syllable in **b**.
