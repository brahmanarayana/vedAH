### Translation
1. The up-shooting, all-conquering, successfully-playing Apsaras, that  
wins (*kṛ*) the winnings in the pool (? *gláha*)—that Apsaras I call on  
here.

### Notes
The form *apsarā́*, instead of *apsarás*, is used throughout this hymn;  
the comm. regards it as a specialized name for the Apsaras in this  
character or office: *dyūtakriyādhidevatām apsarojātīyam*. *Udbhindatīm*  
is paraphrased by *paṇabandhena dhanasyo ’dbhedanaṁ kurvatīm*, as if it  
were the causative participle. The technical terms of the game are only  
doubtfully translated, our knowledge of its method being insufficient;  
*gláha* is taken as the receptacle, of whatever kind, in which the  
stakes are deposited; the comm. explains it thus: *gṛhyate paṇabandhena  
kalpyata iti dyūtakriyājeyo* (mss. *-jayo*) *‘rtho glahaḥ*.

Hither I call the Apsaras, victorious, who plays with skill, Her who comes freely fort to view, who wins the stakes in games of dice.
