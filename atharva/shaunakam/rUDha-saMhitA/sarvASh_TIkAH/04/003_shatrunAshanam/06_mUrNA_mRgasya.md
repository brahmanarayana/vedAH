### Translation
6. Ruined (*mūrṇá*) \[are\] the teeth of the beast (*mṛgá*); crushed in  
also \[are its\] ribs; disappearing be for thee the *godhā́;* downward go  
(*ayat*) the lurking (? *śaśayú*) beast.

### Notes
The comm. takes *mūrṇās* from *mūrch*, and renders it *mūḍhās;* in **b**  
he reads *api śīrṣṇās*, the latter being horns and the like, that grow  
"on the head." The second half-verse is extremely obscure and doubtful:  
Ludwig translates "into the depth shall the crocodile, the game go  
springing deep down"; Grill, "with lame sinew go to ruin the  
hare-hunting animal." *Ni-mruc* is used elsewhere only of the 'setting'  
of the sun etc.; the comm. renders it here "disappearing from sight";  
and he takes *śaśayu* from *śī* 'lie'; *godhā* is, without further  
explanation, "the animal of that name." The translation given follows  
the comm.; it does not seem that a "hare-hunting" animal would be worth  
guarding against. R. conjectures a figure of a bird of prey, struck in  
flight: "the sinew be thy destruction; down fall the hare-hunting bird."  
Pāda **a** lacks a syllable. ⌊W. takes *mūrṇá* from *mṛ* 'crush'; cf.  
xii. 5. 61 and *Index*.—In **a** and **b**, supply "be" rather than  
"are"?⌋
