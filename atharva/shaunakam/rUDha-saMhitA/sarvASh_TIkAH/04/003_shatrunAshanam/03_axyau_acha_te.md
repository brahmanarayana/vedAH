### Translation
3. Both thy (two) eyes and thy mouth, O tiger, we grind up; then all thy  
twenty claws (*nakhá*).

### Notes
The majority of mss. (including our Bp.I.O.Op.K.D.) read at the  
beginning *akṣāù*, as do also Ppp. and the comm., but only (as the  
accent alone suffices to show) by the ordinary omission of *y* after *ś*  
or *ṣ* both editions give *akṣyāù*. All the mss. leave *vyāghra*  
unaccented at the beginning of **b**, and SPP. retains this inadmissible  
reading; our text emends to *vyā́ghra*, but should have given instead  
*vyā̀ghra* (that is, *ví-āghra:* see Whitney's *Skt. Gr.* §314 b). Ppp.  
reads *hanū* instead of *mukham* in **a**. ⌊Anukr., London ms., has  
*akṣyāu*.⌋
