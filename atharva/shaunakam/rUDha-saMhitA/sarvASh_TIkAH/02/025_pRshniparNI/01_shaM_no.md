### Translation
1. Weal for us, woe (*áśam*) for Nirṛti ('perdition') hath the divine  
spotted-leaf made; since it is a formidable grinder-up (*-jámbhana*) of  
*káṇvas*, it, the powerful, have I used (*bhaj*).

### Notes
The comm. makes no attempt to identify the *pṛśniparṇī* as any  
particular plant, but simply paraphrases it with *citraparṇy oṣadhiḥ.*  
R. discusses the word as follows: "the *pṛśniparṇī* is, 1. according to  
the commentary to KśS. xxv. 7. 17, the same with *māṣaparṇī*, i.e.  
*Glycine debilis;* 2. according to other schol., the same with  
*lakṣmaṇā*, a plant having upon its leaves red spots, in which the form  
of a child is claimed to be seen. Bhāvapr., i. 208, calls it also  
*putrajanī*, and Rājanigh., vii. 114, *putrakandā*, or *putradā*, or  
*puṁkandā,* indicating a bulbous plant; it is credited with the power to  
cure barrenness of women; 3. according to Am. Koś. and the other  
Nighaṇṭus, it is a leguminous plant, identified by Chund Dutt (*Mat.  
medica*) with *Uraria lagopodioides Dec.*, having hairy leaves without  
colored spots. The second of these identifications would suit the hymn."  
*Abhakṣi* might mean 'I have partaken of or drunk'; but neither Kāuś.  
nor the comm. know of such a use of the plant. The strange appearance in  
this hymn (only) of *káṇva* as name of evil beings is passed by the  
comm. without a word of notice; he simply paraphrases the word with  
*pāpa.* ⌊But see Bergaigne, *Rel. véd.* ii. 465, and Hillebrandt, *Ved.  
Mythol.* i. 207.⌋ Ppp. reads in **b** *nirṛtaye karat*, and in **d**  
*tvā ’harṣam* for *abhakṣi.*

The Goddess Prisniparni hath blest us, and troubled Nirriti. Fierce crusher of the Kanvas she: her have I gained, the mighty one.
