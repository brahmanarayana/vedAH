### Comment
Found in Pāipp. ii. (with vs. 8 preceding 6 and 7, and the refrain added only to vs. 8). The hymn occurs further in TB. (ii. 5. 61-2), and parts of it in HGS. (ii. 3. 10; 4. 1). ⌊And its original structure is doubtless clearly reflected by the MP. at ii. 12. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Cf. note to our verse 2.⌋ It is, like the two next preceding, reckoned (Kāuś. 26. 1, note) to the takmanāśana gaṇa, and it is employed (27. 7) in a healing ceremony, performed at a cross-roads, while chips of kāmpīla are bound on the joints of the patient, and they or he are wetted with bunches of grass. According to the comm., the rite is intended against kṣetriya simply.
