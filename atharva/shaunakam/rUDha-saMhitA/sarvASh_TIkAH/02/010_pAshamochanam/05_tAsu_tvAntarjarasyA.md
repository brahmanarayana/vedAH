### Translation
5. Within them I set thee in old age; let the *yákṣma*, let perdition go  
forth far away: so from *kṣetriyá*, etc. etc.

### Notes
Ppp. has at the beginning *tāsv e ’daṁ jarasa ā;* TB. HGS. give *tā́sāṁ  
tvā jarása ā́;* both the latter read in **b** *nírṛtim.*

For long life, in the midst of these I set thee. Away pass Nirriti, away Consumption! From family sickness, kinsmen's curse, Destruction, from Druh, from Varuna's noose I thus release thee.
