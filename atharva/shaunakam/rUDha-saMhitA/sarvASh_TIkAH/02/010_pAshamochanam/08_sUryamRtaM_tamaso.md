### Translation
8. The gods, releasing from the seizure of darkness the sun whom it had  
befallen, let him loose from sin (*énas*): so from *kṣetriyá*, etc. etc.

### Notes
It was noticed above that the other texts add the refrain (TB. HGS.  
⌊MP.⌋ only to *pā́śāt*) only to this verse, where alone it is in place.  
Ppp. has *yathā* for *adhi* at end of **a**, and the other texts *yát;*  
**b** in Ppp. is *devā muñcantu asṛjan paretasaḥ;* in the other texts  
*devā́ ámuñcann ásṛjan vyènasaḥ.*  
  
⌊For *ṛtám*, cf. *ṛtvā́*, iv. 40. i. Most of SPP's mss. and our  
M.I.H.O.K. read *nír éņaṣaḥ.* For *énas*, W's first draft has 'evil,'  
which is better. See Lanman, *Festgruss an Roth*, pp. 187-190.—If, with  
the other texts, we drop **e, f** and omit *nírṛtyās* from **c**, we get  
a perfect meter, 12 + 12: 11 + 11. The other texts spoil the refrain by  
beginning *evám ahám imám.*⌋  
  
    
The *anuvāka* ⌊2.⌋ has again 5 hymns, with 28 verses; the quotation is  
*aṣṭa kuryād dvitīye.*

The Gods have freed from, sinfulness, redeeming the Sun, the Law from darkness and from Grahi. From family sickness, kinsmen's curse, Destruction, from Druh, from Varuna's noose I thus release thee. With spell and prayer I make thee pure and sinless: to thee be both, the Earth and Heaven, auspicious!
