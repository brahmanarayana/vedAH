### Translation
6. Thou hast been released from *yákṣma*, from difficulty (*duritá*),  
from reproach (*avadyá*); from the fetter of hatred and from seizure  
hast thou been released: so from *kṣetriyá*, etc. etc.

### Notes
Ppp. has both times *amoci* for *amukthās.* TB. likewise, and also, in  
**a, b** *ávartyāi druháḥ pā́śāṁ nírṛtyāi có ’d am-.* HGS. has neither  
this verse nor the next; that Ppp. puts our vs. 8 before it was noticed  
above. The comm. explains *avadyāt* by *jāmyādyabhiśaṅsanarūpān  
nindanāt.* ⌊TB., in comm. to Calc. ed., and in Poona ed., has  
*avartyāi.*⌋
