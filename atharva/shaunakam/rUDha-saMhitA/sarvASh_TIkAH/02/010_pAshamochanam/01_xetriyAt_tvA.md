### Translation
1. From *kṣetriyá*, from perdition, from imprecation of sisters  
(*jāmí-*), from hatred (*drúh*) do I release thee, from Varuṇa's fetter;  
free from guilt (*-ā́gas*) I make thee by \[my\] incantation; be  
heaven-and-earth both propitious to thee.

### Notes
TB. HGS. have for **a** only *kṣetriyāí tvā nírṛtyāi tvā*, in **c**  
*bráhmaṇe* and *karomi*, and in **d** *imé* instead of *stām.* Ppp. has  
at the end *-thivī ’ha bhūtām.*

From family sickness, kinsmen's curse, Destruction, from Druh, from Varuna's noose I free and save thee. With spell and prayer I make thee pure and sinless: to thee be both, the Earth and Heaven, auspicious!
