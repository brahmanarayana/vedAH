### Translation
5. Around all beings I went, the web (*tántu*) of righteousness  
stretched out for beholding, where the gods, having attained immortality  
(*amṛ́ta*) bestirred themselves (?*īraya-*) upon the same place of union  
(*yóni*).

### Notes
The proper rendering of **d** is especially doubtful, but *ádhi*, by its  
independent accent (which is established by Prāt. iv. 5), is clearly  
only a strengthener of the locative sense of *yónāu*. In **b**, perhaps  
better 'to behold the web' etc. (the comm. absurdly explains the  
particle *kám* as *sukhātmakam brahma*). The second half-verse is, as  
noted above, found in VS., TA., and Ppp., combined into one verse with  
our 3 **a, b**; Ppp. has in it *ānaśānā samāne dhāmann adhī ”rayanta;*  
VS. reads *tṛtī́ye dhā́man* for our *samāné yónāu;* TA., *tṛtī́ye dhā́māny  
abhy āírayanta.* Ppp. has as vs. 5 something quite different: for **a**,  
*pari dyāvāpṛthivī sadyā ”yam* (exchanging 4 a and 5 a: see under 4);  
for **b**, our own **b**; for **c**, d *devo devatvam abhirakṣamāṇas  
samānaṁ bandhuṁ viparicchad ekaḥ*. The first pāda requires the harsh  
resolution *vi-śu-ā* to make it full ⌊*víśvāni* would be easier⌋.

I round the circumjacent worlds have travelled to see the far- extended thread of Order. Wherein the Gods, obtaining life eternal, have risen upward to one common birthplace.
