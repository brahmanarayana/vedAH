### Translation
4. About heaven-and-earth at once I went; I approached (*upa-sthā*) the  
first-born of righteousness (*ṛtá*), abiding in beings as speech in the  
speaker; eager (?) is he; is he not Agni (fire)?

### Notes
Of this verse, only the first pāda is found in VS. (xxxii. 12 **a**) and  
TA. (x. i. 4), VS. reading *itvā́* for *āyam,* and TA. having at the end  
*yanti sadyáḥ*. Ppp. has for first half *pari viśvā bhuvanāny āyam  
upācaṣṭe prathamajā ṛtasya,* and for **d** *dhāsraṁ neṣaṇa tveṣo agniḥ.*  
The accus. *vā́cam* in **c** suggests emendation to *-ṣṭhā́m*, in  
apposition with *prathamajā́m;* but then the comm. agrees with Ppp. in  
reading instead *-jās,* and emendation without any traceable sense to  
guide us is of no avail. The combination *bhuvaneṣṭhā́* (p. *-ne॰sthā́*)  
is noted under Prāt. ii. 94. In the *pada*-text of **b** is noted from  
our mss. no other reading than *úpa:* *atiṣṭhe;* but S PP. gives *úpa:*  
*ā॰tiṣṭhe*, and reports no various readings; as *ā॰tiṣṭhe* (without any  
accent) is an impossible form ⌊*Skt. Gr.* §1083 a⌋ this is perhaps  
simply a blunder in his text; the comm., with a minority of SPP's mss.,  
has *-tiṣṭhet.*

I have gone forth around the earth and heaven, I have approached the first-born Son of Order. He, putting voice, as 'twere, within the speaker, stands in the world, he, verily is Agni.
