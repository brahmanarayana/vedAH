### Translation
4. The gods have found thy gathering (? *cītí*), the priests (*brahmán*)  
and the plants; all the gods have found thy gathering upon the earth.

### Notes
In **a**, our Bp. has *cītím*, and Op. *cītám* (both *cītím* in **c**);  
Ppp. reads *cātam* in both **a** and **c**; either word is elsewhere  
unknown. The comm. derives *cītí* either from the false root *cīv*  
'take, cover,' or from *cit* 'observe,' and fabricates his alternative  
explanations accordingly. If it comes from *ci*, there is hardly another  
example of a like formation. Ppp. has for **a** *cātaṁ te devā ’vidaṁ;*  
and, in **c, d**, *cātaṁ tebhyo tu mām avidaṁ bhū-.*

The Gods, the Brahman-priests, and plants observed the way to gather thee: All deities described the way men gather thee upon the earth.
