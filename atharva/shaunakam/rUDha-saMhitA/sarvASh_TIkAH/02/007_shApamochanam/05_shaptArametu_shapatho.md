### Translation
5. Let the curse go to the curser; our \[part\] is along with him that  
is friendly (*suhā́rd*); of the eye-conjurer (*-mántra*), the unfriendly,  
we crush in the ribs (*pṛṣṭí*).

### Notes
Nearly all our mss. (except P.M.K.), and part of SPP's, read in **b**  
*suhā́t;* many also have in **d** *pṛṣṭhī́s*, but the distinction of *ṣṭ*  
and *ṣṭh* is not clearly made in any of the mss. The comm. takes  
*cakṣus* and *mantrasya* in **c** as two independent words. ⌊See  
Griflith's note, and mine to xix. 45. 2.⌋

Upon the curser fall his curse! Dwell we with him whose heart is true! We split the cruel villain's ribs whose evil eye bewitches us.
