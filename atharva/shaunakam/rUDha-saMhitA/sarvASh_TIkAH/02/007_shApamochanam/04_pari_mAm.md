### Translation
4. Protect me about, my progeny, \[and\] what riches are ours; let not  
the niggard get the better (*tṛ*) of us; let not hostile plotters get  
the better of us.

### Notes
Our text reads at the beginning *párī ’mā́m*, with the majority of our  
mss. (only P.p.m. W.K.Kp. are noted as not doing so); but *pári mā́m*,  
which SPP. gives, and which all his authorities, as reported by him,  
support, is doubtless better, and the translation follows it. Two of our  
mss. (H.K.), with one of SPP's, give *arātir ṇo m-* in c The irregular  
meter of the verse (8 + 8: 7 + 10 = 33) is very ill described by the  
Anukr. ⌊The *avasāna* of c is put after *tārīt;* but the accent of  
*tāriṣús* marks that as the initial of **d.** RV. ix. 114. 4 suggests  
that our **c** is in disorder.⌋

Guard on all sides this woman, guard my children, us, and all our wealth! Let not malignity o'ercome, nor adversaries conquer us.
