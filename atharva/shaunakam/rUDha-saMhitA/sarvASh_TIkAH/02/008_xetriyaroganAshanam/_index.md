### Comment
Verse 1 occurs in Pāipp. i. It is reckoned (Kāuś. 26. 1, note) to the takmanāśana gaṇa, and is used in a healing ceremony (against kulāgatakuṣṭhakṣayagrahaṇyādirogās, comm.), accompanying various practices upon the diseased person, which are evidently rather adapted to the words of the text than represented by them (26. 41-27.4), and, according to the comm., are rather alternative than to be performed successively.


### Translations
Translated: Weber, xiii. 149; Ludwig, p. 513; Griffith, i. 50; Bloomfield, 13, 286.
