### Translation
2. Let this night fade away (*apa-vas*); let the bewitchers (f.,  
*abhikṛ́tvan*) fade away; let the *kṣetriyá*-effacing (*-nā́śana) plant  
fade the* kṣetriyá *away.*

### Notes
The night at time of dawn is meant, says the comm. (doubtless  
correctly). He gives two renderings of *abhikṛtvarīs:* one, from root  
*kṛ*, *abhito rogaśāntiṁ kurvāṇāḥ*, the other from *kṛt* 'cut,'  
*kartanaśīlāḥ piśācyaḥ.* According to Kāuś. the hymn accompanies a  
dousing with prepared water outside the house (? *bahis*); with this  
verse it is to be done at the end of the night.

Vanish this Night, extinct in Dawn! Let those who weave their spells depart. So let the plague-destroying Plant remove inherited disease.
