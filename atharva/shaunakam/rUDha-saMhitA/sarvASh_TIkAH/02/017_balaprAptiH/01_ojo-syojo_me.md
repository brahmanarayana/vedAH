### Translation
1. Force art thou; force mayest thou give me: hail!

### Notes
The Ppp. has no phrase corresponding to this. Some of our mss., as of  
SPP's, read *dā* instead of *dāḥ* before *svā́hā*, in this hymn and the  
next, where they do not abbreviate the repetition by omitting both  
words. The comm. regards them both as addressed to Agni, or else to the  
article offered (*hūyamānadravyam*). ⌊Cf. MGS. i. 2. 3, and p. 149 and  
citations.⌋
