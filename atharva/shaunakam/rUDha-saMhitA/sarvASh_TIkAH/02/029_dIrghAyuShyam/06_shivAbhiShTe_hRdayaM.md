### Translation
6. With propitious things (f.) I gratify thy heart; mayest thou enjoy  
thyself (*mud*) free from disease, very splendid; let the two that dwell  
together (? *savāsín*) drink this stir-about (*manthá*), putting on  
\[as\] magic the form of the (two) Aśvins.

### Notes
The second half-verse is said apparently of a married pair, who are by  
supernatural means to become as beautiful as the Aśvins. Of course, the  
comm. follows Kāuś. in understanding it of the sick and well man, and  
taking *savāsín* as "dressed in one garment." The comm. supplies  
*adbhís* in **a**, which is plausible (so Weber). Ppp. reads in **a**  
*tarpayantu*, in **b** *modamānaś care ’ha*, and in **d** *aśvināu.*  
Several of SPP's mss. give *mathám* in **c**.

With health-bestowing drops thine heart I comfort: all-bright again, and undiseased, enjoy them. Drest in like robes let these two drink the mixture, wearing the Asvins' form as an illusion.
