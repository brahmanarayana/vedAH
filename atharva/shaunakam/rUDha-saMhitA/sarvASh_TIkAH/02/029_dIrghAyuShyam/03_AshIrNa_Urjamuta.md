### Translation
3. Our blessing \[assign him\] refreshment, possession of excellent  
progeny; do ye (two), accordant, assign \[him\] dexterity, property  
(*dráviṇa*); \[let\] this man \[be\] conquering fields with power, O  
Indra, putting (*kṛ*) other rivals beneath him.

### Notes
The verse is difficult, and, as the parallel texts show, badly  
corrupted. *Āśī́r ṇas* (for which Weber ingeniously suggested *ā́śīrṇe*)  
is supported by *āśī́r nas* in MS. (iv. 12. 3) and *āśī́r me* in TS. (iii.  
2. 85) and KśS. (x. 5. 3); and all these versions give it a verb in  
**b**, *dadhātu*, instead of the impracticable dual *dhattam*, with  
which our *sácetasāu* is in the same combination. The alteration of this  
to the *sávarcasam* of TS. MS., or the *suvarcasam* of KśS. and Ppp.,  
would indicate that of *dhattam* to *-tām* (as middle), and allow sense  
to be made of the pāda. All the other texts, including Ppp., give in  
**a** *suprajāstvám* instead of the anomalous and bad *sāupr-*. TS. MS.  
KśS. have *iṣam* for *dákṣam* in **b**. The translation implies  
emendation of *jáyam* in **c** to *jáyan* in accordance with the  
*saṁjáyan* of the other texts; but Ppp. has *saṁ jayat*, which would be  
even more acceptable—only not with *ahám*, as all the four read for  
*ayám.* TS. MS., finally, combine *anyā́ṅ ádh-* in **d**; KśS. elides  
*‘nyān*. In KśS., as in Vāit., the first word is to be understood as  
*āśī́r;* the comm. interprets both ways ⌊as from *āśís* 'blessing' or  
from *āśír* 'milk'⌋. He regards the *āu* of *sāupra-* in **a** as simply  
"Vedic," and heaven and earth as addressed in **b**.

May this our prayer bring strength and goodly offspring. Give, both of you one-minded, strength and riches. Let him with might win fields and victory, Indra! setting beneath his feet the rest, his rivals.
