### Translation
1. In the sap of what is earthly, O gods, in the strength of Bhaga's  
self (*tanū́*)—length of life to this man may Agni, Sūrya—splendor may  
Brihaspati impart.

### Notes
Or it might be 'in the sap of earthly portion, in strength of body'  
(**a, b**); 'what is earthly' would refer to some characteristic product  
of earth applied in the rite; the comm. understands the god Bhaga, but  
his opinion is of no authority. As Weber suggests, the exchange of  
*āyuṣyàm* here in **c** and *ā́yus* in 2 **a** would rectify the meter of  
both verses: in neither case does the Anukr. note an irregularity. Ppp.  
has here *āyur asmāi*, but follows it with *somo varca dhātā bṛh-*. Some  
of our mss., with two or three of SPP's, accent *āyúṣyam*. The comm.  
takes *devās* in **a** for a nominative.

Gods, give him all that earth hath best with bodily strength and happy fate. Agni and Surya grant him life, Brihaspati give him eminence!
