### Translation
5. Assign refreshment to him, ye (two) that are rich in refreshment;  
assign milk to him, ye rich in milk; refreshment have heaven-and-earth  
assigned to him, \[have\] all the gods, the Maruts, refreshment \[have\]  
the waters.

### Notes
'Refreshment' is the conventional rendering selected for the ambiguous  
word *ūrj* and its varieties. Nearly all our mss. (all save P. M.), and  
all of SPP's, have the false accentuation *devās* in **d**; both  
editions emend to *devā́s*, which the comm. also understands. So also  
with *dyā́vāpṛthivī́* in **c**, for which the mss. have either  
*dyāvāpṛthivī* (so nearly all of ours and one of SPP's) or  
*dyāvāpṛthivī́* (so, according to SPP., all his save one, with our O.D.);  
only our H. has the true reading, which is given by emendation in both  
editions. The verse (10 + 10: 12 + 11 = 43) is far from being a good  
*triṣṭubh.*

Ye twain endowed with vigour, grant him vigour. Ye who are rich in milk, give milk to feed him. These twain have given him vigour, Earth and Heaven, and all the Gods, the Maruts, and the Waters.
