### Translation
1. The expeller, the bold, the container, the one-toned, the  
voracious—all the daughters (*naptī́*) of the wrathful one, the  
*sadā́nvās*, we make to disappear.

### Notes
By the connection, the obscure words in the first half-verse should be  
names of individual *sadānvās*, but *dhiṣā́ṇam* (the translation implies  
emendation to *-ṇām*) is masculine (or neuter), and *dhṛṣṇúm* (for which  
Ppp. reads *dhiṣṇyam*) not distinctively feminine. *Nissālā́* (SPP's text  
reads, with the *saṁhitā*-mss. generally, *niḥsā-:* p. *niḥ॰sālā́m*) is  
taken by the letter of the text, as if from *niḥ-sālay* = *niḥ-sāray;*  
the comm. gives first this derivation, but spoils it by adding as  
alternative "originating from the *sāla*, a kind of tree." R. suggests  
*niḥsālam* "out of the house," adverb. The comm. shamelessly derives  
*dhiṣaṇam* from *dhṛṣ*, and explains it as "a seizer with evil, so  
named"; he also takes *-vādya* as = *vacana.* All our *pada*-mss. commit  
the gross blunder of dividing *jighat॰svàm*, as if the word were a  
compound; SPP. lets the division stand in his *pada*-text. Ppp. reads in  
**c** *napatiyas.*

Forth from the hall the bold, the sharp, the greedy one, the single-voiced, Sadanvas, and all progeny of Chanda we exterminate.
