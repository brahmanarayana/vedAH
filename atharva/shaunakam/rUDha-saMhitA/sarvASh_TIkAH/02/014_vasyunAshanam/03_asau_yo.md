### Translation
3. Yon house that is below—there let the hags be; there let debility  
(*sedí*) make its home (*ni-uc*), and all the sorceresses.

### Notes
Ppp. has a different version of the first three pādas: *amuṣminn adhare  
gṛhe sarvā svaṅta rāyaḥ: tatra pāpmā ni yacchatu.* The comm. renders  
*sedi* by *nirṛti.*  
  
⌊Our accent-notation does not here distinguish a *kṣāipra* circumflex  
(*ny-ùcyantu*) from an enclitic circumflex (*sedír nyùcyantu*—as if it  
were the impossible *ni-ucyantu*, accentless); nor do the mss. of SPP.:  
but in his text, he here employs the stroke, like "long ſ" or the sign  
of integration, which does distinguish them.⌋

Yonder let the Arayis dwell, there where that house is down below. Let utter indigence and all the Yatudhanis settle there.
