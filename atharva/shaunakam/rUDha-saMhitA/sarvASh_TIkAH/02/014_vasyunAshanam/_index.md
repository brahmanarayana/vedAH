### Comment
By the connection, the obscure words in the first half-verse should be names of individual sadānvās, but dhiṣā́ṇam (the translation implies emendation to -ṇām) is masculine (or neuter), and dhṛṣṇúm (for which Ppp. reads dhiṣṇyam) not distinctively feminine. Nissālā́ (SPP's text reads, with the saṁhitā-mss. generally, niḥsā-: p. niḥ॰sālā́m) is taken by the letter of the text, as if from niḥ-sālay = niḥ-sāray; the comm. gives first this derivation, but spoils it by adding as alternative "originating from the sāla, a kind of tree." R. suggests niḥsālam "out of the house," adverb. The comm. shamelessly derives dhiṣaṇam from dhṛṣ, and explains it as "a seizer with evil, so named"; he also takes -vādya as = vacana. All our pada-mss. commit the gross blunder of dividing jighat॰svàm, as if the word were a compound; SPP. lets the division stand in his pada-text. Ppp. reads in c napatiyas.
