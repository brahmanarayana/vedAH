### Translation
2. Out of the cow-stall we drive you, out of the axle, out of the  
wagon-body (?); out of the houses we expel you, ye daughters (*duhitṛ́*)  
of *magundī*.

### Notes
The comm. understands *upānasā́t* (for which two of our mss., P.M., read  
*upamānasā́t*) to mean "a granary"—or else "a wagon full of grain"; and  
*ákṣa* "a gambling house." He does not venture to etymologize *magundī*,  
but calls it simply the name of a certain *piśācī*. The *pada*-mss. read  
*magundyā*, which SPP. properly emends to *-dyāḥ.* Ppp. has for **b**  
the corrupt *nir yoninnṛpānaca*, ⌊in **c** *magundyā*⌋, and at end of  
**d** *cātayāmasi.* The Anukr. takes notice of the metrical irregularity  
of **c**.
