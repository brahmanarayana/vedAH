### Translation
6. I have gone around the abodes (*dhāman*) of them as a swift \[steed  
about\] a race-course; I have won (*ji*) all your races (*ājí*);  
disappear from here, O *sadā́nvās.*

### Notes
The translation implies the evidently necessary emendation *asaram* at  
end of **b**; Ppp. has it, and also the comm.; both editions give  
*asaran*, with all the mss. But Ppp. agrees with the mss. in giving just  
before it the false reading *gā́ṣṭhām* for *kā́-* (our text emends, but,  
by an oversight, gives *-śúr* instead of *-śúḥ* before it); and SPP.  
retains *gā́-*. The comm. has instead *glā́ṣṭhām*, and explains it as "the  
further goal, where one stops (*sthā*) wearied (*glāna*)."

I have gone round their homes as runs a fleet-foot racer round the post, And in all races conquered you. Vanish, Sadanvas, and begone.
