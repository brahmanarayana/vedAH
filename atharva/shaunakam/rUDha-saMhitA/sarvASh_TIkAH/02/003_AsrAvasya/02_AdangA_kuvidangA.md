### Translation
2. Now then, forsooth! how then, forsooth? what hundred remedies are  
thine, of them art thou the chief (*uttamá*), free from flux, free from  
disease (*árogaṇa*).

### Notes
In **b**, me 'are mine' is an almost necessary emendation. Yet Ppp. also  
has *te:* *ād an̄gāś śataṁ yad bheṣajāni te sahasraṁ vā ca yāni te;* and,  
in **d**, *arohaṇam;* cf. also vi. 44. 2. The obscure first pāda is here  
translated as if uttered exclamatorily, perhaps accompanying some act or  
manipulation. *Āsrāva* is rendered by the indefinite term 'flux,' its  
specific meaning being uncertain; it is associated with *roga* also in  
i. 2. 4; the comm. explains it as *atīsārātimūtranāḍivraṇādi*. ⌊Cf.  
Zimmer, p. 392.⌋
