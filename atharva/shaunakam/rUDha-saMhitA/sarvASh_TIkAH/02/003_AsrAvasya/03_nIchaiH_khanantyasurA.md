### Translation
3. The Asuras dig low down this great wound-healer; that is the remedy  
of flux; that has made the disease (*róga*) disappear.

### Notes
The *pada*-text in **b** is *aruḥ॰srā́ṇam*, and the word is quoted under  
Prāt. ii. 40 as an example of the assimilation of a final *ḥ* to an  
initial sibilant; there can be no question, therefore, that the proper  
reading is *arussrā́ṇa* or *aruḥsrā́ṇa;* yet the abbreviated equivalent  
(see my *Skt. Gram.* §232 a) *arusrāṇa* is found in nearly all the mss.,  
both here and in vs. 5, and SPP. adopts it in his text. The comm. gives  
two discordant explanations of the word: *vraņasya pākasthānaṁ  
vraņamukham* ⌊'place where it gets ripe or comes to a head'?⌋, and *aruḥ  
srāyati pakvam bhavaty anetia.* At the end, the comm. has *aśīśamat* (as  
our text in 4 **d**).

The Asuras bury deep in earth this mighty thing that healeth wounds. This is the cure for morbid flow, this driveth malady away.
