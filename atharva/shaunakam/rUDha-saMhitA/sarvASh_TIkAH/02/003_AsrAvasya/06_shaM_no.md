### Translation
6. Weal be to us the waters, propitious the herbs; let Indra's  
thunderbolt smite away the demoniacs {*rakṣás*); far away let the  
discharged arrows of the demoniacs fly.

### Notes
In **a** all the mss. read apás, which SPP. rightly retains in his text;  
other examples of the use of this accusative form as nominative occur in  
the text (see the *Index Verborum*); the comm. has *āpas*, as our  
edition by emendation. We may safely regard this unmetrical "verse" as a  
later addition to the hymn; so far as regards the number of syllables  
(12: 12 + 14 = 38), it is correctly described by the Anukr., as the name  
*mahābṛhatī* is elsewhere used in the latter, but apparently by no other  
similar treatise.

Bless us the Waters! be the Plants auspicious! May Indra's thunderbolt drive off the demons. Far from us fall the shafts they shoot against us!
