### Translation
4. Let father heaven, let mother earth, in concord, make thee one that  
dies of old age; that thou mayest live in the lap of Aditi, guarded by  
breath and expiration, a hundred winters.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *ṭe* for *ṭvā* in **a**, and *dīrgham āyuḥ* for *saṁvidāne*  
in **b**; also *ṛtyā* for *adites* in **c.** The Anukr. takes no notice  
of the irregularity of the meter (9 + 11: 10 + 12 = 42: a poor  
*triṣṭubh!*); the insertion of *ca* after *pṛthivī́* in **a**, and  
emendation to *jī́vāsi* in **c**, would be easy rectifications. ⌊In order  
to bring the cesura of **a** in the right place, read *dyāúṣ* and *ṭvā.*  
each as one syllable and insert a *ca* also after *pitā́.* Thus all is  
orderly, 11 + 11: 11 + 12. The accent-mark over *pṛ-* is gone.⌋
