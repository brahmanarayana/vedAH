### Translation
1. For just thee, O old age, let this one grow; let not the other  
deaths, that are a hundred, harm him; as a forethoughtful mother in her  
lap a son, let Mitra protect him from distress that comes from a friend  
(*mitríya*).

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Ppp. has in **b** *tvat* for *śataṁ ye*, and combines in **d** *mitre  
’nam.* The omission of either *imám* or *anyé* would rectify the meter  
of **b**. The comm. most foolishly takes *jariman* first from *jṛ*  
'sing,' and explains it as *he stūyamāna agne!* then adding the true  
etymology and sense. The "jagatī" is quite irregular: 12 + 13: 11 + 12 =  
48. ⌊Bloomfield cites an admirable parallel from RV. iv. 55. 5; but in  
his version he has quite overlooked the verb-accent.⌋

This Child, Old Age! shall grow to meet thee only: none of the hundred other deaths shall harm him. From trouble caused by friends let Mitra guard him, as a kind mother guards the son she nurses.
