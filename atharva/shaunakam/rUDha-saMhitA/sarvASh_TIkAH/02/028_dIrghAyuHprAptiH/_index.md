### Comment
Found in Pāipp. (vss. 1-4 in i.; vs. 5 in xv.). Used by Kāuś. in the godāna ceremony (54. 13), as the parents pass the boy three times back and forth between them and make him eat balls of ghee; and the same is done in the cūḍā or cāula (hair-cutting) ceremony (54. 16, note); the schol. also reckon it to the āyuṣya gaṇa (54. 11, note).


### Translations
