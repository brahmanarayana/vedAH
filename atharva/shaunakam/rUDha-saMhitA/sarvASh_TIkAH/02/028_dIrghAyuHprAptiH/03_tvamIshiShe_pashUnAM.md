### Translation
3. Thou art master (*īś*) of earthly cattle, that are born, or also that  
are to be born; let not breath leave this one, nor expiration; let not  
friends slay (*vadh*) this one, nor enemies.

### Notes
All the mss., and the comm., read at end of **b** *janítrās*, which SPP.  
accordingly retains, while our text makes the necessary emendation to  
*jánitvās*, which Ppp. also has. Ppp. ⌊omits *vā* in **b**;⌋ elides the  
initial *a* of *apāno* and *amitrāḥ* after *mo;* and it puts the verse  
after our vs. 4. Pāda **b** lacks a syllable, unnoticed by the Anukr.  
⌊read *jātā́sas?*⌋.

Thou art the Lord of all terrestrial cattle, of cattle born and to be born hereafter. Let not breath drawn or breath emitted fail him. Let not his friends, let not his foemen slay him.
