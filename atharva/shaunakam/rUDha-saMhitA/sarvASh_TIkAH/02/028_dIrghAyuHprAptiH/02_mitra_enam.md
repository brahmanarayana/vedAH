### Translation
2. Let Mitra or helpful (? *riśā́dās*) Varuṇa in concord make him one  
that dies of old age; so Agni the offerer (*hótar*), knowing the ways  
(*vayúna*), bespeaks all the births of the gods.

### Notes
All our *pada*-mss. read in **a** *riśā́dā* instead of *-dāḥ;* SPP.  
properly emends to *-dāḥ.* This wholly obscure word is found  
independently only here in AV.; its rendering above is intended only to  
avoid leaving a blank; the comm. gives the ordinary etymology, as  
*hiṅsakānām attā;* Grill, emending to *ariśādas*, brings out an  
ingenious but unconvincing parallelism with Gr. ἐρικυδής and, as noticed  
by him, Aufrecht also would understand *ariśā́das* 'very prominent.' Ppp.  
reads for **a** *mitraś ca tvā varuṇaś ca riṣādāu*, and has at the end  
of **d** *-māni vakti.*

Mitra or Varuna the foe-destroyer, accordant, grant him death in course of nature! Thus Agni, Hotar-priest, skilled in high statutes, declareth all the deities' generations.
