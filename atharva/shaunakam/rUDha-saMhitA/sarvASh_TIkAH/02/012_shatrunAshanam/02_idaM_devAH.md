### Translation
2. Hear this, O ye gods that are worshipful (*yajñíya*); Bharadvāja  
sings (*śaṅs*) hymns (*ukthá*) for me; let him, bound in a fetter, be  
plunged (*ni-yuj*) in difficulty who injures this our mind.

### Notes
That is, probably, our design or intent; the comm. says  
(inappropriately) *idam púrvaṁ sanmārgapravṛttam mānasam:* i.e. seduces  
us to evil courses. All the mss. chance to agree this time in omitting  
the visarga of *yajñíyāḥ* before *sthá* in **a**. But Ppp. reads *tu*  
instead of *stha*, and in **b** *uktyāni śaṅsatu*, as it often changes  
*-ti* to *-tu;* but here the imperative (or Weber's suggested *śaṅsat*)  
would improve the sense. ⌊Pronounce *devaāḥ* and reject *sthá;* the  
meter is then in order—12 + 12: 12 + 11.⌋

Listen to this, ye Gods who merit worship. Hymns here are sung for me by Bharadvaja. Bound in the noose may he be doomed to trouble whoever mars this that our mind hath purposed.
