### Translation
1. Heaven-and-earth, the wide atmosphere, the mistress of the field, the  
wonderful wide-going one, and the wide wind-guarded atmosphere—let these  
be inflamed (*tapya-*) here while I am inflamed.

### Notes
All the *pada*-mss. read at the end *tapyámāne íti*, as if the word were  
a dual fem. or neut.: a most gratuitous blunder; SPP's *pada*-text  
emends to *-ne.* Ppp. reads in **d** *teṣu* for *tá ihá* (which is, as  
in not infrequent other cases, to be contracted to *té ’há;* the Anukr.  
at least takes no notice of the irregularity here; but it also ignores  
the *jagatī* value of **b**). The comm. naturally explains the  
"wide-goer" as Vishṇu; he does not attempt to account for the mention of  
"the wide atmosphere" twice in the verse, though sometimes giving  
himself much trouble to excuse such a repetition. The last pāda he  
paraphrases by "just as I am endeavoring to destroy the hateful one, so  
may they also be injurers of \[my\] enemy, by not giving him place and  
the like": which is doubtless the general meaning.

The spacious Firmament, and Earth and Heaven, the Field's Queen, and the wonderful Wide-Strider, Yea, the broad middle air which Vata guardeth, may these now burn with heat while I am burning.
