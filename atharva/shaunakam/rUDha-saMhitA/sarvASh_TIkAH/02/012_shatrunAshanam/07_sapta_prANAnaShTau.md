### Translation
7. Seven breaths, eight marrows: them I hew \[off\] for thee with \[my\]  
incantation; thou shalt go to Yama's seat, messengered by Agni, made  
satisfactory.

### Notes
The last pāda is xviii. 2. 1 (RV. x. 14. 13) **d**. All our mss. and  
about half of SPP's have in **a** *majñás* (for *majjñás*); yet SPP.  
adopts in his text the reading *manyás*, because given by the comm.,  
which explains it artificially as for *dhamanyas*, and signifying "a  
sort of vessels situated in the throat"; no such word appears to be  
known elsewhere in the language, and some of the mss. have in other  
passages of the text *manyas* for *majñás*. Our Bp. gives *áyā* at  
beginning of **c**; the word is translated above as ⌊*áyās*⌋,  
subjunctive of *i* with doubled subjunctive-sign (see my *Skt. Gram.*  
§560 e), or of its secondary root-form *ay*; the comm. takes it from  
*yā*, which makes him no difficulty, since in his view imperfect and  
imperative are equivalent, and he declares it used for *yāhi*. Ppp.  
reads for **c** *yamasya gacha sādanam.* ⌊In many parts of India today  
*jñ* and *ny* are phonetically equivalent. Cf. SPP's mss. for ix. 5.  
23.⌋

Thy sevenfold vital breath, thine eight marrows I rend away with prayer. With Agni as thine envoy, go, prepared, to Yama's dwelling place.
