### Translation
5. O heaven-and-earth, attend (*ā-dīdhī*) ye after me; O all ye gods,  
take ye hold (*ā-rabh*) after me; O Angirases, Fathers, soma-feasting  
(*somyá*), let the doer of abhorrence (*apakāmá*) meet with (*ā-ṛ*)  
evil.

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **a** *dīdhyatām* ⌊cf. Bloomfield, AJP. xvii. 417⌋, and in  
**d** *pāpasāricchetv ap-*. The comm. does not recognize *dīdhī* as  
different from *dīdī*, rendering *ādīpte bhavatam.* ⌊In **a**, the  
accent-mark under *-vī* is missing.⌋

O Heaven and Earth, regard me with your favour, and, all ye Gods, stand on my side and help me. Angirases, Fathers worthy of the Soma! woe fall on him who, caused the hateful outrage!
