### Translation
4. With thrice eighty *sā́man*-singers, with the Ādityas, the Vasus, the  
Angirases—let what is sacrificed-and-bestowed of the Fathers aid us—I  
take yon man with seizure (*háras*) of the gods.

### Notes
*Iṣṭapūrtám* in **c** has probably already the later meaning of merit  
obtained by such sacred acts; the comm. says *tadubhayajanitaṁ sukṛtam.*  
*Haras* he calls a *krodhanāman.* He understands the 'three eighties' of  
**a** to be the triplets (*tṛca*) in *gāyatrī*, *uṣṇih*, and *bṛhatī*,  
eighty of each, spoken of in AA. i. 4. 3—simply because they are the  
only such groups that he finds mentioned elsewhere; the number is  
probably taken indefinitely, as an imposing one.

Together with thrice-eighty Sama-singers, Angirases, and Vasus, and Adityas, May the felicity of the Fathers guard us. I seize that man with fire that Gods have kindled.
