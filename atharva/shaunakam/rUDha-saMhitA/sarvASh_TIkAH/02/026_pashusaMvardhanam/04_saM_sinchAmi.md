### Translation
4. I pour together the milk (*kṣīrá*) of kine, together strength, sap,  
with sacrificial butter; poured together are our heroes; fixed are the  
kine in me ⌊rather, with me⌋ \[as\] kine-lord.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *valam* in **b**, combines *-ktā ’smākam* in **c**, and has  
for **d** *mayi gāvaś ca gopatāu.* The redundant syllable in **d**  
(noticed by the Anukr.) would be got rid of by changing *máyi* to the  
old locative *mé*⌊; but with better metrical result, by adopting the  
Ppp. reading⌋. With the second half-verse is to be compared AśS. iii. 11  
. 6: *ariṣṭā asmākaṁ vīrā mayi gāvaḥ santu gopatāu.* The comm. says that  
*gavām* in **a** means *gṛṣṭīnām* 'of heifers (having their first  
calf).'

I pour together milk of kine, with butter blending strength and juice. Well sprinkled be our men, as true to me as cows are to their herd!
