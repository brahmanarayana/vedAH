### Translation
1. Hither let the cattle come that went away, whose companionship  
(*sahacārá*) Vāyu (the wind) enjoyed, whose form-givings Tvashṭar knows;  
in this cow-stall let Savitar make them fast (*ni-yam*).

### Notes
Or, 'whose forms,' *rūpadheya* being virtually equivalent to simple  
*rūpa.* Ppp. reads in **b** *sahatāram.* The "cow-stall" does not  
probably imply anything more than an enclosure. The Anukr. passes  
without notice the *jagatī* pāda **d.**

Let them come home, the cattle that have wandered, whom Vayu hath delighted to attend on, Whose forms and figures are well known to Tvashtar. These cows let Savitar drive within this stable.
