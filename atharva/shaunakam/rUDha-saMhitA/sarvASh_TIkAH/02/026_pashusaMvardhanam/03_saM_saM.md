### Translation
3. Together, together let cattle flow ⌊stream⌋, together horses, and  
together men, together the fatness that is of grain; I offer with an  
oblation of confluence.

### Notes
For the oblation called 'of confluence,' to effect the streaming  
together of good things, compare i. 15 and xix. 1. The change of meter  
in .this hymn need not damage its unity, in view of its occurrence as  
one hymn in Ppp. Ppp. reads in **b** *pāuruṣās,* and in **c**  
*sphātibhis* (for *yā sph-*). The metrical definition of the Anukr.  
seems to reject the obvious resolution *-vi-e-ṇa* in **d.**
