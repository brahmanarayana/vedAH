### Translation
5. Hither hath this woman come, desiring a husband; desiring a wife have  
I come; like a loud-neighing (*krand*) horse, together with fortune have  
I come.

### Notes
That is, perhaps, 'I have enjoyed her favors.' None of the mss. fail to  
accent *yáthā* in **c.**

Seeking a husband she hath come! and I came longing for a wife: Even as a loudly-neighing steed may fate and fortune have I met.
