### Translation
 4. What \[was\] within, \[be\] that without; what \[was\] without,  
\[be\] that within; of the maidens of many forms seize thou the mind, O  
herb.

### Notes
In the obscure formalism of **a, b** the comm. thinks mind and speech to  
be intended. ⌊Why not *rétas* and *śépas?*⌋ 'Of all forms,' i.e., as  
often elsewhere, 'of every sort and kind.' ⌊Ppp. reads *abāhyaṁ* for  
*bāhyaṁ yad bāhyaṁ.*⌋

Let what is inward turn outside, let what is outward be within: Seize and possess, O Plant, the mind of maidens rich in every charm.
