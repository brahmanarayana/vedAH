### Translation
1. As the wind here shakes the grass off the earth, so do I shake thy  
mind, that thou mayest be one loving me, that thou mayest be one not  
going away from me.

### Notes
The last half-verse is the same with the concluding pādas of i. 34. 5  
and vi. 8. 1-3; SPP. again alters the *pada*-text to *ápa॰gāḥ* (see  
under i. 34. 5); Ppp. has here for **e** *evā mama tvāyasī.* Ppp. reads  
in **a, b** *bhūmyā ’dhi vatas* (!) *tṛ-.* We should expect in **a**  
rather *bhū́myām*, and this the comm. reads, both in his exposition and  
in his quotation of the pratīka from Kāuś.; but Bloomfield gives no such  
variant in his edition.

As the wind shake this Tuft of Grass hither and thither on the ground. So do I stir and shake thy mind, that thou mayst be in love with me, my darling, never to depart.
