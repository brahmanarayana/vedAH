### Translation
1. O breath-and-expiration, protect me from death: hail (*svā́hā*)!

### Notes
The first extension of the notion of *prāṇa* 'breath,' lit.  
'forth-breathing,' is by addition of *apāna*, which also is lit.  
'breathing away,' and so, when distinguished from the generalized  
*prāṇa*, seems to mean 'expiration.' The comm. here defines the two  
thus: *prāg ūrdhvamukho ‘niti ceṣṭata iti prāṇaḥ; apā ’nity avān̄mukhaś  
ceṣṭata ity apānaḥ.* For *svāhā* he gives alternative explanations,  
following Yāska. The verse (without *svāhā*) is found also in Āp. xiv.  
19.3. "*Triṣṭubh*" in the Anukr. is doubtless a misreading for *pan̄kti*,  
as the verse has 1 1 syllables, and 1 and 3 would have been defined  
together if viewed as of the same meter.
