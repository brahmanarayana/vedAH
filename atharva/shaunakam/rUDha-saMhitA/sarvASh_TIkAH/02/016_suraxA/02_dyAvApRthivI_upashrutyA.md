### Translation
2. O heaven-and-earth, protect me by listening (*úpaśruti*): hail!

### Notes
The *pada*-mss. read úpa॰śrutyā (not *-yāḥ*), and, in the obscurity of  
the prayer, it is perhaps best to follow them ⌊'by overhearing' the  
plans of my enemies?⌋; otherwise, 'from being overheard' ⌊by my  
enemies?⌋ would seem as suitable; and this is rather suggested by the  
Ppp. reading, *upaśrute* (for *-teḥ?*).  
  
Ppp. has after this another verse: *dhanāyā ”yuṣe prajāyāi mā pātaṁ  
svāhā.*
