### Translation
5. O all-bearing one, protect me with all bearing (*bháras*): hail!

### Notes
The sense is obscure; at xii. 1. 6 the epithet 'all-bearing' is, very  
properly, applied to the earth; but here the word is masculine. The  
comm. understands Agni to be meant (and this the Ppp. reading favors);  
but he relies for this solely on BAU. i. 4. 7  (which he quotes); and  
that is certainly not its meaning there. Weber conjectures Prajāpati.  
⌊The BAU. passage is i. 4. 16 in Böhtlingk's ed. See Whitney's criticism  
upon it at AJP. xi. 432. I think nevertheless that fire may be meant—see  
Deussen's *Sechzig Upanishad's*, p. 394.⌋ It does not appear why the  
last two verses should be called of two pādas.
