### Translation
1. The great mill-stone that is Indra's, bruiser (*tárhaṇa*) of every  
worm—with that I mash (*piṣ*) together the worms, as *khálva*-grains  
with a mill-stone.

### Notes
Our mss. and those of SPP., as well as Ppp., vary, in this hymn and  
elsewhere, quite indiscriminately between *krími* and *kṛ́mi*, so that it  
is not at all worth while to report the details; SPP. agrees with us in  
printing everywhere *krími*. Two of our mss. (O. Op.), with one of  
SPP's, read *dhṛṣát* in **a**. Ppp. gives at the end *khalvān̄ iva.* The  
comm. explains *krimīn* by *śarīrāntargatān sarvān kṣudrajantūn.*

With Indra's mighty millstone, that which crushes worms of every sort, I bray and bruise the worms to bits like vetches on the grinding stone.
