### Translation
4. The one along the entrails, the one in the head, likewise the worm in  
the ribs, the *avaskavá*, the *vyadhvará*—the worms we grind up with our  
spell (*vácas*).

### Notes
The comm., and two of SPP's mss., read in **b** *pā́rṣṇeyam* 'in the  
heel'; and SPP. admits into his text after it *krímīn*, against the  
great majority of his mss. and against the comm.; none of ours have it,  
but three (O. Op. Kp.) give *krímīm*, which looks like an abortive  
attempt at it. For *vyadhvaram* in **c**, Ppp. has *yaraṁ;* all the mss.  
have *vyadhvarám;* unless it is to be emended to *vyadvarám* (cf. vi.  
50. 3, note), it must probably be derived from *vyadh* 'pierce'; but the  
*pada*-reading *vi॰adhvarám* points rather to *vi-adhvan;* the comm.  
takes it from the latter, and also, alternatively, from *vi* and  
*a-dhvara;* *avaskavá* is, according to him, *avāggamanasvabhava;* it  
seems rather to come from √*sku* 'tear.' The expression *prāgukta* 'as  
heretofore defined' is not used elsewhere in the Anukr.; it is used by  
abbreviation for *upariṣṭādvirāḍ* (vs. 2); but why the two verses were  
not defined together, to make repetition needless, does not appear. ⌊in  
**d**, again, *krímīn* is a palpable intrusion.⌋

The worm that lives within the ribs, within the bowels, in the head. Avaskava and Borer, these we bruise to pieces with the spell.
