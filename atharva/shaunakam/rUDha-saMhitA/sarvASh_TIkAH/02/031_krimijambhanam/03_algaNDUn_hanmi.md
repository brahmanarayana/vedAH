### Translation
3. I smite the *algáṇḍus* with a great deadly weapon; burnt \[or\]  
unburnt, they have become sapless; those left \[or\] not left I draw  
down by my spell (*vā́c*), that no one of the worms be left.

### Notes
It seems hardly possible to avoid amending at the end to *uchiṣyā́tāi*,  
passive. Ppp. reads in **b** *dunāddunā*, and its last half-verse is  
defaced.

I kill Alandus with a mighty weapon: burnt or not burnt they now have lost their vigour . Left or not left, I with the spell subdue them: let not a single worm remain uninjured.
