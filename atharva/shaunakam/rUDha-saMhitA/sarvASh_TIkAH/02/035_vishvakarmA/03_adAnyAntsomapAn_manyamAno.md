### Translation
3. Thinking the soma-drinkers to be unworthy of gifts (? *adānyá*),  
\[though\] knowing of the sacrifice, \[he is\] not wise (*dhī́ra*) in the  
conjuncture (*samayá*); in that this man is bound having committed a  
sin, do thou, O Viśvakarman, release him for his well-being.

### Notes
The offense here had in view is far from clear. Instead of *adānyá*  
(which occurs only here), TS. has the apparently unintelligent  
*ananyā́n;* MS. reads *ayajñiyā́ṅ yajñíyān mány-* 'thinking the unfit for  
offering to be fit for offering' (or vice versa); both have in **b**  
*prāṇásya* for *yajñásya*, and *samaré* for *-yé*. Ppp. gives the second  
half-verse as 2 **c, d**, and ends it with *pra mumugdhy enaṁ*. TS. MS.  
have no *yát* at beginning of **c**; TS. gives *énaś cakṛvā́n máhi*, and  
MS. *éno mahác cakṛvā́n b-*, and TS. *eṣām* for *eṣá*. The comm. explains  
*adānyān* as *ajñatvāropeṇa dānānarhān*, takes *na* in **b** as particle  
of comparison, and makes *samaya* equal *saṁgrāma:* "as if one by  
confidence in the strength of his own arm should think the opposing  
soldiers despicable"! The verse (11 + 11: 10 + 12 = 44) has marked  
irregularities which the Anukr. ignores.

Regarding niggard churls as Soma-drinkers, skilful in sacrifice, weak at the meeting, Whatever sin the captive hath committed, do thou for weal release him, Visvakarman!
