### Translation
1. They who, partaking \[of soma\] (*bhakṣ*), did not prosper (*ṛdh*) in  
good things, whom the fires of the sacrificial hearth were distressed  
about (*anu-tapya-*)—what was the expiation (*avayá*) of their  
ill-sacrifice, may Viśvakarman ('the all-worker') make that for us a  
good sacrifice.

### Notes
The translation implies emendation of *dúriṣṭis* in **c** to *-ṭes*, and  
of *tā́n* in **d** to *tā́m;* *tā́m* is read by the comm., as well as by  
TS. and MS., and SPP. even admits it into his text, though nearly all  
his mss., as well as ours, read *tā́n*. Our P. and M. read *āvṛdhús* at  
end of **a**; TS. has *ānṛhús*, MS. *ānaśús.* TS. elides the *a* of  
*anu* in **b**; it begins **c** with *iyám* for *yā́*, and ends it with  
*dúriṣṭyāi*, thus supporting our emendation. Both TS. and MS. give  
*kṛṇotu* in **d**, and MS. puts it after *viśvákarmā.* The *pada-*mss.  
read in **c** *ava॰yā́*, but SPP. alters his *pada*-text to *ava-yā́ḥ*, on  
the authority of the comm.; it is a matter of indifference, as the  
concluding element, in spite of the native grammarians, is doubtless the  
root *yā.* Ppp. gives *duriṣṭā sviṣṭam* in **c, d**. The various  
readings, here and in the following verses, are in good part of the kind  
which show that the text-makers were fumbling over matter which they did  
not understand. The comm. is no better off. Here, in **a**, he is  
uncertain whether to take *ná* as 'as if' or 'not,' and to make *vásūni*  
object of *bhakṣáyantas* or of *ānṛdhús* (= *vardhitavantas*, which is  
not bad). ⌊The fires, pāda **b**, are personified in like fashion at  
AGS. iv. 1. 2, 3.⌋ The verse (12 + 12: 9 + 11 = 44) is much more  
irregular than the definition of the Anukr. admits.

We who enjoying it have grown no richer, for whom the sacred altar-fires have sorrowed, We who compounded with deficient worship,--may Visvakarman make our service prosper.
