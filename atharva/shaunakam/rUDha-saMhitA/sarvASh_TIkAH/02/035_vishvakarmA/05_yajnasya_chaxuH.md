### Translation
5. The sacrifice's eye, commencement, and face: with voice, hearing,  
mind I make oblation. To this sacrifice, extended by Viśvakarman, let  
the gods come, well-willing.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The verse is found in no other text, and is perhaps not a proper part of  
the hymn; it is repeated below as xix. 58. 5. A few of the  
*saṁhitā*-mss. (including our O.) ignore the *ā́* at beginning of **d**.  
The comm. is not certain whether the three nominatives in **a**  
designate Agni or sacrificial butter; but he has no scruple about making  
them objects to *juhomi.*

The eye of sacrifice, source, and beginning--with voice, ear, spirit unto him I offer. To this our sacrifice wrought by Visvakarman may the Gods come gracious and kindly-hearted.
