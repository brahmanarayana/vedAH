### Translation
7. Here \[is\] gold, bdellium; here \[is\] *āukṣá*, likewise fortune;  
these have given thee unto husbands, in order to find one according to  
thy wish.

### Notes
*Āukṣá* (cf. *āukṣagandhi*, iv. 37. 3) seems to be some fragrant product  
of the ox; or it may perhaps come from *ukṣ* 'sprinkle,' but not through  
*ukṣan*. The mss. vary here, as everywhere else, in an indiscriminate  
manner between *gúggulu* and *gúlgulu;* here the majority of ours have  
*-lg-*, and the great majority of SPP's have *-gg-;* but *-gg-* is  
accepted (as elsewhere) in our edition, and *-lg-* in the other; Ppp.  
reads *-lg-*, the comm. *-gg-*. Ppp. has further *vayam ukṣo atho  
bhaga;* and, in **c-d**, *adhuḥ patik-*. The comm. defines *guggulu* as  
"a well-known kind of article for incense," and for *āukṣa* he quotes  
from Keśava (*kāuśikasūtrabhāṣyakārās*) the couplet given in  
Bloomfield's Kāuśika on p. 335 (but reading *surabhīn gandhān kṣīraṁ*).  
The comm., p. 332, explains that with this verse is to be performed a  
binding on and fumigation and anointing of the girl with ornaments,  
bdellium, and *āukṣa* respectively. ⌊BR., iv. 947, suggests  
*pratikāmyā̀ya*.⌋
