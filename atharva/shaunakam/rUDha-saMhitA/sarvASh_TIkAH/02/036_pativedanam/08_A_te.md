### Translation
8. Hither let Savitar conduct for thee, conduct a husband that is  
according to thy wish; do thou assign \[him\] to her, O herb.

### Notes
The second *nayatu* is a detriment equally to sense and to meter; the  
Anukr. counts it to **a**, and the *pada*-mss. mark the division  
accordingly. Emendation of *tvám* in **c** to *tám* is strongly  
suggested. The verse hardly belongs to the hymn as originally made up;  
there has been no reference elsewhere to an "herb"; nor does Kāuś.  
introduce such an element.  
  
In the concluding *anuvāka* ⌊6.⌋ are 5 hymns, 31 verses: the Anukr. says  
accordingly *triṅśadekādhiko ‘ntyaḥ.*  
  
This is the end also of the fourth *prapāṭhaka.*  
  
⌊One or two mss. sum up the book as 36 hymns and 207 verses.⌋

May Savitar lead and bring to thee the husband whom thy heart desires. O Plant, be this thy gift to her!
