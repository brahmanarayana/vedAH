### Comment
Found (except vss. 6,8) in Pāipp. ii. (in the verse-order 1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 7). Used by Kāuś. (34. 13 ff.) among the women's rites, in a ceremony for obtaining a husband; vss. 5 and 7 are specially referred to or quoted, with rites adapted to the text. It is further regarded by the schol. and the comm. as signified by pativedana (75. 7), at the beginning of the chapters on nuptial rites, accompanying the sending out of a wooer or paranymph.
