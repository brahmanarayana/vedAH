### Translation
5. Ascend thou the boat of Bhaga, full, unfailing; with that cause to  
cross over hither a suitor who is according to thy wish.

### Notes
Or *pratikāmyà* may perhaps mean 'responsive to thy love.' Ppp. has in  
**a** *ā ruha*, in **b** *anuparas-*, and for **c, d** *trayo pūṣā hitaṁ  
yaṣ patiṣ patikāmyaḥ.* The comm. understands *upa-* in **c** as an  
independent word. With this verse, according to the comm., the girl is  
made to ascend a properly prepared boat.
