### Translation
1. O *śerabhaka, śerabha!* back again let your familiar demons go; back  
again your missile, ye *kimīdíns!* whose ye are, him eat ye; who hath  
sent you forth, him eat ye; eat your own flesh.

### Notes
Ppp. reads: *śarabhaka ṣeraśabha punar bho yānti yādavaṣ punar hatiṣ  
kimīdinaḥ yasya stha dam atta yo va prāhī tam uttam māsāṅsa manyatā.*  
The comm. in the last phrase gives *sā* instead of *svā* and has much  
trouble to fabricate an explanation for it (as = *tasya,* or else for  
*sā hetiḥ*). *śerabhaka* he takes as either *sukhasya prāpaka* or  
*śarabhavat sarveṣām hiṅsaka,* but is confident that it designates a  
"chief of *yātudhānas.*" Of the refrain, the first part seems metrical,  
and the second prose, in three phrases; and it may be counted as 8 + 8:  
6 + 7 + 5 (or 7) = 34 (or 36): the prefixed names add 7 syllables (vss.  
1, 2), or 5 (vss. 3, 4), or 3 (vss. 6-8), or 2 (vs. 5). ⌊Bloomfield  
comments on *áhāit* and the like, ZDMG. xlviii. 577.⌋
