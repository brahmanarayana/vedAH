### Translation
8. O *bharūjī!* back again. let your familiar etc. etc.

### Notes
To represent all these verses, we find in Ppp. *śevṛka śevṛdha sarpān  
sarpa mrokān mro jyarṇyatro jarjūnvapaprado punar vo yanti yādavaḥ:  
punar jūtiṣ kimīdinaḥ yasya stha dam atta yo na prāhi tam utvas sā  
māṅsāṇy attā.* It has not seemed worth while to try to translate the  
names, though most of them contain intelligible elements ⌊see Weber, p.  
184, 186⌋, and the comm. forces through worthless explanations for them  
all. In vs. 8 he reads *bharūci,* and makes an absurd derivation from  
roots *bhṛ* and *añc* ("going to take away the body"). ⌊In the first  
draft, W. notes that the four feminine names of vss. 5-8 might be  
combined to one *triṣṭubh* pāda, which with the common refrain would  
give us the normal five "verses."⌋

Back, O, Bharuji! fall your charms, your weapon, ye Kimidinis. Eat your possessor; eat ye him who sent you forth; eat your own flesh.
