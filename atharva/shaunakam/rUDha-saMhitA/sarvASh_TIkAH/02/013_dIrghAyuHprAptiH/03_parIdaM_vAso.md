### Translation
3. Thou hast put about thee this garment in order to well-being; thou  
hast become protector of the people (?) against imprecation; both do  
thou live a hundred numerous autumns, and do thou gather about thee  
abundance of wealth.

### Notes
The translation implies emendation of *gṛṣṭīnā́m* in **b** to *kṛṣṭīnā́m*,  
as given by Ppp. and by PGS. (i. 4. 12) and HGS. (i. 4. 2) in a  
corresponding expression to xix. 24.5 below. ⌊MP., ii. 2. 8, reads  
*āpīnā́m*.⌋ Such blundering exchanges of surd and sonant are found here  
and there; another is found below, in 14. 6 **b** ⌊so our ii. 5. 4,  
Ppp.⌋. All the mss., and both editions, read here *gṛṣ-*, and the comm.  
explains it by *gavām*, and, with absurd ingenuity, makes it apply to  
the asserted fear of kine, on seeing a naked man, that he is going to  
take from them the skin which formerly belonged to him, but was given to  
them instead by the gods; the legend is first given in the words of the  
comm. himself, and then quoted from śB. iii. 1. 2. 13-17. For comparison  
of the Sūtra-texts in detail, see under xix. 24. 5, 6. In **c**, our O.  
Op. read *jī́vas*. ⌊Cf. MGS. i. 9. 27 *a* and p. 152, s.v. *paridhāsye.*  
With **c, d** cf. PGS. ii. 6. 20.⌋ The first pāda is properly *jagatī*  
(*su-astáye*).  
  
⌊☞ See p. 1045.⌋

Thou for our w eal hast clothed thee in the mantle: thou hast become our heifers' guard from witchcraft. Live thou a hundred full and plenteous autumns, and wrap thee in prosperity of riches.
