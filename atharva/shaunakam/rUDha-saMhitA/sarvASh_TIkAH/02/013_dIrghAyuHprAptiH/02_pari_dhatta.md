### Translation
2. Envelop, put ye him for us with splendor; make ye him one to die of  
old age; \[make\] long life; Brihaspati furnished (*pra-yam*) this  
garment unto king Soma for enveloping \[himself\].

### Notes
The verse is repeated below, as xix. 24. 4. It is found also in HGS. (i.  
4. 2) ⌊MP. ii. 2. 6⌋, and **a, b** in MB. (i. 1. 6). HGS. in **a** omits  
*nas*, and reads *vāsasāi ’nam* for *varcase ’mam*, and in **b** it has  
*śatāyuṣam* for *jarāmṛtyum;* MB. agrees with this, only making the  
verse apply to a girl by giving *enām* and *śatāyuṣīm.* There appears to  
be a mixture of constructions in **a**: *pári dhatta várcasā* is right,  
but *dhattá* requires rather *várcase*. Emending to *kṛṇutá* would  
enable *jarā́mṛtyum* to be construed with *imam* in **a** ⌊; but cf. ii.  
28. 2⌋. Verses 2 and 3 are apparently lost out of Ppp., not originally  
wanting.

For us surround him, cover him with splendour, give him long life, and death when age removes him. The garment hath Brihaspati presented to Soma, to the King, to w rap about him.
