### Translation
 6. Witchcraft-spoiling is this amulet, likewise niggard-spoiling;  
likewise shall the pov/eriul *jan̄giḍá* prolong our life-times.

### Notes
The absence of this verse in Ppp. indicates that the hymn originally  
consisted of five verses, in accordance with the norm of the book. The  
verse is very nearly xix. 34. 4. Emendation to *arātidū́ṣaṇas* (as in  
xix.) in **b** would rectify the meter; the Anukr. takes no notice of  
its irregularity. At the end, two of our mss. (E.I.) and three of SPP's  
read *tārṣat.* ⌊For his *sáhasvān*, see note to i. 19. 4.⌋
