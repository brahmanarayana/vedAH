### Translation
5. Let both the hemp and the *jan̄giḍá* defend me from the *víṣkandha*:  
the one brought from the forest, the other from the juices (*rása*) of  
ploughing.

### Notes
That is, from cultivated ground. The "hemp" is doubtless, as the comm.  
defines it, that of the string by which the amulet is bound on. Ppp. has  
at the beginning *khanaś ca tvā ja-;* and its second half-verse is  
corrupted into *araṇyād abhy ābhṛtaṣ kṛṣyā ’nyo rasebhyaḥ.*

May Cannabis and Jangida preserve me from Vishkandha,-- that Brought to us from the forest, this sprung from the saps of husbandry.
