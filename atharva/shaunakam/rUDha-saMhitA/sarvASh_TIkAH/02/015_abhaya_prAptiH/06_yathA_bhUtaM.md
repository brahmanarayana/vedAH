### Translation
6. As both what is (*bhūtá*) and what is to be (*bhávya*) do not fear  
etc. etc.

### Notes
The comm. paraphrases *bhūtám* by *sattām prāptaṁ vastujātam;* the past  
would seem to be a better example of fixity than the future; but neither  
is "untruth" (vs. 5) to be commended as an example. ⌊Weber would read  
*ca ṛtám.*⌋
