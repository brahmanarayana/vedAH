### Translation
2. *Sraktyà*. art thou; re-entrant (*pratisará*) art thou;  
counter-conjuring art thou: attain the etc. etc.

### Notes
The comm. says that *srakti* is the *tilaka*-tree, and *sraktya* means  
made from it; *pratisara* is something by which sorceries are turned  
back (upon their performer); it seems to mean virtually a circular  
amulet—⌊such as a bracelet? For *re-entrant*, Whitney has interlined  
*revertent* (sic), better, perhaps, *reverting*, trans, or intrans.⌋.
