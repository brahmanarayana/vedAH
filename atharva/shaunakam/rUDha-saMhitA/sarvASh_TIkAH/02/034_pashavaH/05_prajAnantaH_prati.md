### Translation
5. Foreknowing, let them first (*pū́rva*) receive the breath (*prāṇá*)  
coming to \[them\] forth from the limbs. Go to heaven; stand firm with  
thy bodies; go to paradise (*svargá*) by god-traveled roads.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Ppp. has *devās* for *pūrve* in **a**, *tābhyām* for *divam* in **c**,  
and at the end *-bhiś śivebhiḥ.* TS. reads *gṛhṇanti* in **a**; and TS.  
K. MS. (ii. 5. 10 **c, d**) invert the order of **c** and **d**, and  
give the better reading *óṣadhīṣu* for *dívaṁ gacha* ⌊cf. RV. x. 16. 3⌋;  
MS. also has *hutás* for *svargam.* The comm. makes *pūrve* mean "the  
gods previously stationed in the atmosphere"; perhaps it is 'before the  
demons get hold of it.'

Let those who know receive before all others the vital breath proceeding from the body. Go to the sky. Stay there with all thy members. By paths which Gods have travelled go to Svarga.
