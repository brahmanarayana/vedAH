### Translation
2. Do ye, releasing (*pra-muc*) the seed of being, assign progress  
(*gātú*) to the sacrificer, O gods; what hath stood brought hither  
(*upákṛta*), strenuous (*śaśamāná*), let it go upon the dear path of the  
gods.

### Notes
TS. (and K.?) rectifies the meter of **a** (whose irregularity the  
Anukr. ignores) by reading *pramuñcámānās;* it also has *jīvám* for  
*priyám* in **d**. Ppp. gives *gopā* for *retas* in **a**, and in **b**  
makes *dhatta* and *devās* change places; in **d** it reads *eti*.  
*Priyám* may qualify the subject in **d**: 'let it, dear \[to the  
gods\], go' etc. *Upā́kṛta* and *śaśamāná* have their usual technical  
senses, 'brought to the sacrifice' and 'efficient in the performance of  
religious duty'; the latter is explained by the comm. alternatively, as  
"being put to death" or "leaping up" (root *śaś*)! *Devās* is, according  
to him, first "the breaths, sight etc.," then "the gods, Agni etc." ⌊E.  
Sieg discusses *pā́thas*, *Gurupūjākaumudī*, p. 98.⌋

Loosing the seed of future-time existence, give good success, O Gods, to him who worships. May what is present, duly brought, the victim, go to the deities' beloved region.
