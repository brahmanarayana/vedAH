### Translation
4. The cattle that are of the village, all-formed, being of various  
forms, manifoldly of one form—let the divine Vāyu at first release them,  
Prajāpati, in unison with progeny.

### Notes
TS. and K. have *āraṇyā́s* 'of the forest' in a, for *grāmyā́s*, and TS.  
combines *vāyús tā́ṅ* in **c**, and ends again with *-vidānaḥ.* TA. (iii.  
11) has two versions (vss. 29, 32), of which the second precisely agrees  
with TS., while the first has *grāmyā́s*, like our text (and *agnís tā́ṅ*  
in **c**). Ppp. is quite different: *ya āraṇyā́ṣ paśavo viśvarúpā uta ye  
kūrūpāḥ:...mumukta devaḥ prajāpatiṣ prajābhis saṁvidānāṁ.*
