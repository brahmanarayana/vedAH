### Translation
6. He slew the dragon that had resorted (*śri*) to the mountain;  
Tvashṭar fashioned for him the whizzing (?) thunderbolt; like lowing  
kine, flowing (*syand*), at once the waters went down to the ocean.

### Notes
The text is precisely the same as in the other passages. The comm.  
explains *svaryà* as *suṣṭhu preraṇīya* (from *su* + root *ṛ*), and  
*tatakṣa* as *tikṣṇaṁ cakāra!*
