### Translation
4. Take hold of thine own dominion (*kṣatrá*), Agni; with \[thy\]  
friend, Agni, strive (*yat*) in friendly wise; \[as one\] of midmost  
station among \[his\] fellows (*sajātá*), \[as one\] to be severally  
invoked of kings, Agni, shine thou here.

### Notes
VS. TS. read *svā́yus* for *svéna* in **a**, and all the three parallel  
texts have *mitradhéye* (for *-dhā́*) in **b**, while Ppp. gives  
*mitradheyam*, and the comm. *-dhās.* In **c**, VS. TS. fill out the  
meter by adding *edhi* after *-ṣṭhā;* MS. has instead *-ṣṭhéyāya*, Ppp.  
*-ṣṭheha masyā.* Ppp. also has *vacasva* at end of **b**. The three  
other texts accent *vihavyàs* in **d**. The comm. joins *rājñām* to what  
precedes, and sagely points out that Brāhmans are  Agni's 'fellows'  
because, like him, born from the mouth of Brahman, and hence that  
*sajāta* here means Brāhmans. The metrical definition of the verse (11 +  
11: 8 + 11 = 41) is wholly artificial and bad.

Seize, Agni, on thy power and firmly hold it: contend thou with the Friend by way of friendship. Placed in the centre of our fellows, Agni, flash forth to be invoked by kings around thee.
