### Translation
3. Thee, O Agni, do these Brahmans choose; be propitious to us, O Agni,  
in the \[sacrificial\] enclosure (? *saṁváraṇa*); rival-slayer, Agni,  
conqueror of hostile plotters, be thou; watch unremitting over thine own  
household.

### Notes
MS. has the same text; the two others give a slightly different **c**:  
*sapatnahā́ no abhimātijíc ca.* Ppp. has for **b** *śivo ‘gne prabhṛṇo  
nedihi*, and for **d** *sve kṣa dīdihy aprayuchan;* it then inserts,  
before vs. 4, our vii. 82. 3; and it is very noteworthy that the three  
Yajus-texts do the same. The comm. renders *saṁvaraṇe bhava* by  
*vidyamānasyā ’pi pramādasya saṁchādane vartasva* 'hide any oversight of  
ours.' The Anukr. passes without notice the two *jagatī*-pādas in the  
verse.

These Brahmans have elected thee, O Agni: be thou propitious in our sacred chamber. Slayer of rivals, Agni, quell our foemen: watch in our house with care that never ceases.
