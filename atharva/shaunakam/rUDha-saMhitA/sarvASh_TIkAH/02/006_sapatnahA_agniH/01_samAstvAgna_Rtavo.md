### Translation
1. Let the summers (*sámā*), O Agni, the seasons, increase thee, the  
years, the seers, what things are true; shine thou with the heavenly  
bright space (*rocaná*); illuminate (*ā-bhā*) all the four directions.

### Notes
TS. reads at the end *pṛthivyā́s* (for *cátasras*). Ppp. has for **b**  
*saṁvatsara ṛṣayo yā nu sakhyā*, and in **c** gives *dyumnena* for  
*divyéna.* The comm. glosses *samās* by *saṁvatsarās.* ⌊If the  
translation implies that *rocanéna* is an instr. of accompaniment, it is  
less apposite than Mr. Whitney's earlier version, 'shine together with  
heavenly brightness'—which I take to be Agni's own (cf. RV. x. 4. 2).  
His brightness is nil by day-time. The "together" were better left out.⌋

Half-years and seasons strengthen thee, O Agni, the years, and all the Verities, and Rishis! Flash forth with thy celestial effulgence: illumine all four regions of the heavens.
