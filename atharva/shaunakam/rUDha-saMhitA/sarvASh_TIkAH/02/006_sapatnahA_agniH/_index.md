### Comment
TS. reads at the end pṛthivyā́s (for cátasras). Ppp. has for b saṁvatsara ṛṣayo yā nu sakhyā, and in c gives dyumnena for divyéna. The comm. glosses samās by saṁvatsarās. ⌊If the translation implies that rocanéna is an instr. of accompaniment, it is less apposite than Mr. Whitney's earlier version, 'shine together with heavenly brightness'—which I take to be Agni's own (cf. RV. x. 4. 2). His brightness is nil by day-time. The "together" were better left out.⌋
