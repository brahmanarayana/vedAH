### Translation
5. Over enviers, over delinquents, over the thoughtless, over  
haters,—verily all difficult things, O Agni, do thou cross; then mayest  
thou give us wealth accompanied with heroes.

### Notes
The translation implies emendation of the impossible *nihás* to *nidás;*  
the comm. shows his usual perverse ingenuity by giving two different  
etymologies of *nihas*, from *ni + han* and from *ni + hā;* neither of  
them is worse than the other. The three parallel texts all have *níhas*,  
Ppp. *nuhas*. Both editions read *sṛ́dhas*, but it is only a common error  
of the mss., putting *ṛ* for *ri;* nearly half of SPP's mss. (though  
none of ours) have the true reading *srídvas*, which is that also of VS.  
and TS. (MS. *sṛ́dhas*). In **c**, all the *pada*-mss. present the absurd  
reading *víśvāḥ;* and nearly all the mss. leave *tara* unaccented, in  
spite of *hí*, and both printed texts leave it so, although three of  
SPP's mss. have correctly *tára*, as also MS.; VS. and TS. give  
*sáhasva* for *tara tvam*, and Ppp. has *cara tvam*. For **a, b**, Ppp.  
has *ati nuho ‘ti ninṛtīr aty arātīr ati dviṣaḥ;* for **b**, VS. TS.  
*‘ty ácittim áty árātim agne*, and MS. *áty ácittim áti nírṛtim adyá.*  
The comm. explains *sridhas* by *dehaśoṣakān rogān.* In the metrical  
definition of the verse, *prastāra-* must be a bad reading for  
*āstāra-.*

Past those who slay, past enemies, past thoughtless men, past those who hate, Yea, Agni, hear us safe past all distresses: give thou us opulence with men about us.
