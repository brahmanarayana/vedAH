### Translation
5. With it will I overpower the foes, as Indra did the *sālāvṛkás:*  
smite the dispute etc. etc.

### Notes
The translation implies emendation of the inadmissible *sākṣe* to  
*sākṣye*, than which nothing is easier (considering the frequent loss of  
*y* after a lingual or palatal sibilant) or more satisfactory, for both  
sense and meter; it is favored, too, by the Ppp. reading, *sakṣīye.* No  
other example of long *ā* in a future form of this verb appears to be  
quotable; but the exchange of *a* and *ā* in its inflection and  
derivation is so common that this makes no appreciable difficulty. The  
comm. accepts *sākṣe*, rendering it by *abhi bhavāmi.* The Anukr. notes  
no metrical irregularity in the verse. In our text, accent *sālāvṛkā́n*  
(an accent-mark out of place). ⌊To Weber's note on *sālāvṛká*, add  
Oertel, JAOS. xix.² 123 f. This allusion adds to the plausibility of W's  
suggestion about the Yatis, note to ii. 5. 3.⌋

With this I overcome my foes as Indra overcame the wolves. Refute mine adversary's speech! Render them dull and flat, O Plant.
