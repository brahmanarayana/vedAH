### Translation
6. O Rudra, thou of healing (?) remedies, of dark (*nī́la*) crests,  
deed-doer! smite the dispute etc. etc.

### Notes
Ppp. has for **c, d** *pṛṣṭam durasyato jahi yo smāṅ abhidāsati*, which  
is plainly much better than the repetition of the refrain, and for which  
the latter has perhaps been substituted in our text. The comm. draws out  
to great length a series of derivations for *rudra*, and gives two for  
*jalāṣa*, and three different explanations of *karmakṛt.* ⌊Bloomfield  
discusses *jal-* etc. at length, AJP. xii. 425 ff.⌋

O Rudra, Lord of Healing Balms, dark-crested, skilful in thy work!-- Refute mine adversary's speech. Render them dull and flat, O Plant.
