### Translation
7. Do thou smite the dispute of him, O Indra, who vexes us; bless us  
with abilities (*śákti*); make me superior in the dispute.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *pṛṣṭam* for *prāśaṁ tvam* in **a**, and ends **b** with  
*-dāsate.* The comm. has *prāśam* instead of *prāśi* in **d** and is  
supported in it by two of SPP's authorities. The *prāśam* in **a** he  
explains by *vākyam*, and that in his **d** by *praṣṭāram.*

Indra, defeat the speech of him who meets us with hostility. Comfort us with thy power and might. Make me superior in debate.
