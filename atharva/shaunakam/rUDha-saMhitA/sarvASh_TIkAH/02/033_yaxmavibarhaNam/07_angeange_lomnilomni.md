### Translation
7. What \[*yákṣma* is\] in thine every limb, every hair, every joint—the  
*yákṣma* of thy skin do we, with Kaśyapa's ejector (*vībarhá*) eject  
away (*víṣvañc*).

### Notes
The first half-verse corresponds to RV. x. 163. 6. **a, b**, which (as  
also MP.) reads thus: *án̄gād-an̄gāl lómno-lomno jātám párvaṇi-parvaṇi;*  
and Ppp. agrees with it, except in having *baddham* for *jātam;* Ppp.  
also omits **d**. In **d** our P. M., with some of SPP's mss., read  
*vibar-*, as does also the comm. ⌊*vivarham*⌋. In our edition, an  
accent-mark has fallen out under *-ñcam* in **e**.

In every member, every hair, in every joint wherein it lies, We with the exorcising spell of Kasyapa drive far away Con- sumption settled in thy skin.
