### Translation
5. From thy (two) thighs, knees, heels, front feet, hips, fundament (?  
*bháṅsas*), I eject for thee the *yákṣma* of the rump.

### Notes
In the translation here is omitted *bhā́sadam*, the pure equivalent of  
*bhasadyàm*, and hence as superfluous in sense as redundant in meter.  
⌊Is not *prápada* 'toe'?⌋ The verse is nearly RV. x. 163. 4, which,  
however, omits *bhasadyàm*, and reads, after *śróṇibhyām, bhā́sadāt*,  
indicating the whole region of *anus* and *pudenda*. Ppp. ends the verse  
(like 2 and 4) with *vṛhāmasi.* Several of our mss., with two or three  
of SPP's, carelessly begin with *urú-.* MP. has in **b** *jan̄ghābhyām*  
for *pārṣṇibhyām*, and in **d** *dhvaṅsasas.* The verse seems to be  
scanned by the Anukr. as 8 + 7: 8 + 11 = 34.

Forth from thy thighs and from thy knees, heels and the fore- parts of thy feet. Forth from thy loins and hips I draw Consumption setted in thy loins.
