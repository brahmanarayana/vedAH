### Translation
4. Forth from thine entrails, guts, rectum, belly, (two) paunches,  
*plāśí*, navel, I eject for thee the *yákṣma.*

### Notes
The comm. explains *gudābhyas* by *āntrasamīpasthebhyo  
malamūtrapravahaņamārgebhyaḥ*, and *plāśés* by *bahucchidrān  
malapātrāt;* and he quotes śB. xii. 9. 1. 3, where many of the names in  
the verse occur. RV. (also MP.) has the first half-verse, as 163. 3  
**a, b**, reading *hṛ́dayāt* for *udárāt.* For **b, c**, ⌊**d**,⌋ Ppp.  
substitutes our 6 **b, c** ⌊**d**, but with *pāṇyor* in **c** and  
*vṛhāmasi* at the end⌋. The Anukr. again rejects all resolutions, which  
would make the verse a fair *anuṣṭubh*, and counts 7 + 8: 7 + 7 = 29.
