### Translation
2. From thy neck (*grīvás*), nape (*uṣṇíhās*), vertebræ (*kī́kasā*),  
backbone, (two) shoulders, (two) fore-arms, I eject for thee the  
*yákṣma* of the arms.

### Notes
This, again, is precisely RV. x. 163. 2. Ppp. reads in **b** *anūkyās*,  
and in **d** *urastas* (for *bāhubhyām*) and *vṛhāmasi.* The pl.  
*grīvā́s* for 'neck' designates, according to the comm., the 14 small  
bones found there; and he quotes śB. xii. 2. 4. 10 for authority. The  
*uṣṇíhās* he declares to be certain vessels (*nāḍī*); the *kī́kasās*, to  
be *jatruvakṣogatāsthīni*, which is quite indefinite.
