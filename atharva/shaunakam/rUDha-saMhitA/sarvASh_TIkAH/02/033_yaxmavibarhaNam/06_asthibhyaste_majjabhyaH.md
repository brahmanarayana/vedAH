### Translation
6. From thy bones, marrows, sinews, vessels, (two) hands, fingers,  
nails, I eject for thee the *yákṣma.*

### Notes
*Pāṇí* is distinctively 'palm,' and might properly be so rendered here.  
Nearly all our *saṁhitā*-mss., with most of SPP's, omit the *visarga*  
before *snā́vabhyo.* Ppp. has a different **a, c, d:** *hastebhyas te  
māṅsebhyas*...: *yakṣmam pṛṣṭibhyo majjabhyo nādyāṁ virvahāmasi.* The  
Anukr. scans as 7 + 7: 9 + 8 = 31.

Forth from thy marrows and thy bones, forth from thy tendons and thy veins I banish thy Consumption, from thy hands, thy fingers, and thy nails.
