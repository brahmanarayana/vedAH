### Translation
4. O cloudy one, gleamer (*didyút*), starry one—ye that accompany  
(*sac*) the Gandharva Viśvāvasu, to you there, O divine ones, homage do  
I pay.

### Notes
All those addressed are in the feminine gender, i.e. Apsarases. Ppp. has  
*namāitu* for *nama it* in **c**. The Anukr. ⌊if we assume that its name  
for the meter (as at i. 2. 3; iv. 16. 9) means 11 + 11 + 11⌋ passes  
without notice the deficiency of two syllables in **a**.
