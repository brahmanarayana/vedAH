### Translation
3. He hath united himself (*sam-gam*) with those irreproachable ones  
(f.); in (*ápi*) among the Apsarases was the Gandharva; in the ocean is,  
they tell me, their seat, whence at once they both come and go.

### Notes
Ppp. combines *jagmā ”bhiḥ* in **a**, and has in **b** *apsarābhis* for  
*-rāsu;* its second half-verse reads thus: *samudrā saṁ sadanam āhus  
tatas sadyā upācaryantī*. Weber takes *saṁ jagme* in **a** as 1st sing.  
The comm. gives two diverse explanations of the verse, the first taking  
the Gandharva as the sun and the Apsarases as his rays.

I came, I met these faultless, blameless beings: among the Apsarases was the Gandharva. Their home is in the sea--so men have told me,--whence they come quickly hitherward and vanish.
