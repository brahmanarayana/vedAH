### Translation
5. They that are noisy, dusky, dice-loving, mind-confusing—to those  
Apsarases, that have the Gandharvas for spouses, have I paid homage.

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **a** *tāmiṣ-*, and two of our mss. (P.M.) give the same.  
Ppp. has also *akṣikāmās* in **b**. Our W.I. combine *-bhyo akaram* in  
**d**. The verse is not *bhurij* (as the Anukr. calls it), but a regular  
*anuṣṭubh.* On account of the epithet "dice-loving" in **b**, Weber  
calls the whole hymn "Würfelsegen" ('a blessing for dice').

Haunters of darkness, shrill in voice, dice-lovers, maddeners of the mind To these have I paid homage, the Gandharva's wives, Apsarases.
