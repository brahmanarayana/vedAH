### Translation
2. Touching the sky, worshipful, sun-skinned, deprecator of the seizure  
(*háras*) of the gods—gracious shall be the Gandharva, who is lord of  
being, the only one to receive homage, very propitious.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Ppp. begins with *diva spṛṣṭo*, and inverts the order of **c** and  
**d**. The comm. explains *sū́ryatvac* by *sūryasamānavarņa*, and *haras*  
by *krodha*. The Anukr. does not heed that **c** is a *jagatī* pāda.

Sky-reaching, like the Sun in brightness, holy, he who averts from us the Gods' displeasure. Lord of the World, may the Gandharva bless us, the friendly God who only must be worshipped.
