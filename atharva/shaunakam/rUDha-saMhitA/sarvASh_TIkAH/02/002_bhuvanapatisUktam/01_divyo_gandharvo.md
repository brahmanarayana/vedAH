### Translation
1. The heavenly Gandharva, who is lord of being (*bhúvana*), the only  
one to receive homage, to be praised (*īḍ*) among the clans (*víś*)—thee  
being such I ban (*yu*) with incantation, O heavenly god; homage be to  
thee; in the heaven is thy station.

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **c** *deva divya*. The comm. understands *yāumi* in **c**  
as "join" (*saṁyojayāmi*) ⌊BR. vi. 138, 'festhalten'⌋: RV. i. 24. 11  
**a**, *tát tvā yāmi bráhmaņā*, suggests emendation. The combination  
*yás p-* in **a** is by Prāt. ii. 70.

Lord of the World, divine Gandharva, only he should be honoured in the Tribes and worshipped. Fast with my spell, celestial God, I hold thee. Homage to thee! Thy home is in the heavens.
