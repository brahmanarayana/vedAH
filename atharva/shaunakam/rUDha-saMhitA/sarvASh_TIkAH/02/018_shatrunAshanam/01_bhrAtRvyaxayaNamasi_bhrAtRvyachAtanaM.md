### Translation
1. Adversary-destroying art thou; adversary-expulsion mayest thou give  
me: hail!

### Notes
'Adversary' is lit. 'nephew' or 'brother's son' (*bhrātṛvyd*). The Ppp.  
phrases are after this model: *bhātṛvyakṣīṇam asi bhrātṛvyajambhanam asi  
svāhā*, and concern successively the *piśācas, sadānvās*, and  
*bhrātṛvyas.* The Anukr. supports the comm. in regarding the hymn as  
addressed to Agni, and agrees with Kāuś. in regard to the accompanying  
action, saying: *sapatnakṣayaṇīḥ samidha ādhāyā ’gnim prārthanīyam  
aprārthayat.* ⌊Instead of "destroying" W. has interlined "destruction."⌋
