### Translation
4. Slain is the king of the worms, also the chief (*sthapáti*) of them  
is slain; slain is the worm, having its mother slain, its brother slain,  
its sister slain.

### Notes
Ppp. has in **b** *sthapacis*, and in **c, d** (its 2 **c, d**) *-trātā*  
for *-mātā*, and *-mahatā* for *bhrātā.* TA. (iv. 36) has again a  
parallel verse: *hatáḥ krímīṇāṁ rā́jā ápy eṣāṁ sthapátir hatáḥ: átho mātā́  
’tho pitā́;* cf. also MB. ii. 7. 3 **a, b**: *hataḥ krimīṇāṁ kṣudrako  
hatā mātā hataḥ pitā.* The comm. explains *sthapati* by *saciva.*
