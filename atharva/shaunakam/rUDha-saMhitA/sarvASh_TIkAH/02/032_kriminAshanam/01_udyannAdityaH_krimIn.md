### Translation
1. Let the sun (*ādityá*), rising, smite the worms; setting, let him  
smite \[them\] with his rays—the worms that are within the cow.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The change of *ādityás* to *sū́ryas* in **a** would rectify the meter.  
But Ppp. has *adityaṣ;* its **b** reads *sūryo nimrocan raśmibhir  
hantu;* and for **c** it has *ye ‘ntaṣ krimayo gavī naḥ.*
