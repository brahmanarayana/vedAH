### Translation
2. The worm of all forms, the four-eyed, the variegated, the whitish—I  
crush (*śṛ*) the ribs of it; I hew at (*api-vraśc*) what is its head.

### Notes
The mss., as usual, vary between *pṛṣṭī́s* and *pṛṣṭhī́s* in **c**. Ppp.  
has a different version of the first half-verse: *yo dviśīrṣā caturakṣaṣ  
krimiś śārgo arjunaḥ*, with our 4 **c, d** as second half. The Anukr.  
expects us to make the unusual resolution *a-si-a* in **c**.
