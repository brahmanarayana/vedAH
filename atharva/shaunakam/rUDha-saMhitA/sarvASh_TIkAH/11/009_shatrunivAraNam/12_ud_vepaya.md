### Translation
12. Make thou \[them\] tremble; let them quake together; unite our  
enemies with fear; with broad-gripping arm-hooks pierce thou our  
enemies, O Nyarbudi.

### Notes
The comm. reads in **c** *ūrugrāhāis* (which is not bad) and  
*bāhuvan̄kāis*, explaining the latter by *bāhunā vakrabandhanāiḥ*. Our  
P.M.W. read at the end *amítrāṇy arbude:* compare 6 **a**, above.

Shake them, and let them sink with fear: e'erwhelm our enemies with dread. With widely-grasping bends of arm, O Arbudi, crush down our foes.
