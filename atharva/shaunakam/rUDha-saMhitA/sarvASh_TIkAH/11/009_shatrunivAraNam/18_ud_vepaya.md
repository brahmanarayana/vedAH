### Translation
18. Do thou, O Arbudi, make to tremble yonder lines (*síc*) of our  
enemies; let both the conquering one and the conqueror, allied with  
Indra, conquer our enemies.

### Notes
SPP. reads in his *saṁhitā*-text *jáyāṅś ca* in **c**, with the large  
majority of his mss., and with part of ours (E.O.s.m.K.). The  
prolongation being so anomalous, and unsupported by the Prāt., I thinkk  
*jáyaṅś ca* decidedly the more acceptable reading. The comm. gives it.  
He also has *śucas* for *sicas* in **b**. Read *amitrāṅ* at end of  
**c**, with *anusvāra*-sign, not *anunāsika*. ⌊Pāda **b** = 10. 20  
**b**.⌋

Make thou, O Arbudi, those wings of hostile armies quake with dread. Let Conqueror and Victor, friends of Indra, overcome our foes.
