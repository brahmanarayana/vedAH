### Translation
13. Let their arms be confounded, and what thought-and-design is in  
their heart; let not anything of them be left—in case of thy bite, O  
Arbudi.

### Notes
The second pāda is the same with vs. 1 **d**, above.

Let those mens' arms grow faint and weak, dull be the purpose of their heart; And let not aught of them be left when thou, O Arbudi, hast pierced.
