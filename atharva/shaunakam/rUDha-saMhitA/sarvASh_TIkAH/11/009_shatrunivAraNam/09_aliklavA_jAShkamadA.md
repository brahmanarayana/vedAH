### Translation
9. Let the buzzards, *jāṣkamadás*, vultures, falcons, winged ones, let  
the crows, the birds (*śakúni*), satisfy themselves—exhibiting among the  
enemies—in case of thy bite, O Arbudi.

### Notes
We have here two refrain-phrases, neither of which stands in any  
grammatical connection with its surroundings (the pple. 'exhibiting'  
being nom. sing. masc). The comm. reads in **a** *aliklabāḥ* and *yāḥ  
klamadāḥ;* and some of the mss. have *jāḥkam-* (so our B.O.s.m.).

Let vultures, ravens, kites, and crows, and every carrion-eating bird. Feast on our foes, and show where one, Arbudi! hath been pierced by thee.
