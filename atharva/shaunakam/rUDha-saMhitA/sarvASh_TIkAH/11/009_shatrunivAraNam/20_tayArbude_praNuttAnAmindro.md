### Translation
20. Of our enemies, pushed forth by it, O Arbudi, let Indra, lord of  
might (*śácīpáti*), slay each best man (*vára*); let no one soever of  
them be freed.

### Notes
'By it'—i.e. by the army; the comm. reads instead *tvayā* 'by thee.'  
With **a, b** compare vi. 67. 2 **c, d**. ⌊Our **d** occurs several  
times: see note to iii. 19. 8.⌋
