### Translation
4. The God that is Arbudi by name, and the lord (*ī́śāna*) Nyarbudi, by  
whom the atmosphere is involved (*ā-vṛ*), and this great earth—by those  
(two) who are allied with Indra, I go after what is conquered with an  
army.

### Notes
Probably 'I follow up with my army what is already conquered by them.'  
The two last pādas are by the comm. reckoned as the first line of the  
next verse.
