### Translation
11. Take ye (two) hold, tear out (*sam-bṛh*) \[their\]  
breath-and-expiration, O Nyarbudi; let groaning (? *nivāśá*) noises  
assemble—exhibiting among the enemies—in case of thy bite, O Arbudi.

### Notes
Again (as in vs. 3) the other serpent-deity is included in **a** in the  
invocation ⌊this time of Nyarbudi⌋. The comm. reads *vṛhatam* in **a**.  
He explains *nivāśās* as *nīcīnaṁ vāśyamānā ābhāṣyamāṇāḥ*.
