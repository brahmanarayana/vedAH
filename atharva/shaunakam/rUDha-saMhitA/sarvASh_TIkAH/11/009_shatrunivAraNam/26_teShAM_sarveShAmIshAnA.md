### Translation
26. Masters (*ī́śāna*) of them all, stand ye up, equip yourselves, ye  
friends, god-folks; having wholly conquered in this conflict, scatter ye  
to your several worlds.

### Notes
The mss. set the *avasāna* in this verse after *yūyám*, and SPP. very  
properly does the same. ⌊Our **b, c** = 2 **a, b**: **b** = 10. 1  
**a**.⌋  
  
⌊The quoted Anukr. says "*ye bāhavaḥ*": see vs. 1.⌋

With full dominion over these, rise, stand ye up, prepare your- selves, Ye are our friends, celestial hosts. When ye have won this battle, go, each to his several sphere, apart. HYMN X
