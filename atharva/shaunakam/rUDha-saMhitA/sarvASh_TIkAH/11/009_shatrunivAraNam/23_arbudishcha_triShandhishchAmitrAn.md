### Translation
23. Let both Arbudi and Trishandhi pierce through our enemies, in order  
that, O Indra, Vṛitra-slayer, lord of might, we may slay of them, of our  
enemies, by thousands.

### Notes
*Triṣandhi*, lit. 'of three joints,' is conspicuous especially in the  
next hymn. The comm. explains it here as *kaścit senāmohako devaḥ  
saṁdhitrayopetavajrāyudhābhimānī vā*.
