### Translation
10. We address the sky, the asterisms, the earth, the *yakṣās*, the  
mountains; the oceans, the rivers, the pools—let them free us from  
distress.

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **b** *bhāumam*. The comm. explains *yakṣāṇi* as *pūjyāni  
tatrayāni puṇyakṣetrāṇi*. MS. has the verse in ii. 7. 13, but reads  
*samudrā́n* and *veśantā́n* in **c**.

We speak to Constellations, Heaven, to Earth, to Genii, and to Hills, To Seas, to Rivers, and to Lakes: may they deliver us from woe.
