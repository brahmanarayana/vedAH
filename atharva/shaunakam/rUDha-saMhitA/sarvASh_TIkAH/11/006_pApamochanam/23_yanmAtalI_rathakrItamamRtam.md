### Translation
23. The immortal remedy, chariot-bought, which Mātalī knows—that Indra  
made enter into the waters; that remedy, O waters, give ye.

### Notes
The *pada*-text reads *mā́talī* also. ⌊Concerning Mātalī, see Weber, Sb.  
1895, p. 837.⌋ All the mss. accent *ā́po* in **d**, and it accordingly is  
read by both editions; but the sense requires the emendation to *āpo*,  
as translated; ⌊so the comm.: *he āpaḥ*⌋. The verse is so discordant  
with the rest of the hymn as to seem an addition made to it; ⌊it is not  
found in Ppp.⌋.  
  
The comm. ⌊p. 123⌋ regards the verse as referred to in Vāit. 3. 13,  
quoting the whole *sūtra*, but with *mātalyā* instead of *pātrāṇy* at  
the beginning; the mss. of Vāit. read *mātalyā* or *mārttalyā*.  
  
⌊Here ends the third *anuvāka*, with 2 hymns and 49 verses. The quoted  
Anukr. says *agnim-brūmake tisraḥ:* i.e. 'in the hymn *agnim brūmaḥ*,  
there are three \[over twenty\].'⌋

The deathless balm that Matali knows, purchased at a chariot's price, Indra effused into the floods. Waters, give us that healing balm!
