### Translation
9. Bhava-and-śarva now we address, Rudra and him that is lord of cattle;  
the arrows of them which we well know (*saṁ-vid*)—let those be ever  
propitious to us.

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **b** *ugraṣ* for *rudram*, and, instead of **d**, the  
refrain *te no muñcantv aṅhasaḥ*. The comm. has *vidmas* for *-ma* in  
**c**. ⌊Pāda **d** is nearly repeated at vs. 22 **d**.⌋
