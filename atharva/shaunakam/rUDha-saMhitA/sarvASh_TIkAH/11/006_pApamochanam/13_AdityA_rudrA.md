### Translation
13. The Ādityas, the Rudras, the Vasus, the gods in heaven, the  
Atharvans, the An̄girases full of wisdom—let them free us from distress.

### Notes
Perhaps **b** is rather 'the divine Atharvans in heaven'; Ppp. reads  
*devā dāivā atharvaṇaḥ*.

Adityas, Rudra, Vasus, Gods aloft in heaven, Atharvan's sons, The sages, sons of Angiras: may they deliver us from woe.
