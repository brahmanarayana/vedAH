### Translation
3. We address god Savitar, Dhatar and Pūshan; we address Tvashṭar at  
the head (*agriyá*): let them free us from distress.

### Notes
MS. has nearly the same verse in ii. 7. 13, but with **a** like our 2  
**a**.

We call on Savitar the God, on Pushan the establisher, Tvashtar the foremost we address: may they deliver us from woe.
