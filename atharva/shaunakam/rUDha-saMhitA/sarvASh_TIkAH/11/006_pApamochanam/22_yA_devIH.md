### Translation
22. They that are the five divine directions, that are the twelve  
divine seasons, that are the fangs of the year—let them be ever  
propitious to us.

### Notes
All the *saṁhitā*-mss. happen to read together in **b** *dvā́daśa  
rtávaḥ*, which SPP. adopts; Ppp. makes the same combination. ⌊Pāda **d**  
is nearly 9 **d** above.⌋

The five Sky regions, Goddesses, and the twelve Seasons which are Gods. The teeth of the completed year, may these deliver us from woe.
