### Translation
8. The earthly, the heavenly cattle, also the beasts (*mṛgá*) that are  
of the forest; we address the hawks (*śakúnta*), the birds (*pakṣín*):  
let them free us from distress.

### Notes
Or, 'the winged hawks.' Ppp. has a better and more independent **a**  
(ours = 5. 21 **a**, above): *ye grāmyās sapta paśavaḥ* ⌊cf. iii. 10. 6  
note⌋.
