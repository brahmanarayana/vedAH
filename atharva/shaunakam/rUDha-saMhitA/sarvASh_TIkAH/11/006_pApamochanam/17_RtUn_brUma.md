### Translation
17. The seasons we address, the lords of the seasons, the year-divisions  
and the winters, the summers, the years, the months: let them free us  
from distress.

### Notes
The verse nearly agrees with iii. 10. 9. The comm. quotes from Tāitt.  
Brah. ii. 6. 19 in explanation of what gods are lords of the several  
seasons. *Ārtavān* he defines as *tattadṛtuviśeṣasatnbandhinaḥ  
padārthān;* *hāyana* and *samā* are to him simply other names for  
'year.'
