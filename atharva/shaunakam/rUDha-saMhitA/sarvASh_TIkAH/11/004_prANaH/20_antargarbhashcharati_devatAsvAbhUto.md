### Translation
20. He moves, an embryo, within the divinities; having come into being  
(? *ā́bhūta*), having been (*bhūtá*), he is born again; he, having been,  
entered with might (*śácībhis*) what is to be, what will be, \[as\] a  
father a son.

### Notes
The understanding of this very obscure verse is not helped by the comm.,  
and Ppp. offers no variants. The comm. reads *bhūtam* instead of  
*bhavyam* in **c**. A part of the mss. read *viveśa* (not *-śā*) in  
**d**.

Filled with a babe, mid deities he wanders: grown; near at hand, he springs again to being. That Father, grown the present and the future, hath past into the son with mighty powers.
