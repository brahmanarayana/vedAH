### Translation
21. The swan (*haṅsá*), ascending, does not extract (*ut-khid*) one foot  
from the sea; verily, if he should extract that, there would not be  
today nor tomorrow; there would not be night nor day; at no time soever  
would it dawn (*vi-vas*).

### Notes
Ppp. reads *utpapadam* at end of **b**, and goes on thus: *imaṁ sa tum  
utkhide ahnāivācya naḥ śyo na rātrī nna ha syā hnaṣ prajñā tu ki cana*.  
The comm. explains the verse first as relating to the sun, for which it  
appears to be really intended, and then as applied to breath, to which  
it may be conceived to belong as being for the microcosm what the sun is  
to the macrocosm. ⌊Cf. my note to viii. 7. 24. Here one would indeed be  
reluctant to translate *haṅsa* by 'goose.'⌋

Hansa, what time he rises up, leaves in the flood one foot un- moved. If he withdrew it there would be no more tomorrow or to-day, Never would there be night, no more would daylight shine or morning flush.
