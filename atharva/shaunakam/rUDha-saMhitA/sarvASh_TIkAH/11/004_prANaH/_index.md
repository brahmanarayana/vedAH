### Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xvi. The whole hymn (together with a considerable number of others) is quoted by its opening words in Kāuś. 55. 17; 58. 3, 11, but not in a way to cast the least light upon its meaning and value. ⌊The hymn is reckoned to the āyuṣya gaṇa (note to Kāuś. 54. 11); the comm. quotes further uses from Nakṣatrakalpa 19, śāntikalpa 15, and a Pariśiṣṭa.⌋
