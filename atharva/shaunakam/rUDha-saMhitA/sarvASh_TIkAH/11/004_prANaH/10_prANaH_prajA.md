### Translation
10. Breath clothes (*anu-vas*) human beings (*prajā́*), as a father a  
dear son; breath is lord of all, both what breathes and what does not.

### Notes
Ppp. combines *prajā ’nu* in **a**, and in **d** reads twice *yas* for  
*yat*. *Prāṇáti* in **d** remains undivided in *pada*-text by Prāt. iv.  
57.
