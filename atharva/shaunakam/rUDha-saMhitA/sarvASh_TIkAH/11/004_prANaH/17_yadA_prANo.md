### Translation
17. When breath hath rained with rain on the great earth, the herbs are  
generated, likewise whatever plants \[there are\].

### Notes
Compare vs. 5 above, of which this is an imitation; Ppp. makes it yet  
closer, by reading *modante* for *jāyante* in **c**. Some of the  
*saṁhitā*-mss. read *jāyante ‘tho* (losing the accent of *átho*) in  
**c-d**.
