### Translation
26. O breath, turn not about from me; not another than I shalt thou be;  
like the embryo of the waters, in order to life (*jīvás*), I bind thee  
to me, O breath.

### Notes
The obscure second pāda is by the comm. explained to mean *mayā saha  
tādātmyāpanna eva vartase*. Some mss. (including our O.) accent *mát*  
both times, and SPP. follows them in his text: compare xii. 3. 46.  
  
⌊The quoted Anukr. says "*prāṇāya*."⌋  
  
⌊Here ends the second anuvāka, with 2 hymns and 82 verses, according to  
the count of the Berlin edition: that is 1 *paryāya-sūkta* with 3  
*paryāyas* and 56 verses and 1 *artha-sūkta* with 26 verses. But some  
mss. sum up the *anuvāka* as containing 136 "verses of both sorts," that  
is the no *avasāna-rcas* of our h. 3 (see p. 632, top, and p. 629, top)  
and the 26 *ṛcas* of our h. 4.⌋  
  
⌊The following quotation from the Old Anukr. seems to be put after the  
end of h. 4 as pertaining to the *anuvāka:* *trayas "tasyāu ’dano"  
bhavet*. Does this mean that we have no right to count the  
"*tasyāudana*" as less than 3 hymns? Cf. p. 611, ¶ 4.⌋

Thou, Prana, never shalt be hid, never shalt be estranged from me. I bind thee on myself for life, O Prana, like the Waters' germ.
