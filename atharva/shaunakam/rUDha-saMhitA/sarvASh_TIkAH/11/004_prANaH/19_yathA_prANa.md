### Translation
19. As, O breath, all these human beings (*prajā́*) are tribute-bearers  
to thee, so shall they bring tribute to him who shall hear thee, O thou  
of good report (*suśrávas*).

### Notes
Ppp. has for **d** *yas tvā śuśrāva śuśruvaḥ;* and the comm. also reads  
śuśruvaḥ. ⌊With this vs., cf. Praśna Upanishad, ii. 7.⌋
