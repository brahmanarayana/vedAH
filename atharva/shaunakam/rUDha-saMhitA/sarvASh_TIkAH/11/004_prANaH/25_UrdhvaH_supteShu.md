### Translation
25. Upright among the sleeping he wakes; by no means (*nanú*) does he  
fall down horizontal (*tiryán̄*); no one soever has heard of his sleeping  
among the sleeping.

### Notes
The comm. reads in **a** *jāgara* and understands it as impv. 2d sing.  
Ppp. has in **c** ⌊? or in **a**?⌋ *svapneṣu*. The combination of  
*suptám* and *asya* seems to make it necessary to take the former in the  
sense of *svapna*, or of *svāpa*, as the comm. glosses it. The activity  
of the breath while the other powers and senses of the body are asleep  
is a theme of wonder elsewhere also. For *supéṣú* in **a**, read  
*suptéṣu* (an accent-mark slipped over the wrong syllable).
