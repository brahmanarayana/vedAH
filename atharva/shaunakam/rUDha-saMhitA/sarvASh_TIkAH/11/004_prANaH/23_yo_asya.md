### Translation
23. He who is lord of this that has every (*víśva*) \[kind of\] birth,  
of every stirring thing—to thee being such, O breath, having a quick bow  
among the unexhausted (? *ánya*), be homage.

### Notes
The very rare ánya is rendered, at a venture, with the Pet. Lexx. ⌊see  
BR. under *ányā*, and OB. i. 66 a, end⌋; ⌊and the parallelism of the  
next vs., with its *átandra*, favors this rendering⌋. The wholly obscure  
pāda in which it occurs is explained by the comm. to mean *prāṇiśarīreṣu  
kṣipraṁ gacchate vyāpnuvate:* he takes *ánya* from the root *an*  
'breathe,' and *-dhanvan* from *dhav* 'go.' Ppp. has no variants to help  
us.

Homage, O Prana unto thee armed with swift bow among the rest, In whose dominion is this All of varied sort that stirs and works!
