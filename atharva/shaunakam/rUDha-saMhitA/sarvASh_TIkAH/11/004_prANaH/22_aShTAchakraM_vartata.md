### Translation
22. The eight-wheeled \[thing, neut.\] rolls, having one rim,  
thousand-syllabled, forth in front, down behind; with a half it has  
generated all existence; what its \[other\] half \[is\]—which sign is  
that?

### Notes
This verse also evidently belongs to the sun; with its mystic  
ascriptions are to be compared those of the partly corresponding verses  
x. 8. 7, 13. Ppp. ends instead with *kim u tasya ketuḥ;* it also  
combines *vartate ’kanemi* in **a**. The comm. reads *paścāt* at end of  
**b**, and two or three of the mss. (including our O.) do the same. 'In  
front' and 'behind' are, of course, = 'in the east' and 'in the west.'  
The **d** of *aṣṭā́cakra*, and its retention in the *pada*-text  
(*aṣṭā́॰cakram*) are by Prāt. iii. 2 and iv. 94.

It rolleth on, eight-wheeled and single-fellied, and with a thousand eyes, forward and backward. With one half it engendered all creation. What sign is there to tell us of the other?
