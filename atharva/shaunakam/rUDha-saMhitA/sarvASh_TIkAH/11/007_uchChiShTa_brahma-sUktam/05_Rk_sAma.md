### Translation
5. The verse (*ṛ́c*), the chant (*sā́man*), the formula (*yájus*) \[are\]  
in the remnant, \[also\] the song (*udgīthá*), the introductory praise  
(*prástuta*),the praise (*stutá*); the sound *hing* \[is\] in the  
remnant, the tone (*svára*), and the ring (? *meḍí*) of the chant; that  
in me.

### Notes
The comm. gives alternative explanations of *svára* and *meḍí*, showing  
that their technical meaning was doubtful to him, as to us. Ppp. has for  
**b** *udgītaṣ prastutaṁ sthitam;* in **d** it has *mīḍhus* for *meḍis*.  
⌊To the last clause the comm. supplies *bhavatu:* cf. vss. 12, 14.⌋
