### Translation
6. That relating to Indra-and-Agni, that to the purifying \[Soma\]  
(*pāvamāná*), the great-named ones (f., *mahā́nāmnīs*), the great  
ceremony (*makāvratá*)—within the remnant are \[all\] the members of the  
sacrifice, like an embryo within a mother.

### Notes
The *āindrāgna* and *pāvamāna* are explained by the comm. as two  
*sāmans;* for the *mahānāmnīs* he refers to Āit. Ār. iv. 1.
