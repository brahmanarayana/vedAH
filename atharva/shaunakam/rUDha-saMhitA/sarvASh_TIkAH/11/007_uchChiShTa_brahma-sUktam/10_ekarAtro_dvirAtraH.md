### Translation
10. The one-night \[sacrifice\], the two-night, the same-day-purchase  
(*sadyaḥkrī́*), the purchasable (? *prakrī́*), the praiseworthy  
(*ukthyà*)—\[it\] is woven, deposited, in the remnant; the minute things  
of the sacrifice, by wisdom.

### Notes
Ppp. betters the grammar of the last half-verse by reading for **d**  
*yajñasyā ’no nu vidyayā*. The comm. reads in **b** *sadyaskrīḥ;*  
*sadyaḥkrī* is especially prescribed by Prāt. ii. 62.
