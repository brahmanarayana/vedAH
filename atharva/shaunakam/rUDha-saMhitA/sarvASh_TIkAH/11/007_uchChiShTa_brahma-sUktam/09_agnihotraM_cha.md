### Translation
9. Both the fire-offering (*agnihotrá*) and faith, the  
*váshaṭ*-exclamation, the vow (*vratá*), penance, the sacrificial gift  
(*dákṣiṇā*), what is offered (*iṣṭá*) and what is bestowed (*pūrtá*)—are  
set together in the remnant.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Ppp. reads *‘ti* instead of *‘dhi* in **d**. The comm. explains *iṣṭá*  
as *śrutivihitaṁ yāgahomādi karma*, and *pūrtá* as *smṛtipurāṇābhihitaṁ  
vāpīkūpataṭākadevāyatanārāmādinirmāṇam*.
