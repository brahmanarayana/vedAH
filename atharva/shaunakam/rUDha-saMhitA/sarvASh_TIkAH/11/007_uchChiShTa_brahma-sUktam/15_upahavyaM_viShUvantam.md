### Translation
15. The added oblation (*upahávya*), the dividing \[day\], and the  
sacrifices that are put in secret, the remnant bears, bearer of all,  
father of the generator.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *divi śrutaḥ* ⌊intending *śritāḥ?*⌋ for *guhā hitāḥ* in  
**b**. The mss. are divided between *upahávyam* and *upahavyám;* the  
latter is read by our B.W.O.s.m.D.R.T.; and K. has *-havyàm*.
