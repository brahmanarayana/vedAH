### Translation
13. Pleasantness, compliance (*sáṁnati*), comfort (*kṣéma*), custom (?  
*svadhā́*), refreshment, immortality, power—in the remnant all occurring  
(*pratyáñc*) desires are satisfied with desire.

### Notes
Ppp. reads at the end *tṛmpanti*. Most of the *pada*-mss. and many of  
the *saṁhitā*-mss. read simply *kṣéma* in **a** (including our  
Bp.O.D.R.K.Kp.).
