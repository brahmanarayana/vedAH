### Comment

Found also in Pāipp. xvi.—*⌊Verses 9 and 28 are triṣṭubh, the remaining 29 being exceptions!⌋


⌊The pratīka coincides with that of xi. 6. 9, bhavāśarvā́v idám brūmaḥ, and that of iv. 28, bhávāśarvāu manvé vām: see introduction to the latter. The only quotation in Vāit. is at 29. 10, where the hymn accompanies an offering to Rudra: and it is accordingly reckoned to the rāudra gaṇa (note to Kāuś. 50. 13). Verse 31 is reckoned to the abhaya gaṇa (note to Kāuś. 16. 8). Further citations in Kāuś. are as follows: the hymn is used (129. 3) with an oblation in deprecating an evil omen; Dārīla understands it as meant at 28. 8 (see introd. to iv. 28); Keśava and the comm. hold that it is to be used with a dozen other hymns in a rite (50. 13-14) for safety on a business journey; Keśava (not the comm.) takes it to be intended with v. 6 at 51. 7 in a rite for the safety of the cattle.—According to Caland's interpretation of yuktayos at 50. 17, it is to be used (with vi. 128) in the rite there prescribed for keeping snakes etc. from house and field; but perhaps iii. 26 and 27 are rather intended (see my introduction to iii. 26).⌋
