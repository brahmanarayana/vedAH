### Translation
21. \[Be\] not \[greedy\] for our kine, our men; be not greedy for our  
goats and sheep; elsewhere, O formidable one, roll forth \[thy  
missile\]; smite the progeny of the mockers (*píyāru*).

### Notes
The insertion in **c** seems unavoidable; the comm. ⌊in a passage  
restored by SPP.?⌋ supplies *tava hetim;* Ludwig, *deinen Pfeil.* ⌊Ppp.  
inserts *‘śveṣu* before *goṣu*.⌋

Covet not thou our kine or men, covet not thou our goats or sheep. Elsewhither, strong One! turn thine aim: destroy the mockers' family.
