### Translation
26. Do not, O Rudra, unite (*sam-sṛj*) us with the *takmán*, not with  
poison, not with the fire of heaven; elsewhere than \[on\] us make that  
lightning fall.

### Notes
The comm. again correctly paraphrases *saṁ srāḥ* with *saṁ sṛja*.

O'erwhelm us not with Fever or with poison, nor, Rudra! with the fire that comes from heaven. Elsewhere, and not on us, cast down this lightning.
