### Translation
18. We go forward (*pū́rva*) to meet him of dark horses, black, swarthy,  
killing, fearful, making to fall the chariot of the hairy one (*keśín*);  
homage be to him.

### Notes
The comm. understands the connection as here given, making *keśín* the  
name of an Asura; Ludwig takes *ratham* as object of *pratī ’mas* and  
the other words as its epithets. ⌊Ppp. reads śyāvāsyaṁ at the beginning,  
and has, in **b**, *bhīmo* and *pārayantam*.⌋
