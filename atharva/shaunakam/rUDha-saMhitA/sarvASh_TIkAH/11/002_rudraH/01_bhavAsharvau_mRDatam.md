### Translation
1. O Bhava-and-śarva, be gracious; do not go against \[us\]; ye lords of  
beings, lords of cattle, homage to you! \[the arrow\] that is fitted,  
that is drawn, do not let fly; do not harm our bipeds nor quadrupeds.

### Notes
The comm. first explains *mā́* in **a** as if it were *mā*, object of  
*abhí yātam*, and then, alternatively, in its proper sense. ⌊For  
*ā́yata*, see note to vi. 65. 1.⌋

Bhava and Sarva, spare us, be not hostile. Homage to you, twin Lords of beasts and spirits! Shoot not the arrow aimed and drawn against us: forbear to harm our quadrupeds and bipeds.
