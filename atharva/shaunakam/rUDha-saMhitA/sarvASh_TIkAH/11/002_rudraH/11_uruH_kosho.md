### Translation
11. This wide vessel, holder of good things, is thine, within which are  
all these beings; do thou be gracious to us, O lord of cattle; homage to  
thee; away let the jackals, the portents (*abhibhā́*), the dogs go, away  
the weepers of evil with disheveled hair.

### Notes
The comm. identifies the vessel (*kośa*) with the *aṇḍakaṭāha*, the  
shell of the world-egg. He takes *abhibhā́s* as = *abhibhavitāras*, and  
epithet of *kroṣṭāras*, and *agharudas* as = *aman̄galaṁ yathā bhavati  
tathā rodanaṁ kurvatyaḥ;* ⌊but see viii. i. 19 and references⌋. ⌊The  
meter of **b** would be rectified by reading *víśvāni* in place of *imā́  
víśvā*.⌋

Thine is this ample wealth-containing storehouse that holds with- in it all these living creatures. Favour us, Lord of Beasts, to thee be homage! Far from us go ill-omens, dogs, and jackals, and wild-haired women with their horrid shrieking!
