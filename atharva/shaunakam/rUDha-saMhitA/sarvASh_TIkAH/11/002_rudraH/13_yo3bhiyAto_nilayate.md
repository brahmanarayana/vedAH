### Translation
13. He who, attacked (*abhi-yā*), hides himself, \[who\] tries to put  
thee down, O Rudra, him from behind thou pursuest, like the tracker (?  
*padanī́*) of one that is pierced.

### Notes
With the last pāda compare x. 1. 26 **b**; the expression is apparently  
a familiar or proverbial one: ⌊cf. Manu viii. 44, 'as the hunter follows  
the track (*padaṁ nayati*) of a deer by the drops of blood'; also  
Dhammapada, vss. 179, 180⌋. Ppp. reads *ugra* instead of *rudra* in  
**b**.

Thou, Rudra, followest close the foe who lies in wait to conquer thee. Even as a hunter who pursues the footsteps of the wounded game.
