### Translation
17. With the thousand-eyed one, seeing across in front, with Rudra,  
hurling in many places, inspired one, may we not come in collision, as  
he goes about (*ī́ya-*) with the tongue.

### Notes
The comm. paraphrases *atipaśyám* with *atiśayenā ’tikramya vā paśyati*  
(the word is omitted in both Pet. Lexx.), and connects *purastāt* either  
with it or with *asyantam;* *jihváyé ”yamānam* he explains as  
*jihvāgreṇa kṛtsnaṁ jagad vyāpnuvantam bhakṣaṇārthaṁ lihantam*, which is  
rather absurd; perhaps *jihvayā* (so Ludwig) belongs rather to 'we':  
'we, by what we say.'

Let us not outrage with our tongue far-seeing Rudra, thousand- eyed, Inspired with varied lore, who shoots his arrows forward, far away.
