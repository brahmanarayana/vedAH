### Translation
19. Do not let fly at us the club (? *matyà*), the god-missile; be not  
angry at us, O lord of cattle; homage to thee; elsewhere than \[over\]  
us shake out the heavenly bough.

### Notes
The bough, namely (so it would seem), from which the portents that fall  
from the sky appear to be shaken by a hostile divinity. The comm. reads  
*martyam* instead of *matyam* in **a**. He recognizes that *srās* (i.e.  
*srā\[kṣ\]s*) is from root *sṛj* ("= *vi sṛja* "). Ppp. has *srā m.  
devahitam* in **a**.

Cast not thy club at us, thy heavenly weapon. Lord of Beasts, be not wroth with us. Let reverence be paid to thee. Shake thy celestial branch above some others elsewhere, not o'er us.
