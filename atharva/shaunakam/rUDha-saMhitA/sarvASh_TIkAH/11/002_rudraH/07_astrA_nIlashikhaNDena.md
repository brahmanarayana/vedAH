### Translation
7. With the blue-locked archer, the thousand-eyed, vigorous, with Rudra,  
the half-smiter (?)—with him may we not come into collision (*sam-ṛ*).

### Notes
*Ardhaka-ghātin*, in **c**, is met with only here, and is of obscure  
meaning; the comm. says senāyā *ardhaṁ hantuṁ śīlam asya*, i.e. 'able to  
destroy half an army at once.' No variant is reported from Ppp. ⌊in the  
Collation: but in his Notes, Roth does report *adhvaga-*⌋; the minor Pet  
Lex. says "Ppp. *adhvaga-*" and itself conjectures *andhaka-*. ⌊Cf. the  
notes of Henry, Griffith, Bloomfield. The Kaṭha reading, however, should  
now be taken into account; and that has in fact *adhvaga-*: see  
*Kaṭha-hss.*, p. 15⁵.⌋ Ppp. has at the end *samarāmasi*.

Never may we contend with him, the mighty archer, thousand- eyed. Rudra who wears black tufts of hair, the slaughterer of Ardhaka.
