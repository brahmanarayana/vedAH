### Translation
15. Homage be to thee coming, homage be \[to thee\] going away; homage  
to thee, O Rudra, standing; to thee sitting also \[be\] homage.

### Notes
SPP's text has in **a** *te ‘stv*, with about half of his authorities.  
The verse is repeated as 4. 7, below, with *prāṇa* for *rudra* in **c**;  
Ppp. reads *prāṇa* in both places. The first half-verse is found in AśS.  
i. 12. 34 and Āp. ix. 2. 9, in both with *rudra* for *astu* in **b**.

Be homage, Rudra, unto thee approaching and departing hence! Homage to thee when standing still, to thee when seated and at rest!
