### Translation
14. Bhava-and-Rudra, allied, in concord, both go about, formidable, unto  
heroism; to them be homage, in whichever direction from here.

### Notes
Ppp., instead of repeating vs. 12 **d**, reads *tayor bhūmim antarikṣaṁ  
svar dyāus tābhyāṁ namo bhavamatyāya* ⌊cf. vs. 19 **a**?⌋ *kṛṇva*. The  
comm. explains *vīryāya* ⌊altematively⌋ by *svavīryaprakaṭanārtham*,  
which is doubtless correct.

Accordant and allies, Bhava and Rudra, with mighty strength ye go to deeds of valour. Wherever they may be, we pay them homage.
