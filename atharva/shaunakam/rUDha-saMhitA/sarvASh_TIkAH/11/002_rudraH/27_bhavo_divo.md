### Translation
27. Bhava is master (*īś*) of the heaven, Bhava of the earth; Bhava has  
filled the wide atmosphere; to him be homage, in whichever direction  
from here.

### Notes
All our mss., and nearly all SPP's, strangely read *tásyāi* at beginning  
of **c**, as if governed by the example of vs. 12 **d**. SPP. emends to  
*tásmāi* in his text, with the comm. and less than a quarter of his  
authorities; ⌊and the translation implies the change⌋. Ppp- has a  
different **c**: *tasya vā* (with *nā* written over it) *prāpad duchunā  
kā cane ’ha;* it also combines *bhavā ”papra* ⌊*urv*⌋ in **b**.
