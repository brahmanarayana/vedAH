### Translation
23. He who stands propped up in the atmosphere, killing the  
non-sacrificing, the god-mockers—to him be homage with the ten clever  
ones (*śákvarī*).

### Notes
The 'ten clever ones' are probably the fingers: cf. v. 28. 11; the comm.  
glosses the word with *an̄gulibhis*, as = *karmasu śaktābhiḥ*. Ppp.  
begins *yas tiṣṭhati viśvabhṛto antarikṣe ‘yajvanaṣ pra-*.

Homage be paid him with ten Sakvari verses who stands established in the air's mid-region, slaying non-sacrificing God-despisers!
