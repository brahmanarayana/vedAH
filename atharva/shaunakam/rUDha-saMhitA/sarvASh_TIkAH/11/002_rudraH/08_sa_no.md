### Translation
8. Let this Bhava avoid us on every side; as fire the waters, let Bhava  
avoid us; let him not plot against us; homage be to him.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *āpāi ’vā ’gniṣ pari* in **b**, and combines *no abhi* in  
**c**. The comm. has in **c** the regular form *maṅsta;* but long *ā* in  
this tense occurs a couple of times in other texts also.

May he, may Bhava from all sides avoid us, avoid us even as fire avoids the waters. Let him not threaten us. To him be homage!
