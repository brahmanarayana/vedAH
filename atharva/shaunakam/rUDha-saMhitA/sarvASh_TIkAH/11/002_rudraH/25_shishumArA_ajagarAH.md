### Translation
25. The dolphins (*śiṅśumā́ra*), boas (*ajagará*), *purīkáyas*, *jashás*,  
fishes, rajasás, at which thou hurlest: there is no distance for thee  
nor hindrance for thee, O Bhava; at once thou loolcest over the whole  
earth; from the eastern thou smitest in the northern ocean.

### Notes
Ppp. begins *siśumārā 'jagarāḥ purīṣayā jagā mat-*. The comm. has  
*pulīkayās* (like MS.); he takes *rajasā́* (p. *-sā́ḥ*) as if it were the  
instr. sing, *rájasā;* he passes *jaṣā́s* and *mátsyās* without mention,  
but defines *śiṅśumāra* as 'a kind of crocodile (*nakra*)' and *ajagara*  
as 'a kind of serpent.' For *jaṣā́s*, some of the mss. (including our  
Bp.P.M.W.) have *jakhā́s*, one or two (including our I.) have *jaghā́s*,  
and one of SPP's *jhaṣā́s;* doubtless it is the sea-monster called later  
*jhaṣa*. Nearly all the mss. have *sárvān* in **d** (only our B. ⌊and  
D.Kp.?⌋ and two of SPP's *sárvāṁ*), and SPP's text accordingly admits  
it, though it seems an evident error, and the comm. reads *-vām*. Most  
of the *pada*-mss. resolve *pariṣṭhā́sti* into *-sthā́: ásti* (instead of  
*asti*). We are surprised to find a 'northern' ocean spoken of, and set  
over against the 'eastern' one ⌊cf. xi. 5. 6⌋, but *úttara* cannot well  
mean anything else. Consistency requires the reading *-smint sam-* in  
**e**, but the *t* is accidentally omitted in our text, and SPP's also  
leaves it out.

Porpoises, serpents, strange aquatic monsters, fishes, and things unclean at which thou shootest. Nothing is far for thee, naught checks thee, Bhava! The whole earth in a moment thou surveyest. From the east sea thou smitest in the northern.
