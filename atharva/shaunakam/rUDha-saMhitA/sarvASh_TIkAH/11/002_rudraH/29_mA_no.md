### Translation
29. Not our great one, and not our small, not our carrying one, and not  
those that will carry, not our father and mother do thou harm; our own  
self (*tanū́*), O Rudra, do not injure.

### Notes
The verse occurs also as RV. i. 114. 7; VS. xvi. 15; TS. iv. 5. 10²; TA.  
x. 52, with *úkṣantam* and *ukṣitám* for *váhantam* and *vakṣyatás* in  
**b**; *vadhīs* for *hiṅsīs* and *mó ’tá mātáram* for *mātáraṁ ca* in  
**c**; and, for **d**, *mā́ naḥ priyā́s* (TS.TA. *priyā́ mā́ nas*) *tanvò  
rudra rīriṣaḥ*. The comm. has *vakṣatas* in **b**. ⌊Ppp. has, for **b**,  
*mā na kṣīyanta uta mā no akṣata*.⌋

Harm thou among us neither great nor little, not one who bears us, not our future bearers. Injure no sire among us, harm no mother. Forbear to injure our own bodies, Rudra.
