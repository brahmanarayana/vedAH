### Translation
30. To Rudra's howl-making, unhymned-swallowing (?), great-mouthed dogs  
I have paid this homage.

### Notes
The obscure *asaṁsūktagilá* (Ppp. *-girebhyas*) is paraphrased by the  
comm. with *asamīcīnam aśobhanavacanaṁ gṛṇanti bhāṣante*. How  
*asaṁsūkta* should come to mean 'unmasticated,' as given in the Pet.  
Lexx., does not appear. The translation given conjectures 'not having a  
hymn with it.' The comm. reads *elavak-* in **a**.

This lowly reverence have I paid to Rudra's dogs with mighty mouths, Hounds terrible with bark and howl, who gorge unmasticated food.
