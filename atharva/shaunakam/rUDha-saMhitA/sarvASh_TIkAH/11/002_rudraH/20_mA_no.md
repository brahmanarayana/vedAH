### Translation
20. Do not harm us; bless us; avoid us; be not angry; let us not come  
into collision with thee.

### Notes
Ppp. omits *nas* before *brūhi* in **a**, and has at the end *arāmasi*  
(as in vs. 7).

Do us no harm, but comfort us: avoid thou us, and be not wroth. Never let us contend with thee.
