### Translation
2. The Fathers, the god-folk, all the gods individually assemble after  
the Vedic student; the Gandharvas went after him, thirty-three, three  
hundred, six thousand; he fills all the gods with fervor.

### Notes
Ppp. puts the verse after 3, and reads, after *pitaras* in **a**,  
*manuṣyā devajanā gandharvā ’nusaṁyantu sarve: trayastriṅśataṁ triśataṁ  
ṣaṭsahasrān sarvān sa devāṅs tapasā bibharti*. None of the mss., nor  
either edition, reads *ṣaṭtsahasrāḥ*, as required by Prāt. ii. 8.
