### Translation
1. The Vedic student goes on setting in motion (*iṣ*) both firmaments;  
in him the gods become like-minded; he maintains earth and heaven; he  
fills his teacher with fervor (*tápas*).

### Notes
Ppp. has *yasmin* for *tasmin* in **b**; it rectifies the meter of **c**  
by reading at the end *dyām utā ’mūm;* it combines *sā ”cāryam*, and  
ends the verse with *bibharti*. The comm. explains *piparti* with  
*pālayati* both here and in vs. 2.

Stirring both worlds the Brahmachari moveth: in him the deities are all one-minded. He hath established firmly earth and heaven: he satisfies his Master with his Fervour.
