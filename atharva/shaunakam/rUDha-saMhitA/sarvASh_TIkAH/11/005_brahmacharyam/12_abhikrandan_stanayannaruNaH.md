### Translation
12. Roaring on, thundering, the ruddy white-goer has introduced (?  
*anu-bhṛ*) in the earth a great virile member; the Vedic student pours  
seed upon the surface (*sā́nu*), on the earth; by that live the four  
directions.

### Notes
Extremely obscure, and there are no valuable variants. Ppp. has at the  
beginning *abhikrandann iruṇac chatin̄go;* the comm. reads *varuṇaḥ  
śyatin̄go*, explaining the latter word by *śyetavarṇaṁ jalapūrṇam megham  
prāptaḥ*. The last pāda is found elsewhere, as ix. 10. 19 **d**, RV. i.  
164. 42 **b**.  
  
⌊For consistency, the Berlin ed. should have *abkikrándant*.⌋ ⌊The  
Anukr. defines the vs. as of 50 syllables and appears to scan it as 13 +  
11: 11 + 14 = 49. The ms. puts the mark of pāda-division before  
*pṛthivyā́m*. This last is a most palpable gloss of *sā́nāu*. If we reject  
it, pādas **b, c, d** are good *triṣṭubhs*.

Thundering, shouting, ruddy-hued, and pallid, he bears along the earth great manly vigour. Down on the ridge of earth the Brahmachari pours seed, and this gives life to heaven's four regions.
