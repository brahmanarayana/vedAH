### Translation
11. The one this side, the other hence, from earth, the two fires come  
together between these two envelops; upon them are set (*śri*) the firm  
rays; these the Vedic student stands upon by fervor.

### Notes
For our obscure first pāda Ppp. substitutes a more translatable version:  
*arvāg anyo divas pṛṣṭhād ito ‘nyaṣ pṛthivyāḥ;* and it reads *ati* for  
*‘dhi* in **c**; and the comm. has also *ati*, combining it with the  
following to *atidṛḍhās*. ⌊The comm. also has *tām* (misprinted *tā:*  
see "Corrections") for *tān* in **d**.⌋

Hitherward one, hence from the earth the other, two Agnis meet between these cloudy regions. Close to these two firm rays of light are clinging. The Brahma- chari enters them through Fervour.
