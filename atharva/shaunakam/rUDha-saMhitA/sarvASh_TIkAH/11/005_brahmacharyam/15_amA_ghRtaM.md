### Translation
15. Varuṇa, having become teacher, makes his own (? *amā́*) the entire  
ghee; whatever he sought of Prajāpati, that the Vedic student furnished,  
a friend (*mitrá*) from his own self.

### Notes
The translation implies *svā́t* as the proper *pada*-reading in **d**,  
and the comm. also understands this; but all the *pada*-mss. read  
*svā́n*, as if accus. pl. The end of this verse and the beginning of the  
next are unfortunately wanting in Ppp.; it reads at the beginning *amād  
idaṁ kṛṇ-*. The mss. put the *avasāna* after *prajā́palāu* instead of  
after *váruṇaḥ*, and SPP. divides accordingly ⌊see his note⌋; our  
division is changed in obedience to the requirements of the sense.  
Ludwig understands *mitrás* as signifying the god Mitra.

Varuna, made a Master, takes at home the butter to himself. Whatever with Prajapati he sought, the Brahmachari gave like Mitra from his loftiest soul.
