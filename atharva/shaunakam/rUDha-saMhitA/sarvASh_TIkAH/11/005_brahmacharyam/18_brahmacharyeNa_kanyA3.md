### Translation
18. By Vedic-studentship a girl wins (*vid*) a young husband; by  
Vedic-studentship a draft-ox, a horse strives to gain (*ji*) food.

### Notes
Instead of *jigīṣati* at the end, SPP. reads *jigīrṣati* 'strives to  
swallow,' finding it in the comm., and in less than a quarter (four out  
of seventeen) of his authorities; none of ours give it, so far as noted.  
Ppp. suggests yet another and a better reading, namely *jihīrṣati*—if,  
as seems probable, that underlies its corruption *jāhiruṣati*. As  
between *jigīṣati* and *jigīrṣati*, the former seems preferable. ⌊These  
verses will seem much less inept if we give a less rigid interpretation  
to *brahmacarya:* see Deussen, p. 281, p. 278.⌋

By self-restraint a maiden finds a youth to be her wedded lord. By self-restraint the ox and horse seek to win fodder for them- selves.
