### Translation
24. The Vedic student bears a shining *bráhman;* in that \[are\] woven  
together all the gods; \[he\] generating breath-and-expiration, then  
out-breathing (*vyāná*), speech, mind, heart, *bráhman*, wisdom.

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **b** *asmin* for *tasmin;* its verse has for second half  
our 26 **c, d**, and our 24 **c, d** is added at the end of our 23,  
which, as above noticed, comes second of the two verses; it reads for  
**d** *cakṣuś śrotraṁ janayan brahma medhām*. ⌊The sequence is,  
therefore, 24 **a, b**, 26 **c, d**, 23, 24 **c, d**.⌋ The GB. cites  
*prāṇāpānāu janayan* as a *pratīka* at i. 2. 8.
