### Translation
23. That, sent forth (? *pariṣūtá*) of the gods, not mounted onto, goes  
about shining; from that \[was\] born the *brā́hmana*, the chief  
*bráhman*, and all the gods, together with immortality.

### Notes
The translation of the first half-verse is merely mechanical. The second  
is identical with 5 **c, d**, above. Ppp. puts the verse after our vs.  
24, reads *puruhūtam* instead of the obscure *pariṣūtam* in **a**, and  
gives the verse a last half of its own: *tasmin sarve paśavas tatra  
yajñās tasminn annaṁ saha devatābhiḥ;* and this version of the second  
half-verse is given in GB. i. 2. 7. The comm. explains *pariṣūtam* as  
*parigṛhītam; ātmatayā sākṣātkṛtam*.

Piled up on high, but never yet ascended, that power of deities is brightly shining. From that sprang heavenly lore, the loftiest Brahma, and all the Gods with, life that lasts for ever.
