### Translation
3. The teacher, taking \[him\] in charge (*upa-nī*), makes the Vedic  
student an embryo within; he bears him in his belly three nights; the  
gods gather unto him to see him when born.

### Notes
*Upa-nī* probably already a technical term for 'receive as pupil,  
initiate.' ⌊Prescribed in the schol. to Kāuś. 55. 18, as noted above.⌋  
⌊The first line seems to be prose: see at end of Anukr.-extracts.⌋
