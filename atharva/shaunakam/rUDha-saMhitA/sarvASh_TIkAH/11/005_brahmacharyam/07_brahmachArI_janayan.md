### Translation
7. The Vedic student, generating the *bráhman*, the waters, the world,  
Prajāpati, the most exalted one, the virāj, having become an embryo in  
the womb of immortality; having become Indra, he has shattered (*tṛh*)  
the Asuras.

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **d** *amṛtān* instead of *asurān*. More than half of  
SPP's authorities read *bhūtvā amṛt-* uncombined in **c**.
