### Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xvi. (with slight differences of order, which will be pointed out under the verses). Not quoted either in the Kāuśika or in the Vāitāna Sūtra; ⌊but the schol. to Kāuś. 55. 18 prescribe vs. 3 for use in the upanayana⌋. ⌊It is cited also at the beginning of GB. (i. 2. 1-8), the chapter on the brahmacārin.⌋


### Translations
Translated: Muir, v. 400 (18 vss.); Ludwig, p. 452; Scherman, p. 84 (19 vss.); Deussen, Geschichte, i. 1. 277; Henry, 114, 150; Griffith, ii. 68; Bloomfield, 214, 626.—Cf. also Bergaigne-Henry, Manuel, p. 161; Hillebrandt, Ved. Mythol., i. 471. Henry, p. ix of his preface to Books X-XII, cites this hymn in his discussion of bráhman, which he connects with root bhrāj; and Oldenberg reviews the matter in IFA. viii. 40-41. Deussen entitles the hymn "The Brahman-pupil as incarnation of Brahm," and gives a general interpretation of its content by way of introduction. This should be consulted. The rendering "Vedic-studentship" is too rigid to fit everywhere: cf. vs. 18, note.
