### Translation
10. The one this side, the other beyond, the back of the sky, in secret  
\[are\] deposited ⌊*ni-dhā*⌋ the two treasures (*nidhí*) of the  
*brā́hmaṇa;* them the Vedic student defends by fervor; the whole of that  
he, knowing, makes *bráhman* for himself.

### Notes
The construction and sense of the last pāda are very doubtful. For  
**c**, Ppp. has its version of our 8 **c** over again: *tāu brahmacārī  
tapasā ’bhi rakṣati;* it also combines *parā ’nyo* in **a**. ⌊To bring  
out the play of the original, one might render *nidhī́* by 'deposits.'⌋

Both treasuries of sacred lore lie hidden, one hitherward, beyond heaven's ridge the other. The Brahmachari with his Fervour guards them. He makes this all his own as knowing Brahma.
