### Translation
5. Prior born of the *bráhman*, the Vedic student, clothing himself with  
heat (*gharmá*), stood up with fervor; from him \[was\] born the  
*brā́hmaṇa*, the chief *bráhman*, and all the gods, together with  
immortality (*amṛ́ta*).

### Notes
Ppp. reads *tapaso ‘dhi tiṣṭhat* at end of **b**. Of a the meaning may  
probably be 'was born before the *bráhman*' (so the translators).
