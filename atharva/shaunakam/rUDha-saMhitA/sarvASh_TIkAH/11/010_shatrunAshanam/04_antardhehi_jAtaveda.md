### Translation
4. O Jatavedas, Aditya, put thou between much human flesh; let this army  
of Trishandhi be well-placed in my control.

### Notes
Most of SPP's *pada*-mss. give *sénāḥ* in **c**; no such reading has  
been noted among our mss. One would like to improve meter and sense  
together by emending *tríṣandhes* to *-dhinā*, understanding the 'army'  
to be the enemy's. *Antár dhehi* at the beginning may also mean 'hide';  
and the comm. juggles the line into signifying, 'O Jātavedas, make the  
corpses of our enemies hide the sun'!

Omniscient Aditya, make full many a corpse to disappear. Let this devoted army of Trishandhi be in my control.
