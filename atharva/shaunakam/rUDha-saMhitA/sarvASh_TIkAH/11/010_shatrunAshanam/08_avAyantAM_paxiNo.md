### Translation
8. Let the winged ones descend, the birds, they that go about in the  
atmosphere, in the sky; let the wild beasts, the flies, take hold  
together; let the raw-flesh-eating vultures scratch at the human  
carrion.

### Notes

Let all the birds that move on wings come downward, all fowls that roam the heavens and air's midregion. Let beasts of prey and flies attacks, and vultures that eat raw flesh mangle and gnaw the carcase.
