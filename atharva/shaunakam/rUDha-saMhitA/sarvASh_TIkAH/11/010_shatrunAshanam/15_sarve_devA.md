### Translation
15. Let all the gods come over hither; the offering \[is\] dear to  
Trishandhi; defend ye the great agreement by which in the beginning the  
Asuras were conquered.

### Notes
The comm. appears to read in **a** *-yanti*, as in vs. 14 **a**, but he  
interprets it as an imperative this time.
