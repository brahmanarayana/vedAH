### Translation
24. Who have chariots, who have no chariots, those without seats and  
they who have seats (*sādá*)—all those, being slain, let vultures,  
falcons, birds (*patatrín*) eat.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
We may fairly question whether 'seat' means here 'seat on horseback.'  
The comm. explains *asādās* by *aśvādiyānarahitāḥ padātayaḥ*, and  
*sādinas* by *aśvārūḍhāḥ* 'mounted on horses.'
