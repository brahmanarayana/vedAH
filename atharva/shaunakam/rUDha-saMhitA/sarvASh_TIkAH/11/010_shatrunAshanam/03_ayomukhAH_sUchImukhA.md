### Translation
3. Iron-(*áyas-*)mouthed, needle-mouthed, likewise  
thorn-tree-(*vikan̄kaṭī-*)mouthed, let the flesh-eaters, of  
wind-swiftness, fasten on our enemies with the three-jointed  
(*tríṣandhi*) thunderbolt.

### Notes
The comm. regards the epithets as signifying flesh-eating birds, and  
supplies ⌊alternatively⌋ 'sent forth' (*preritās*) to the concluding  
instrumentals.

Let those with iron faces, with faces like needles or like combs, Flesh-eaters, rapid as the wind, cling closely to our foemen with Trishandhi for their thunderbolt.
