### Translation
19. O Trishandhi, do thou envelop our enemies with darkness; of them  
yonder, thrust forth by the speckled butter, let none soever be freed.

### Notes
The last half-verse is nearly identical with viii. 8. 19 **c, d**. ⌊For  
the stock-phrase **d**, see iii. 19. 8, note.⌋

Do thou, Trishandhi, with the gloom of darkness compass round our foes; Let none escape of them expelled with speckled butter mixt with curds.
