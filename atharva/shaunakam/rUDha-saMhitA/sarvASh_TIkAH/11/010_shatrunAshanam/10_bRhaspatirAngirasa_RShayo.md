### Translation
10. Brihaspati of the An̄giras race, the seers sharpened by the  
*bráhman*, set up (*ā-śri*) in the sky the Asura-destroying weapon,  
Trishandhi.

### Notes
One would like to emend *ān̄girasás* to *án̄girasas* (as Ludwig  
translates). The comm. renders *ā́ ’śrayan* by *asevanta*, as if it were  
*ā́ ’śrayanta*.
