### Translation
27. \[The offering\] which the gods follow (*anu-sthā*), of which there  
is no failure—with that let Indra, Vṛitra-slayer, slay, with the  
three-jointed thunderbolt.

### Notes
⌊Here ends the fifth *anuvāka*, with 2 hymns and 53 verses. The quoted  
Anukr. says, referring to this last hymn, *antyo viṅśatiḥ sapta cā  
’parāḥ.*⌋  
  
⌊The sum of the verses for hymns 1-2 and 4-10 is (68 + 189 =) 257.  
Reckoning hymn 3 (with the Berlin ed.) as of 56 vss., we get for the  
book (257 + 56 =) 313: and this is the summation given by codex I. On  
the other hand, reckoning hymn 3 as of (31 + 72 + 7 =) 110 vss. (see pp.  
632, 628), we get for the book (257 + 110 =) 367. But the summation  
given by four of W's mss. (including P.W.B.) is 365. How to account for  
the discrepancy I do not see. One ms. sums up the last *anuvāka* as 51  
(i.e. 26 + 25?—instead of 26 + 27 = 53) verses, and 10. 17 is indeed a  
*galita*-verse; but the Old Anukr. reckons hymn 10 as 27, not 25.⌋  
  
⌊Three or four mss. sum up the *sūktas* "of both kinds" as 12.⌋  
  
⌊Here ends the twenty-fifth *prapāṭhaka*.⌋

With this which Gods attend, with this which never fails to gain its end, Let Indra, Vritra-slayer, smite, and with Trishandhi as a bolt.
