### Translation
13. Righteousness (*ṛtá*) \[its\] hand-washing, the brook (*kulyā̀*)  
\[its\] pouring-on.

### Notes
In order to force a parallelism into it, the comm. explains *ṛta* as a  
'name for water,' and as signifying 'all the water that is found in the  
world.' The Pet. Lex., on the other hand, conjectures 'family custom'  
for *kulyā̀;* it is translated above as if = *kulyā́*, as the comm. takes  
it.
