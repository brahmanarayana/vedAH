### Translation
27. Hast thou eaten the rice-dish, or the rice-dish thee?

### Notes
The mss. again disagree as to the accent of *prāśī3s*, the majority  
(including our Bp.P.M.) having *prā́śī3s* as *odaná* happens to have its  
natural accent on the final, there is no discordance as to *odanā́3ḥ*.

Thou hast eaten the Odana and the Odana will eat thee.
