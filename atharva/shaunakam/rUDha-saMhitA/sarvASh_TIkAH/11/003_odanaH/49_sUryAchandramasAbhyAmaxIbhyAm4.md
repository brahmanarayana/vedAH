### Translation
49. If thou hast eaten it with another firm standing (*pratiṣṭhā́*) than  
that with which the ancient seers ate this, without firm standing,  
without support (*āyátana*) wilt thou die: thus one says to him; it  
verily \[have\] I not \[eaten\] coming hither, nor retiring, nor coming  
on; standing firm in truth, therewith have I etc. etc.

### Notes
All our *saṁhitā*-mss., and the majority of SPP's, have the false accent  
*apratiṣṭhānó ‘nāy-* in **b**; both editions emend to *-ṣṭhānò*. Some of  
our mss. (B.P.M.) read *pratiṣṭhā́yā* in **d**, as if aiming at  
*pratiṣṭháyā*.

bhurik sāmnī bṛhatī; 55. sāmny uṣṇih; 56. prājāpatyā bṛhatī.*\]

And thence, etc. . . . with other basis . . . Without standing-ground and resting-place thou wilt die . . . Having taken my stand on truth. With this I ate it, with this I came to it. Now this Odana is complete with all members, joints, and body. Complete, verily, with all his members, joints, and body is he who possesses this knowledge.
