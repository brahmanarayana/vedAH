### Translation
34. If thou hast eaten it with other eyes than those with which the  
ancient seers ate this, thou wilt become blind: thus one says to him; it  
verily \[have\] I not \[eaten\] coming hither, nor retiring, nor coming  
on; with sun-and-moon as eyes, with them have I eaten it, with them etc.  
etc.

### Notes
All the mss. read *sūryācandramasā́bhyām*, which SPP. has very properly  
retained in his text; ours was altered to agree with vi. 128. 3, but the  
alteration should have been the other way.

And thence he said to him. Thou hast eaten this with other eyes . . . thou wilt be blind. With Sun and Moon, etc.
