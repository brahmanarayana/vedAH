### Translation
32. If ⌊*ca*⌋ thou hast eaten it with another head than that (*tátas*)  
with which the ancient seers ate this, thy progeny, from the oldest  
down, will die: so one says to him; it verily I \[have\] not \[eaten\]  
coming hither (*arvā́ñc*), nor retiring, nor coming on; with Brihaspati  
\[as\] head, therewith have I eaten it, therewith have I made it go;  
this rice-dish, verily, is whole-limbed, whole-jointed, whole-bodied;  
whole-limbed, whole-jointed, whole-bodied becometh he who knoweth thus.

### Notes
The *pada*-reading of *prā́śīs* in **a** is *pra॰ā́śīḥ*.

And thence he said to this one, Thou hast eaten this with a different head from that with which the ancient Rishis ate: thy offspring, reckoning from the eldest, will die. I have eaten it neither turned downward, nor turned away, nor turned hitherward. With Brihaspati as head: with him I have eaten, with him have I come to it. Now this Odana is complete with all members, joints, and body. Complete, verily, with all his members, joints, and body is he who possess this knowledge.
