### Translation
54. He who becomes the on-looker (*upadraṣṭṛ́*) of one knowing thus  
stops \[his own\] breath.

### Notes
*Upadraṣṭṛ́* ought to have here some special and offensive sense; but  
what? All the mss. leave *bhavati* unaccented, and SPP's text follows  
them; ours makes the necessary emendation to *bhávati*. We might expect  
*runddhe*, middle, but the following verses show whose breath is meant.
