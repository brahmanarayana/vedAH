### Translation
33. If thou hast eaten it with other ears than those ⌊*tátas*⌋ with  
which the ancient seers ate this, thou wilt become deaf: thus one says  
to him; it verily \[have\] I not \[eaten\] coming hither, nor retiring,  
nor coming on; with heaven-and-earth as ears, with them have I eaten it,  
with them have I made it go etc. etc.

And thence he said to him, Thou hast eaten this with other ears than those with which the ancient Rishis ate it. Thou wilt be deaf. I have eaten it neither, etc. (as in verse 32). With Heaven and Earth as ears, with these I have eaten it, with these I have come to it. Now this Odana, etc. (as in 32).
