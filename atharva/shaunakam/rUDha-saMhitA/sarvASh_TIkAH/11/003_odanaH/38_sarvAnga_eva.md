### Translation
38. If thou hast eaten it with other breaths-and-expirations than those  
with which the ancient seers ate this, breaths-and-expirations will quit  
thee: thus one says to him; it verily \[have\] I not \[eaten\] coming  
hither, nor retiring, nor coming on; with the seven seers as  
breaths-and-expirations, therewith have I etc. etc.

### Notes
The mss., as usual, are divided between *saptarṣibhis* and *saptaṛṣi-*  
in this verse; SPP. adopts the former.
