### Translation
45. If thou hast eaten it with other knees (*aṣṭhīvánt*) than those  
with which the ancient seers ate this, thou wilt become lame: thus one  
says to him; it verily \[have\] I not \[eaten\] coming hither, nor  
retiring, nor coming on; with Tvashṭar's knees, therewith have I etc.  
etc.
