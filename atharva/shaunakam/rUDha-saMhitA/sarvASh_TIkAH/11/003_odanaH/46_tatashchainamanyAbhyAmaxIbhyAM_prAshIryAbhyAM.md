### Translation
46. If thou hast eaten it with other feet than those with which the  
ancient seers ate this, thou wilt be much-wandering: thus one says to  
him; it verily \[have\] I not \[eaten\] coming hither, nor retiring,  
nor coming on; with the feet of the two Aśvins, therewith have I etc.  
etc.
