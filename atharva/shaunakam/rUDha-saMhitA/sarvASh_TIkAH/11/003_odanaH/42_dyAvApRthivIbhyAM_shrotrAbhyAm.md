### Translation
42. If thou hast eaten it with another belly than that with which the  
ancient seers ate this, the colic (? *udaradārá*) will slay thee: thus  
one says to him; it verily \[have\] I not \[eaten\] coming hither, nor  
retiring, nor coming on; with truth as belly, therewith have I etc. etc.

### Notes
The comm. explains *udaradāra* as *udarasya daraṇātmako ’tīsārākhyo  
rogaḥ*, or diarrhœa.
