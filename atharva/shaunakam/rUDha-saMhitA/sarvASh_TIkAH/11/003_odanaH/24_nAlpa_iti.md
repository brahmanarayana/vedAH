### Translation
24. May not say "\[it is\] little," not "\[it is\] without onpouring,"  
nor "\[it is\] this thing soever."

### Notes
*Upasecana* is explained by the comm. as 'milk, butter, curd, or the  
like, that is poured on'—we might render by 'sauce.'

Would say, Not small, nor devoid of moistening sauce; not this, nor any- thing whatever.
