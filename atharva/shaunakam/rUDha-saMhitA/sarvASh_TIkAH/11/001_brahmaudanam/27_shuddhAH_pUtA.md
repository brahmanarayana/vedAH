### Translation
27. These cleansed purified worshipful maidens I seat in separate  
succession in the hands of the priests (*brahmán*); with what desire I  
now pour you on, may Indra here with the Maruts grant me that.

### Notes
⌊Pāda **a** = vs. 17 **a**.⌋ Nearly identical with vi. 122. 5, and  
slightly different from x. 9. 27. The verse is quoted by Kāuś. 63. 4;  
⌊so the comm.: under vi. 122. 5 he made the sūtra apply to that verse⌋.  
Ppp. has a wholly different **a**: *iyam āpo madhnmatī ghṛtaścyuto;* ⌊it  
reads *brāhmaṇā* at beginning of **b**⌋; and combines *yatkāme ‘dam* in  
**c**.
