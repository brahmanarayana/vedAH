### Translation
23. Fashioned by righteousness (*ṛtá*), set by mind, this was ordained  
in the beginning the sacrificial hearth of the *brahmán*-rice-dish;  
apply, O woman, the cleansed shoulder-bearer (?); on that set the  
rice-dish of them of the gods.

### Notes
SPP. reads in **c** *aṅsadrī́m*, with rather the larger number of  
authorities (of our mss. Bp.P.M.W.I.K.Kp.), though only *-dhrīm* seems  
to offer any etymology, and that an unsatisfactory one. The comm. has  
*aṅśadhrīm* 'portion-holder,' which is perhaps the true reading. The  
*pada*-text leaves the word undivided. The mss. of Kāuś. (61. 44), it  
may be noted, also vary between *aṅsadhrīm* and *-drīm* in quoting the  
*pratīka* of the second half-verse. *Dāivyānām* would rectify the meter  
of **d**, but no ms. reads it, though two of SPP's, and the comm., give  
*devānām*. Ppp. reads in **a** *manaso kite ’yaṁ*, in **b** *nihaṅtā*  
for *vihitā*, in **c** *aśadhriyaṁ*, emended by another hand to  
*-ddhiyaṁ*.
