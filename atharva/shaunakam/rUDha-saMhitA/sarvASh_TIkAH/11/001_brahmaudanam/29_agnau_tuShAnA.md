### Translation
29. Strew thou the husks in the fire, in Jātavedas; wipe off far away  
the chaff (? *kambū́kān*); this we have heard to be the share of the  
house-king; also we know the portion (*bhāgadhéya*) of Perdition  
(*nírṛti*).

### Notes
Ppp. reads *upa mṛḍhvayetām* for *apa mṛḍḍhi dūram* in **b**. The comm.  
explains *kambūkān* as = *phalīkaraṇān*, and follows Kāuś. (63. 7) in  
regarding the 'wiping away' as done with the foot.

Lay thou the chaff in Agni Jatavedas: remove the husks and drive them to a distance. That, we have heard, that is the House-Lord's portion: we know the share allotted to Destruction.
