### Translation
25. Let them of the gods sit by thee, a cooked (*śṛtá*) oblation; having  
crept out of the fire, sit thou forward again to them; purified by soma,  
sit thou in the belly of the worshipers (*brahmán*); let not them of the  
seers, partakers (*prāśitṛ́*) of thee, suffer harm.

### Notes
Ppp. begins *śrutaṁ tvā havir*, has for **b** *anusṛpyā ’gne punar enaṁ  
pra sṛpyas* (without any *avasāna*), reads in **c-d** *brāhmaṇā  
ārṣeyās*, and reads and combines *ma rṣaṁ* in **d**. The comm. ⌊with two  
of SPP's authorities⌋ reads *devās* at end of **a**, and treats *te* in  
**d** as *té*. Accompanies, according to Kāuś. 63. 3, the seating of  
'four *ārṣeyas*, who know the *bhṛgvan̄giras*' by the offering.

Let the dressed offering and divine Ones serve thee: creep from. the fire again, own these as masters. Made pure with Soma rest within the Brahmans: let not thine eaters, Rishis' sons, be injured.
