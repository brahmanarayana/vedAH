### Translation
16. O Agni, the worshipful pot hath ascended thee; bright (*śúci*), very  
hot, do thou heat it with heat; let those of the seers, those of the  
gods, gathering unto their share, very hot, heat this with the seasons.

### Notes
The comm. understands the epithets in **b** as belonging to *carús*,  
which is doubtless wrong; those in **c** he understands of 'Brahmans'  
and 'attendants on Indra and the other gods'; without much question, the  
flames of Agni are intended. Ppp. reads in **c** *devā ’bhisaṁhatya*.  
The verse plainly accompanies the setting of the vessel for boiling on  
the fire: so Kāuś. 61. 31; also 2. 7.
