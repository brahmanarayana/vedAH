### Translation
28. This my light (*jyótis*), immortal gold, cooked (*pakvá*) from the  
field, this my desire-milker; this riches I deposit in the Brahmans; I  
make a road to the Fathers that is heaven-going.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The construction of the nominatives in **a, b** is left undetermined in  
the translation, as it is in the text. ⌊Cf. Griffith's version and note,  
p. 55.⌋ Ppp. has *hiraṇmayaṁ* in **a**, and *yat svargāiḥ* at the end of  
**d**. The verse is quoted by Kāuś. at 62. 22 and 68. 27; and at 63. 5  
Kāuś. cites **b** ⌊comm. **b** and **c**⌋ as accompanying a removal of  
something (*ity apakarṣati:* it is not clear what; ⌊the comm. thinks the  
rice-dish and reads *upa-* for *apa-*⌋).

Here is my gold, a light immortal: ripened grain from the field this Cow of Plenty give me! This wealth I place among the Brahmans, making a path that leads to heaven among the Fathers.
