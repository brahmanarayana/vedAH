### Translation
10. Seize in thy hand, O hero, the two joint-acting (*sakṛ́t*) stones;  
the worshipful gods have come to thy sacrifice; three boons, whichsoever  
thou choosest—those successes do I here make successful for thee.

### Notes
The comm. and one or two of SPP's authorities read *sukṛ́tāu* in **a**  
(Ppp. *sayujā*); *sakṛ́t* is not elsewhere found used as an adjective.  
Ppp. further combines *hasta ā* into *hastā* in **a-b**, and reads  
*yajñeyā* and *ayus* in **b**. The comm. renders *te* in **b** as if it  
were *té*. ⌊The definition of the Anukr. may perhaps mean 'a *jagatī* of  
elevens (*virāḍ-jagatī*), which possesses a thirteen at the beginning,  
(and which is) deficient-by-two (*virāṭ*).'⌋
