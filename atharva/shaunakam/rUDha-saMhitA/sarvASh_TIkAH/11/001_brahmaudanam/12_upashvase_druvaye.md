### Translation
12. Sit ye in the wooden blower (? *upaśvasá*); be ye winnowed,  
worshipful ones, from the husks. By fortune (*śrī́*) may we surpass all  
\[our\] equals; I make \[our\] haters to fall under foot.

### Notes
⌊The second half-verse recurs below, vs. 21.⌋ The majority of SPP's  
authorities, and some of ours (P.M.W.O.s.m.R.T.) read *dhruváye* ⌊Ppp.  
*druye*⌋ in **a**; also the comm., who explains it as = *dhruvāya  
sthirāya satyaphalāya karmaṇe;* *upaśvasé* ⌊Ppp. *upasvade*⌋ he absurdly  
takes for a verb: (*he taṇḍulā yuṣmān*) *upa samīpa āśvāsayāmi prabhūtān  
karomi!* LThe meaning '*das Blasen, Luftzug*,' is assigned to it in OB.  
iii. 257 b.⌋ ⌊Ppp. reads *pādayema* at the end of **d**.⌋ The verse  
accompanies (so Kāuś. 61. 29) the operation of winnowing. The comm.  
treats *yajñiyāsas* in **b** as nominative.

Rest in the roaring frame of wood: be parted from husk and chaff, ye Sacrificial Fibres. May we surpass in glory all our rivals. I cast beneath my feet the men who hate us.
