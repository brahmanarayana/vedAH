### Translation
7. In company with thy fellows, be thou united with milk; urge her up  
unto great heroism; ascend aloft to the summit (*viṣṭáp*) of the  
firmament (*nā́ka*), which they call by the name heavenly world.

### Notes
Addressed, according to the comm., to the sacrificer; the Kāuś. (61. 20)  
makes it accompany the pouring of rice into the mortar. The comm.  
explains *ud ubja* as *ud gamaya unnataśiraskāṁ kuru*. Ppp. reads  
*sujātāiṣ* in **a**, and *viṣṭapas* in **c**.
