### Translation
20. Thousand-backed, hundred-streamed, unexhausted, \[is\] the  
*brahmán*-rice-dish, god-traveled, heaven-going; them yonder I assign to  
thee; lessen (?) thou them with progeny; be gracious then to me \[as\]  
bringer of tribute.

### Notes
Kāuś. makes no use of this parenthetical verse of praise, prayer, and  
imprecation. The comm. and two of SPP's authorities read *reśaya* in  
**c**, and the comment to Prāt. iii. 94 (though reading *reṣayāi ’nān*)  
quotes it as an example of a palatal or lingual or dental mute  
interposed between *r* and *n*, which would seem to imply *recaya*.\*  
The comm. glosses his *reśaya* with *leśaya alpīkuru*, and, as the  
expression looks as if meant for the opposite to that in vs. 21 **a**,  
the translation has been made accordingly. ⌊Ppp. reads *akṣato* at end  
of **a**.⌋ ⌊Where the Anukr. finds a pāda of 13 syllables I know  
not.—The one of 14 must be **c**: does *para* mean simply the second  
half-verse?⌋ \*⌊That is, it implies the mute (*c*) rather than the  
sibilant (*ś*), the intervention of which was treated in the preceding  
rule, iii. 93.⌋

With thousand streams and Prishthas, undecaying, Brahmaudana is celestial, God-reaching. Those I give up to thee with all their children. Force them to tribute, but to me be gracious.
