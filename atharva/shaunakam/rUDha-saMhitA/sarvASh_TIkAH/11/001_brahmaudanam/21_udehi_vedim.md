### Translation
21. Go thou up to the sacrificial hearth; increase her with progeny;  
push \[away\] the demon; set her further forward; by fortune may we  
surpass all \[our\] equals; I make \[our\] haters to fall under foot.

### Notes
The last half-verse is the same with vs. 12 **c, d** above. The whole  
evidently accompanies the bringing of the cooked dish to the place of  
offering: according to Kāuś. 61. 41, its removal from the fire. Ppp.  
reads *enam* at end of **a**, *pratiraṁ dhehy enam* at end of **b**,  
*paśyā* for *śriyā* in **c**, and *pādayema* ⌊cf. vs. 12⌋ at end of  
**d**.

Rise to the altar: bless this dame with offspring. Promote this woman; drive away the demons. May we surpass in glory all our rivals. I cast beneath my feet the men who hate us.
