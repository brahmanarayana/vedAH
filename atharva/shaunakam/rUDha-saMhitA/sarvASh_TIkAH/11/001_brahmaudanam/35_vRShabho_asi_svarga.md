### Translation
35. Thou art a heaven-going bull; go to the seers, to them of the seers;  
sit in the world of the well-doing; there is there preparation  
(*saṁskṛtá*) for us both.

### Notes
⌊Prose.⌋ Ppp. reads *ṛṣabhas* at the beginning, and *lokaṁ* for *loke*  
in **c**. With the second half-verse is to be compared TS. i. 4. 43²,  
and MS. i. 3. 37 (end) and iv. 8. 2 (end), which read: *sukṛ́tām loké  
sīdata tán naḥ saṁskṛtám;* and VS. iv. 34 has the last pāda, reading  
*tán* for *tátra*. The *pada*-texts do not divide *saṁskṛtam;* the case  
falls under rule iv. 58 of the AV. Prāt.
