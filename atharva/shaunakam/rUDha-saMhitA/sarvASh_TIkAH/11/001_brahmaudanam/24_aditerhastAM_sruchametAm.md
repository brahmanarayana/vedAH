### Translation
24. Aditi's hand, this second ladle (*srúc*), which the seven seers,  
being-makers, made—let that spoon, knowing the members of the rice-dish,  
collect it upon the sacrificial hearth.

### Notes
The comm. reads in **a** *hastam* and *dvitīyam*, indicating that he  
regards the adjective as qualifying *hastām* rather than *srucam*—which  
may well be the case. Ppp. ⌊has *hastāṁ* and⌋ combines *saptarṣayas*.

This second hand of Aditi, this ladle which the Seven Rishis, world-creators, fashioned. May this scoop deftly pile upon the altar, therein, the members of the rice-oblation.
