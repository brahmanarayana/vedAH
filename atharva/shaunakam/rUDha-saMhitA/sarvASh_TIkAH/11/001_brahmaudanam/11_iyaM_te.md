### Translation
11. This \[is\] thy thought (? *dhītí*) and this thy place of birth; let  
Aditi, of hero-sons, seize thee; cleanse away them that would fight her;  
confirm to her wealth with all heroes.

### Notes
Said, according to Kāuś. (61. 23), in connection with taking up the  
winnowing fan (*śūrpa*). The comm. explains *dhīti* as = *pāna*, taking  
it from the root *dhā* 'suck.' One would like to derive it from *dhā*  
'put,' as 'place' or something similar. Ppp. reads at the end *ni  
yachāt*.

Here thy devotion is, here is thy birthplace. Aditi, Mother of brave sons, accept thee! Wipe away those who fight against this woman with wealth and store of goodly sons endow her.
