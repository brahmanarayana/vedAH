### Translation
6. O Agni, powerful, overcoming, thou overcomest; put down (*ni-ubj*)  
\[our\] hating rivals; let this measure (*mā́trā*), being measured, and  
measured, make \[thy\] fellows tribute-bringers to thee.

### Notes
The comm. does not try to give *ny ubja* a more distinctive meaning than  
*adhomukhān pātaya;* the obscure *mā́trā* he simply glosses by *nirmātrā*  
⌊as instrumental sing, masc. (supplying *iyaṁ śālā* as subject); but the  
three translators take it as nom.⌋.

Strong art thou, Agni, conquering, all-surpassing. Crush down our foemen, ruin those who hate us. So let this measure, measured, being measured, make all our kin thy tributary vassals.
