### Translation
26. O king Soma, strew harmony for them, for whatsoever good Brahmans  
shall sit by thee; with good call, I call loudly to the  
*brahmán*-rice-dish the seers, them of the seers, born from penance  
(*tápas*).

### Notes
In **a-b**, for *-bhyaḥ súbṛāhmaṇās*, Ppp. reads *-bhyo brāhm-*  
⌊intending perhaps *ábrāhmaṇās?* cf. vs. 32⌋; in **c** it has *ṛṣīṇām  
ṛṣayas tap-*, and *jātā* (so also the comm.) for *-tān;* ⌊and begins  
**d** with *brāhmāudane*⌋. The comm. understands *suhavā* in **d** as  
fem., and makes the sacrificer's wife the speaker. The verse is not  
quoted in Kāuś.; ⌊but Keśava cites it just before vs. 25 in 63. 3⌋.

Give understanding unto these, King Soma! all the good Brah mans who attend and serve thee. Oft, in Brahmaudana, and well I call on: Rishis, their sons, and those who sprang from Fervour.
