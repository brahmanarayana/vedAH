### Translation
14. These maidens (*yoṣít*) have come, adorning themselves; stand up,  
woman, take hold of the mighty one; well-spoused with husband,  
progeny-possessing with progeny; to thee hath come the sacrifice;  
receive thou the vessel (*kumbhá*).

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The comm. explains the 'maidens' as the 'water-bringing women,' but they  
are evidently the waters (fem.) themselves: compare vss. 17, 27 below.  
The comm. reads *tava sam*, two separate words, in **b**; ⌊Roth, in his  
Notes, adds that Ppp. reads *tavas saṁ bharasva*⌋; the 'mighty one' is  
the 'vessel' of **d**. Verses 13-15 are quoted in Kāuś. (60. 25-29), but  
not in natural sequence with the verses that precede and follow.

Hither these Dames have come in radiant beauty. Arise and seize= upon thy strength, O woman. To thee hath sacrifice come: take the pitcher, blest with a good lord, children, children's children.
