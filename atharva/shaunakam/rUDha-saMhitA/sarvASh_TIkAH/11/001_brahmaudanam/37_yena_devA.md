### Translation
37. With what light the gods went up to the sky, having cooked the  
*brahmán*-rice-dish, to the world of the well-done, with that may we go  
to the world of the well-done, ascending the heaven, unto the highest  
firmament.

### Notes
The second half-verse is identical with iv. 14. 6 **c, d**, above ⌊see  
my note⌋. The comm. reads *jeṣma* in **c**, explaining it by *jayema* ⌊=  
*prāpnuyāma*⌋. Ppp. has, instead of this repetition, a new half-verse:  
*taṁ tvā pacāmi jyotiṣāṁ jyotir uttamaṁ sa nas tad dhehi sukṛtām u  
loke.*  
  
⌊The quoted Anukr. here says *saptā ’nupūrveṇa śeṣāḥ syus triṅśateḥ  
parāḥ*.⌋

May we invested with that light go upward, ascending to the sky's most lofty summit. Wherewith the Gods, what time they had made ready Brahmaudana, mounted to the world of virtue.
