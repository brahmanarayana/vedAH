### Comment
⌊Verse 35 is prose.⌋ Found also in Pāipp. xvi. (in the verse-order 1-10, 12, 11, 13-18, 22, 19, 20, 21, 23-37). Nearly every verse of the hymn is quoted in Kāuś. 60-63 and 65 in connection with the description of the sava offerings; ⌊see Bloomfield, page 610 and the following for details so far as they are helpful⌋. ⌊Citations in other parts of Kāuś. are noted under the verses. The hymn is not noticed by Vāit.: see page 610.⌋ *⌊This curious addition to the Anukr., vyāghrādiṣv avagantavyā, recurs in the Anukr's treatment of xiv. 1. 60 and of the c of xv. 5. 1-7. See note to xv. 5. 7.⌋
