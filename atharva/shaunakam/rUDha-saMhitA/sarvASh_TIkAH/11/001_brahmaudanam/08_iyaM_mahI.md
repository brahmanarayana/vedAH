### Translation
8. Let this great one (*mahī́*) accept the hide, the divine earth, with  
favoring mind; then may we go to the world of the well-done.

### Notes
This accompanies, as is plain, the spreading-out of the ox-hide upon the  
ground (so Kāuś. 60. 30). Ppp. reads in **b** *pṛthivyāi*, and, at the  
end, *sukṛtām u lokam*. The last pāda is the same with vi. 121. 1 **d**;  
vii. 83. 4 **d**.

May this great Earth receive the skin, this Goddess Prithivi, showing us her love and favour. Then may we go unto the world of virtue.
