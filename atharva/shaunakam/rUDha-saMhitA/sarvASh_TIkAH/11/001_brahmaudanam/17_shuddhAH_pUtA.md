### Translation
17. Let these cleansed, purified, worshipful maidens, the waters,  
beauteous ones, creep down to the pot; they have given us abundant  
progeny, cattle; let the cooker of the rice-dish go to the world of the  
well-doers.

### Notes
⌊Pāda **a** is identical with vs. 27 **a** and vi. 122. 5 **a**.⌋ The  
mss. are about equally divided in **c** between *bahulā́m* and *bahulā́n*  
(our I.T.K.Kp. have the latter; O. has *-lāṁn*); SPP. accepts the  
latter, we the former; the comm. has *-lān;* and he reads *pakvā* for  
*paktā* in **d** ⌊or **c**⌋. Ppp. has *dadat* for *adus* in **c**, and  
*eti* for *etu* in **d**. The verse concerns the pouring in of the  
water: so Kāuś. 61. 34-5, and 2. 8.—⌊If we read *bahulā́ṅś ca* in **c**,  
and in **d** *pakvāúdanasya* as a compound (against the *pada*-division,  
which reckons *paktā́* to c, and against the double accent) and *u* for  
*etu*, we get most acceptable sense and meter: *lokám* would be  
construed as coördinate with *paśū́n* and *pakvāúdanasya* as coördinate  
with *nas* (cf. xi. 8. 10 **c** and Speyer, *Vedische Syntax*, §71,  
end). The heroic surgery implies no worse corruptions than we have often  
seen. But this is all mere suggestion.⌋

Purified, bright, and holy, let these Women, these lucid waters glide into the caldron. Cattle and many children may they give us. May he who cooks. the Odana go to heaven.
