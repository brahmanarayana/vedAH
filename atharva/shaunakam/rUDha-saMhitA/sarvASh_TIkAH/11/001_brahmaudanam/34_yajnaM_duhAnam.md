### Translation
34. The offering, yielding milk (*duh*), constantly full (*prápīna*), a  
male (*púmāṅs*) milch-cow, seat of wealth, immortality through  
offspring, and a long life-time—and may we sit by thee with abundance  
(pl.) of wealth.

### Notes
The construction of the third pāda is very indeterminate; the words may  
be either nominative or accusative; they express in some way what the  
offering is to procure. To illustrate *prajāmṛtatvam*, the comm. quotes,  
quite appositely, TB. i. 5. 5⁶ and RV. v. 4. 10, 'by progeny, O Agni,  
may I obtain immortality.' *Prapīnam* he explains as =  
*pravṛddhodhaskam*, which is doubtless its true meaning. Ppp. reads in  
**d** *poṣam* for *poṣāis*. Neither this nor the following verse, nor  
vs. 37, is quoted in Kāuś. ⌊Cf. Henry's version, p. 102; and, for the  
awkward *ca*, his note, p. 139.⌋
