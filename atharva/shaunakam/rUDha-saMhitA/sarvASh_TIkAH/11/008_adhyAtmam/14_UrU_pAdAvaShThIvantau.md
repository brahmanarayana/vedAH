### Translation
14. Thighs, feet, knee-joints, head, hands, also face, ribs, nipples (?  
*barjahyà*), sides: what seer put that together?

### Notes
The comm. has nothing to say for *barjahyè* except 'the parts so  
called.' Ppp. reads instead *majjahye;* and it has *śroṇī* for *śiras*  
in **b**. It also makes our 14 **c, d** and 15 **c, d** exchange places.
