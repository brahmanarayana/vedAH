### Translation
28. Both those of the blood and those of the bladder, the hasting and  
those that are pitiable, the secret, the clear, the thick waters—those  
they caused to settle in the repugnant one.

### Notes
That is, apparently, in the body that was loth to receive them. SPP.  
reads unaccountably at the beginning *ā́steyīs*, against the great  
majority of his mss., the comm., and the sense. The reading has not been  
noted at all among our mss., but *sn* and *st* are very imperfectly  
distinguished in general by the scribes, and the latter may possibly  
have been intended by some among them. The comm. derives the word from  
*ā + snā*, instead of from *asan;* the form in which he gives it is  
*āsneyyas*. The second word he reads *vāsneyyas*, and derives it from  
*vā* 'or' + *snā!* Then he adds another derivation for both words, from  
*āsana* 'sitting,' and *vasna* 'price' respectively. He reads then  
*āpas* in **c**. Ppp. reads *śukriyā* in **c**.

They laid in the abhorrent frame those waters hidden, bright, and thick, Which in the bowels spring from blood, from mourning or from hasty toil.
