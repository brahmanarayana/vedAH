### Translation
18. When Tvashṭar bored through \[him?\] who \[was\] the superior father  
of Tvashṭar, having made the mortal a house, the gods entered into man.

### Notes
Probably **c** is adjunct of *devā́s;* whether **b** is object of the  
verb in **a** is more doubtful. Ppp. gives no help. The comm. makes  
**b** define Tvaṣṭar himself, and understands the 'boring' of the  
openings for the senses, the eyes and ears etc. ⌊Ludwig renders **c**:  
"machten die götter den sterblichen zu \[ihrem\] hause."⌋
