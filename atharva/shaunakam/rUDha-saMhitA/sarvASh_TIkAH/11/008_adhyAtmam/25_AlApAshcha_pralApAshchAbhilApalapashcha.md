### Translation
25. Both appeals (*ālāpá*) and pratings (*pralāpá*), and they who utter  
(*-lap*) addresses (*abhīlāpa-*)—all entered the body, joiners-on  
(*āyúj*), joiners-forth (*prayúj*), joiners.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *prāyujas* in **d**. The comm. explains the last words as =  
*āyojanāni*, *prayojanāni*, and *yojanāni*. The first half-verse is as  
it were a change rung on 24 **a, b**.
