### Translation
29. Having made bone \[their\] fuel, then they caused eight waters to  
settle; having made seed \[their\] sacrificial butter, the gods entered  
man.

### Notes
The first part of the verse is spoiled in Ppp. The comm. has the more  
regular accus. pl. *apas* in **b** (the *pada*-text *aṣṭá: ā́paḥ*, as  
required by the accent; the comm. in general pays no heed to accent). He  
acutely refers to Tāitt. Brāh. i. 1. 9⁴, where bone is identified with  
fuel, and seed with sacrificial butter.

Fuel they turned to bone, and then they set light waters in the frame. The molten butter they made seed: then the Gods entered into man.
