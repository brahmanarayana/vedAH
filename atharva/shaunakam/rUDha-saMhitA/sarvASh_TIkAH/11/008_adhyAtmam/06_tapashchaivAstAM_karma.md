### Translation
6. Both penance, namely, and action were within the great sea; penance  
was born from action; that did they worship as chief.

### Notes
The comm. again has *āsate* at the end. SPP. reads *āstām* in  
*pada*-text, this time with two of his mss. Some mss. again (cf. vs. 2)  
read *mahati* (so our Bp.E.; P.M. *mahaty árṇavé*).

Fervour and Action were the two, in depths of the great billowy sea; Fervour sprang up from Action: this they served and worship- ped as supreme.
