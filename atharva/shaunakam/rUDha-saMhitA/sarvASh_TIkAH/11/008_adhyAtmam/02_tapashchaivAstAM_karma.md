### Translation
2. Penance and also action were within the great sea (*arṇavá*); those  
were the groomsmen, those the wooers; the *bráhman* was chief wooer.

### Notes
The *pada*-mss. (save one of SPP's) divide *evā́stām* in a into *evá:  
ā́stām*, and the accent of the verb is perfectly defensible, though SPP.  
alters to *āstām*. Some of the mss. (including our Bp.P.M.E.) leave  
*mahati* unaccented: cf. vs. 6 **b**, and iii. 6. 3.

Fervour and Action were the two, in depths of the great billowy sea? These were the wooers of the bride; Brahma the chief who courted her.
