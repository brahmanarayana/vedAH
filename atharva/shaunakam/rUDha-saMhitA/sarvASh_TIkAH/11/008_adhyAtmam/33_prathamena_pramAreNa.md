### Translation
33. By the first dying, it goes apart dividing threefold: yonder goes it  
with one \[part\]; yonder goes it with one; here with one it dwells (?  
*ni-sev*).

### Notes
This verse and the one following are (as above noted) wanting in Ppp.  
The comm. reads *ni* for *vi* in **b**. He regards the two 'yonders' as  
pointing respectively to heaven and hell, and paraphrases *ni ṣevate* by  
*nitarāṁ sukhaduḥkhātmakān bhogān sevate*. ⌊He makes *jīvātmā* the  
subject: and a masculine subject seems required by *víṣvan̄*, unless we  
read *ní* just after it.⌋

At his first death he goeth hence, asunder, in three separate parts. He goeth yonder with one part, with one he goeth yonder: here he sinketh downward with a third.
