### Translation
17. All the gods assisted (? *upa-śikṣ*); that she who was a woman knew;  
she who was wife of control (? *váśa*), mistress (*īśā́*), brought color  
into it.

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **a** *upāsikṣan*, and *viṣasya* for *vaśasya* in **c**;  
the comm. (with two or three of SPP's mss.) has instead of the latter  
*viśvasya*. There are, failing help from sense, various questionable  
points in the construction.

All Deities had lent their aid: of this a noble Dame took note, Tsa, the Consort of Command. She gave its colour to the form.
