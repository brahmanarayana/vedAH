### Translation
27. Both blessings (*āśís*) and precepts (*praśís*), demands (*saṁśís*)  
and explanations (*viśís*), thoughts, all devisings, entered the body  
afterward.

### Notes
The comm. explains the difficult compounds of *-śis* as mechanically as  
those of *-yuj* in vs. 25: *āśāsanāni*, *praśāsanāni*, *saṁśāsanāni*,  
*vividhāni śāsanāni*.
