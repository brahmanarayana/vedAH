### Translation
32. Therefore, indeed, one who knows man ⌊*púruṣa*⌋ thinks "this is  
*bráhman*"; for all deities are seated in him, as cows in a cow-stall.

### Notes
Our text should read at the end *ivā́ ”sate* with SPP. and nearly all the  
mss. (our Bp.B. *ivā ”sate*). Ppp. has a less naive **d**: *śarīre ‘dhi  
samāhitaḥ*.

Therefore whoever knoweth man regardeth him as Brahman's self: For all the Deities abide in him as cattle in their pen.
