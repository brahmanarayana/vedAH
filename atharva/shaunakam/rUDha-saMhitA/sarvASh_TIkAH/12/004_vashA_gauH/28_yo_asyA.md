### Translation
28. If any one, having overheard the verses of her, has then made her  
go about among his kine (*gó*), both the life-time and the growth of him  
do the gods, made wrathful, cut off (*vraśc*).

### Notes
Nearly all our mss. (E. has *ácī-*) ⌊and all of SPP's⌋ leave *acīcarat*  
in **b** unaccented; and then, as if by way of compensation, they mostly  
(except Bs.s.m.D.R.) accent *vṛ́ścanti*.
