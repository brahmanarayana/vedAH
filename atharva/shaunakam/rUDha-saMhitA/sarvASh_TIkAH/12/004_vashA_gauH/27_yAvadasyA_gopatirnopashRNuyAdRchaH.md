### Translation
27. So long as the master of her should not himself overhear the verses  
(*ṛ́ś*), so long may she go about among his kine (*gó*); she may not  
abide in his house after he has heard.

### Notes
The translation implies the evidently necessary emendation of *vaśet* at  
the end to *vaset;* R., indeed, has the latter; ⌊and so have 8 of SPP's  
authorities, against 7 with vaśet;⌋ Ppp. is corrupt: *nā ’sya śrutā gṛhe  
sya*. The Anukr. takes no notice of any redundancy in **b**; but it can  
hardly expect us to make a *pada*-division between *no* and  
*’paśṛṇuyāt*. The 'verses' are doubtless those with which the Brahmans  
come to claim their rightful property.

Long as her owner hath not heard, himself, the verses, let her move Among his kine: when he hath heard, let her not make her home with him;
