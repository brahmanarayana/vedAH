### Translation
35. With the sacrificial cake as calf, milking well, she draws near to  
him in the world; she yields (*duh*) to him all his desires—\[namely,\]  
the cow ⌊*vaśā́*⌋ to him who has presented her.

### Notes
Ppp. reads, in **b**, *loke ‘syo ’pa;* and, for **c**, *sahasmāi sarvān  
kāmān mahe*. The Anukr. takes no notice of the irregular meter in pādas  
**a** and **c**. All the *saṁhitā*-mss. accent *loké ‘smā* in **b**; our  
text emends to *lokè*.
