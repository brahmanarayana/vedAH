### Translation
3. By a hornless one they are crushed for him; by a lame one he falls (?  
*ard*) into a pit; by a crippled one his houses are burned; by a  
one-eyed one his possessions are taken away (?).

### Notes
The adjectives are feminine, and the sense doubtless is that as the  
result of giving such defective cows the thing threatened will happen.  
In **a**, probably the subject to be understood is *gṛhā́s*, as in **c**;  
**b** and **c** have perhaps become transposed—and, in that case, *svám*  
might be the subject also of *árdati*. ⌊Ppp. has *kāṭam*, like the  
Vulgate.⌋ The translation of **d** implies emendation (which seems  
advisable ⌊cf. W. in AJP. xiii. 302⌋) of *kāṇáyā* to *kāṇáyā́:* i.e.  
*kāṇáyā: ā́: dīyate*. Ppp. has *jīyate* 'is harmed,' which would remove  
the difficulty. ⌊On *kūṭá*, see von Bradke, KZ. xxxiv. 157.⌋

They perish through a hornless cow, a lame cow sinks them in a pit. Through a maimed cow his house is burnt: a one-eyed cow destroys his wealth.
