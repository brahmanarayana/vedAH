### Translation
22. If a hundred other Brahmans should ask the cow of its master, yet  
(*átha*) the gods said of her: the cow is his who knoweth thus.

### Notes
All our mss. save two (I. and \[?\] E.s.m.) read *etām* (without accent)  
in **c**; our text follows the two.

If hundred other Brahmans beg the Cow of him who owneth her, The Gods have said, She, verily, belongs to him who knows the truth.
