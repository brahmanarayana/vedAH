### Translation
11. They who come to the winning (*vaní*) of her, theirs is the god-made  
cow ⌊*vaśā́*⌋; they called it *bráhman*-scathing, if anyone keeps her to  
himself.

### Notes
Pāda **b** seems to mean virtually 'she is by the gods made theirs.'  
Ppp. reads at the end (as also in vss. 21, 25) *nu priyāyate*, and  
*nipr-* is certainly very questionable, since no *nipriya* nor even root  
*prī + ni* occurs. The minor Pet Lex. gives the word two totally  
different explanations, under *nipriyāy* and *priyāy* respectively.

The God-created Cow belongs to those who come to ask for her. They call it outrage on the priests when one retains her as his own.
