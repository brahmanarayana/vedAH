### Translation
45. Homage be to thee, O Nārada; \[be\] the cow to him who at once knows  
it. Which one of them is the most fearful, not having given which, one  
would perish?

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **a** *te ‘stu*, and in **b** *vaśām*, which is easier  
(Ludwig translates ⌊as if the text were *vaśā́ḥ*⌋). In **d**, our text  
might better read *ádattvā*.

Homage, O Narada, to thee who hast quick knowledge of the cows. Which of these is the direst, whose withholding bringeth death to man?
