### Translation
25. The cow makes a man (*pū́ruṣa*) destitute of descendants, poor in  
cattle, if, when she is asked for by the Brahmans, then he keeps her to  
himself.

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **b** *pāuruṣam*, and in **d** *nu priyāyata*. The Anukr.  
takes no notice of any deficiency in **c**; we may best resolve  
*bṛ-āh-*. ⌊Read *brāhmaṇébhiś?*⌋
