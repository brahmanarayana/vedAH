### Translation
23. Whoever, not having given her to one who knoweth thus, then shall  
give the cow to others, hard to go upon for him in his station is the  
earth with its deity.

### Notes
In **b** the *pada*-text has *anyébhyaḥ: adadat*, and the *saṁhitā*-mss.  
correspondingly *-bhyo dadad v-;* this is emended in our text to *-bhyó  
‘d-* (as if *ádadat*, as in vs. 21); but a decidedly better emendation  
would be to *-bhyo dádat*, as translated. Ppp. reads *anyasmāi d-*,  
which favors this understanding of the pāda; it also combines *tasmā  
’dh-* in **c**.

Whoso to others, not to him who hath this knowledge, gives the Cow, Earth, with the Deities, is hard for him to win and rest upon.
