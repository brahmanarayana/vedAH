### Translation
19. Door-damaging (?) lies she on him, if he is not willing to give her  
when asked for; he does not succeed in the desires which, without having  
given her, he would fain accomplish (*cikīrṣa-*).

### Notes
The translation implies the obviously necessary emendation of *yā́m* to  
*yā́n* in **d** ⌊so Ludwig⌋. As to *duradabhnā́* at the beginning, see the  
note to vs. 4. That the conjectural rendering is extremely  
unsatisfactory is plain. Ppp. has instead, for **a**,  
*duritavīnapāśaye;* and, in **c, d**, apparently *kāmas sam ṛdhyate yam  
ad-*, thus supporting our emendation. ⌊In Ppp. this verse precedes our  
18.⌋

If he withholds the Cow they beg, she lies rebellious in his stall. Vain are the wishes and the hopes which he, withholding her, would gain.
