### Translation
6. Whoever punches (*ā-sku*) the two ears of her, he falls under the  
wrath of the gods; if he thinks "I am making a mark," he makes his  
possessions less.

### Notes
Ppp. begins *yo ‘syāṣ karṇāv āskanoty*, and reads in **c** *lakṣmīṣ  
kurvīta*. ⌊Pāda **b** recurs as 12 **c**. For the construction, cf. 26  
**d**, 47 **d**: and, *per contra*, 12 **d**, 34 **d**, and 51 **c**.⌋  
We are to make the combination *kurve ’ti*. ⌊As to the marking of  
cattle's ears, cf. vi. 141. 2 and note, and Zimmer, p. 234. In a  
marginal note, W. compares MS. iv. 2. 9 (p. 3¹⁵). The MS. passage and  
this vs. and the root *akṣ* are discussed by Delbrück,  
*Gurupūjākaumudī*, p. 48-49.—Ppp. puts the vs. between 4 and 5.⌋

Whoever twitches up her ears is separated from the Gods. He deems he makes a mark, but he diminishes his wealth thereby.
