### Translation
15. They come thus unto their own property, namely the Brahmans unto  
the cow; as one might scathe them in any other respect (?), so is the  
keeping back of her.

### Notes
The third pāda is unclear, and the bad meter makes the reading  
suspicious; yet Ppp. has the same, and varies only in combining  
*brāhmaṇā ’bhi* in **b**, and combining and reading *’syā ’dhirohaṇaṁ*  
in **d**. Most of our mss. (all except D. and R.s.ni.) have the false  
accent *brā́hmaṇās* in **b**; our text emends. The Anukr. takes no notice  
of the redundant syllable in **c**.

So when the Brahmans come unto the Cow they come unto their own. For this is her withholding, to oppress these in another life.
