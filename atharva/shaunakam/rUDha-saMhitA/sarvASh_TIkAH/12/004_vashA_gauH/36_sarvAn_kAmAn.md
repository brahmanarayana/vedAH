### Translation
36. All his desires, in Yama's realm, does the cow ⌊*vaśā́*⌋ yield to him  
who has presented her; likewise they call hell the world of him who  
keeps her back when asked for.

### Notes
The *pada*-text reads *nárakam*, and the difference of the two texts is  
noted in Prāt. iii. 21; iv. 90. Ppp. reads *tathā* for *atha* in **c**.

In Yama's realm the Cow fulfils each wish for him who gave her up; But hell, they say, is for the man who, when they beg, bestow her not.
