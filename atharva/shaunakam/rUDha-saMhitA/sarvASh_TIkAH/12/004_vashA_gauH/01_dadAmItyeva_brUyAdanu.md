### Translation
1. I give \[her\]—thus should he say, if they have noticed (?  
*anu-budh*) her—\[I give\] the cow (*vaśā́*) to the priests (*brahmán*)  
that ask for her; that brings progeny, descendants.

### Notes
Perhaps *ánu ábhutsata* is rather 'have recognized': i.e., have made her  
out to be the kind of cow that is called *vaśā́;* or there may be in it  
something of the meaning of *anu-jnā:* 'have approved, or taken a liking  
to.' ⌊Cf. MGS. i. 8. 6 and p. 150.⌋
