### Translation
49. The gods talked about the cow in wrath, saying: he hath not given  
it to us; with these verses (*ṛ́c*) \[they talked about\] Bheda;  
therefore indeed he perished.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Ppp. reads *upa* for *pari* in **a**, and, for **b**, *sa no rājata  
heḍitā;* and in **c** it rectifies the meter by giving *bhedasya*. The  
Anukr. does not heed the deficiency in our verse.

He gave her not to us, so spake the Gods, in anger, of the Cow. With these same verses they addressed Bheda: this brought him to his death.
