### Translation
4. Anæmia (*vilohitá*) from the station of the dung visits (*vid*) the  
master of kine; so is the agreement (?) of the cow; for door-damaging  
(?) art thou called.

### Notes
Nearly everything in the second half-verse is doubtful. The majority of  
our mss. read *sáṁvidyam* (p. *sám॰vidyam*), but *sā́ṁ-* instead is given  
by M.s.m.O.s.m. and D.; and in R. *sā́ṁ-* is emended to *sāṁ-*.  
*Sā́ṁvidya* seems a much more probable form of stem. The Pet. Lexx.  
render 'possession,' which is very unsatisfactory. *Duradabhnā́* (also in  
vs. 19) seems pretty clearly the reading of nearly all our mss. in  
**c**, though it might, as usual in such cases, be *-bhrā́* in most; Bp.  
has (both times) apparently *-bhdnā*, and O. ⌊in vs. 4⌋ *-bdnā* or  
*-b-h-nā* (the *b* and *h* separate letters, as again below in xiii. 1.  
25 **c**). The word is not divided in the *pada*-text. The translation  
given is ⌊suggested by⌋ that of the Pet. Lexx.; Ludwig renders here  
'unbetrieglich' (undeceivable), but leaves the word untranslated in vs.  
19. The second person *ucyáse* is quite unexpected; ⌊most of our⌋  
*saṁhitā*-mss. read *hy ū̀3cyáse;* ⌊and SPP's are much at variance⌋. ⌊As  
alternative rendering in **a, b**, W. notes 'from standing on her  
dung.'⌋ Ppp. reads, in **c, d**, *svāṁ vidyuṁ duritagrāhy uccase*.

Fierce fever where her droppings fall attacks the master of the kine. So have they named her Vasa, for thou art called uncontrollable.
