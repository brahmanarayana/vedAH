### Translation
39. She sends down great heat, going about a cow (*gó*) among kine;  
further, to the master who has not given her the cow (*vaśā́*) milks  
poison.

### Notes
In **b**, apparently, 'being treated as an ordinary cow.' The 'milks' in  
**d** does not necessarily mean that she gives actual milk. Ppp. reads  
*tato* in **c**, for *atho ha*, thus rectifying the meter; the Anukr.  
takes no notice of the redundancy of the pāda, caused by the apparently  
intrusive *ha*.
