### Translation
21. He incurs the wrath of cattle (*paśú*) who gives not the cow to the  
Brahmans—if a mortal keeps to himself the deposited portion of the gods.

### Notes
The *saṁhitā*-mss. accent in **b** *brāhmaṇébhyo dadat*, and the *pada*  
correspondingly *adadat* (instead of *ádadat*). Our text makes the  
necessary emendation. Ppp. gives for **d** *ṛtāse nu priyāyate*. ⌊See  
note to 11, above.⌋
