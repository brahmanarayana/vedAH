### Translation
34. In that, lying, I turn myself about upon the right \[or\] the left  
side, O earth (*bhū́mi*); in that we with our ribs lie stretched out upon  
thee that meetest us—do not in that case injure us, O earth (*bhū́mi*),  
thou underlier of everything.

### Notes
'Underlier,' lit. 'counter-lier, one whose lying answers to that of  
another.' In **a, b**, perhaps rather 'in that I turn over toward  
\[thee\] the one or the other side' ⌊cf. vii. 100. 1⌋. Our Bp. puts its  
sign of pāda-division between **c** and **d** before instead of after  
*yát*, and the Anukr. supports it by counting a *bṛhatī* element in the  
verse (which is properly 8 + 11: 8 + 8: 8 + 8 = 51). The verse is  
prescribed in Kaug. 24. 30, to accompany the act of turning over while  
lying down, in the *āgrahāyaṇī* ceremony. All the mss., with the  
edition, ⌊likewise SPP's mss. and ed.,⌋ accent *paryā´varte;* it should  
ht *paryāvárte*. Ppp. puts the verse after 35, and reads *api* for  
*abhi* in **b**; and, for **d**, *pṛṣṭvā yad ṛdva śemahe;* and *bhāume*  
both times for *bhūme*.

When, as I lie, O Earth, I turn upon my right side and my left, When stretched at all our length we lay our ribs on thee who meetest us. Do us no injury there, O Earth who furnishest a bed for all.
