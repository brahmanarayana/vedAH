### Translation
60. Whom Viśvakarman sought after with oblation within the ocean, when  
she was entered into the mist (? *rájas*); an enjoyable vessel that was  
deposited in secret became manifest in enjoyment (*bhóga*) for them that  
have mothers.

### Notes
Ppp. reads for *b* *yasyām āsann ugrayo* ⌊intending *agnayo?*⌋ *‘psv  
antaḥ;* and, in *c, d*, *guhā śāir āvir bhor abhavan mātṛmadbhiḥ:* which  
casts no light on the strange and obscure meaning.
