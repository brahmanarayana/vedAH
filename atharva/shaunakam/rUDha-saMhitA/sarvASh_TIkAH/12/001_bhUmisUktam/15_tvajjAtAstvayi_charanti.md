whom, mortals, the rising sun extends with his rays immortal light.

Produced from thee, on thee move mortal creatures: thou bearest them, both quadruped and biped. Thine, Prithivi, are these Five human Races, for whom, though mortal, Surya as he rises spreads with his rays the light that is immortal.
