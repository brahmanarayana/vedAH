### Translation
9. On whom the circulating waters flow the same, night and day, without  
failure—let that earth (*bhū́mi*), of many streams (*-dhā́rā*) yield  
(*duh*) us milk; then let her sprinkle \[us\] with splendor.

### Notes
The Anukr. does not heed that **c** is *jagatī* pāda. ⌊In Ppp., this  
verse precedes our 7.⌋

On whom the running universal waters flow day and night with never-ceasing motion, May she with many streams pour milk to feed us, may she bedew us with a flood of splendour.
