### Translation
52. On whom the black and the ruddy, combined, \[namely\] day-and-night,  
\[are\] disposed upon the earth (*bhū́mi*); the broad (*pṛthivī́*) earth  
(*bhū́mi*), wrapped \[and\] covered with rain—let her kindly (*bhadráyā*)  
set us in each loved abode.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *gṛṣṭam* for *kṛṣṇam* in **a**, reads and combines *saṁbhṛte  
‘horātre* in **a-b**, and reads *vṛtāvṛdhā* in **c**, and *dhāmnidhāmni*  
in **e**. In **c** is to be understood, with the *pada*-text, *vṛtā́:  
ā́॰vṛtā*. An accent-mark under the final *tā* is needed in order to  
indicate the acute of *sā́* in the next line. The verse (11 + 12: 12 + 8  
+ 8 = 51)is not well described by the Anukr. ⌊A *ca* with syllabic  
value, inserted after *kṛṣṇám*, would be an effective, albeit cheap,  
means of improving the meter of **a**.⌋ The verse is quoted in Kāuś. 24.  
41 (next after various of the preceding verses), as accompanying a  
mouth-rinsing and head-splashing with rainwater; and pāda **c**, again,  
in 137. 23, with a sprinkling with water.

Earth, upon whom are settled, joined together, the night and day, the dusky and the ruddy, Prithivi compassed by the rain about her, Happily may she stablish us in each delightful dwelling place.
