### Translation
19. Agni is in the earth (*bhū́mi*), in the herbs; the waters bear Agni;  
Agni \[is\] in the stones (*áśman*); Agni is within men; in kine, in  
horses are Agnis.

### Notes
This and the two following verses are quite out of connection here, and  
seem to be an intrusion. They are quoted together in Kāuś. 2. 41 as  
accompanying the feeding of the fire with fuel; in 120. 5, in a ceremony  
against the cleaving open of the ground; and in 137. 30 (each singly) to  
accompany the strewing of the sacrificial hearth in the *ājyatantra*.  
The first part of the verse (as noted above) is wanting in Ppp.

Agni is in the earth, in plants; the waters hold Agni in them, in the stones is Agni. Agni abideth deep in men: Agnis abide in cows and steeds.
