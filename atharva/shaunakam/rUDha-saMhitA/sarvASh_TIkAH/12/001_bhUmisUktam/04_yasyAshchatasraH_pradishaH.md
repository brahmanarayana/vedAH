### Translation
4. Whose, the earth's, \[are\] the four quarters; on whom food,  
plowings, came into being; who bears manifoldly what breathes, what  
stirs—let that earth (*bhū́mi*) set us among kine, also in  
inexhaustibleness (? *ánya*).

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Ppp. reads in **a** *yasyām* and *pṛthivyām*, and in **b** *gṛṣṭayas*  
⌊cf. note to ii. 13. 3⌋. As second half-verse it has our 5 **c, d**,  
giving our 4 **c, d** as 3 **c, d**, reading (after *bahudhā*) *prāṇine  
jan̄gano bhūmir goṣv aśveṣu pinve kṛṇotu*, thus relieving us of the  
difficult *ánye*. Kāuś. (137. 17) uses the verse next after vs. 2, in  
connection with making the sacrificial hearth four-cornered. The  
description given by the Anukr. of this and the two following verses is  
so wholly wrong that we cannot help suspecting a corrupt text. This  
verse is, if we make no resolutions in **d**, a regular triṣṭubh.

She who is Lady of the earth's four regions, in whom our food and corn-lands had their being, Nurse in each place of breathing, moving creatures, this Earth. vouchsafe us kine with milk that fails not!
