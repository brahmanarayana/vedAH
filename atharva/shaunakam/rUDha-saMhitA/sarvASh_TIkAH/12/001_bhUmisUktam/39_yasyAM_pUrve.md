### Translation
39. On whom the former being-making seers sang out (*ud-arc*) the  
kine—the seven pious ones (*vedhás*), by their session, together with  
sacrifice \[and\] penance;—

### Notes
Ppp. reads *udānāt* for *udānṛcus* in **b**; all our mss. accent *úd  
ānṛcús*, but the edited text has emended to *udān-*. Vāit. 22. 1 gives  
the verse as prescribed by a certain authority to be used instead of  
iii. 14. 2, in driving out the kine from the place of sacrifice.
