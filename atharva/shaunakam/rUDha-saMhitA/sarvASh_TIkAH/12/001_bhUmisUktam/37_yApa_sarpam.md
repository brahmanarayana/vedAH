### Translation
37. She who, cleansing one, trembling away the serpent; on whom were the  
fires that are within the waters, abandoning the god-insulting  
barbarians, choosing, she the earth, Indra \[and\] not Vṛitra, kept  
herself (*dhṛ*) for the mighty one (*śakrá*), the virile bull.

### Notes
The first pāda is extremely obscure; it is here translated mechanically,  
as closely as possible to the text. Bruce understands at the beginning  
*yā́: ā́pa* (instead of the *yā́: ápa* of the *pada*-text); and that would  
be a natural and easy emendation, if only the resulting sense were more  
acceptable. Ludwig renders as if we read *sárpāt* ('trembling at the  
serpent'). The totally different reading of Ppp., *ya āpas sarpan  
yatamānā vimṛgvari*, indicates that the text is corrupt. Ppp. further  
reads in **b** *agnayo ‘psv*, and stops the verse at *dadatī*, then  
adding our vs. 40. Our verse (12 + 11: 11 + 11: 11 = 56) adds up as a  
true *śakvarī*.

The purifier, shrinking from the Serpent, she who held fires that lie within the waters, Who gives as prey the God-blaspheming Dasyus, Earth choosing Indra for her Lord, not Vritra, hath clung to Sakra, to the Strong and Mighty.
