### Translation
36. Let thy hot season, O earth (*bhū́mi*), rainy season, autumn, winter,  
cool season, spring—let thine arranged seasons, years, let  
day-and-night, O earth, yield milk (*duh*) to us.

### Notes
One would expect in **c** *hāyanā́s* 'belonging to or constituting the  
year'; and Ppp., combining *hāyanā ’hor-*, favors that reading. Ppp. has  
also again *bhāume* in **a**. The irregularity of the verse (8 + 11: 10  
+ 11 = 40) indicates corruption; it is a *pan̄kti*, of course, only by  
the sum of syllables. It is quoted in Kāuś. 137. 9, as one approaches to  
measure out the sacrificial hearth. ⌊Cf. 137. 4, note.⌋

Earth, may thy summer, and thy rains, and autumn, thy winter, and thy dewy frosts, and spring-time. May thy years, Prithivi! and ordered seasons, and day and night pour out for us abundance.
