### Translation
7. She the earth (*bhū́mi pṛthivī́*), whom the gods, sleepless, defend all  
the time without failure—let her yield (*duh*) to us honey, what is  
dear; then let her sprinkle us with splendor.

### Notes
The verse is found also in MS. (iv. 14. 11), which reads in **c**  
*ghṛtám* instead of *priyám*.

May Earth, may Prithivi, always protected with ceaseless care by Gods who never slumber, May she pour out for us delicious nectar, may she bedew us with a flood of splendour.
