### Translation
48. Bearing the fool, bearer of what is heavy, enduring (*titikṣú*) the  
death (? *nidhána*) of the excellent and of the evil, the earth, in  
concord with the boar, opens itself to the wild (*mṛgá*) hog.

### Notes
Ludwig understands *gurubhṛ́t* in **a** as 'bearer of the wise' (*guru*  
as antithesis of *malva*); the Pet. Lexx. translate *nidhána* as  
'residence' (and so Bruce, 'abode'). Ppp. has at the beginning a very  
different text: *sarpaṁ bibhratī surabhir;* and it reads *sūkareṇa* in  
**c** and *varāhāya* in **d**.
