### Translation
2. Unoppressedness in the midst of men (*mānavá*). Whose are the ascents  
(*udvát*), the advances (*pravát*), the much plain (*samá*); who bears  
the herbs of various virtue (*nā́nāvīrya*)—let the earth be spread out  
for us, be prosperous for us.

### Notes
The mss, vary in **a** between *badhyatás* and *madhyatás* (Bp.P.M.I.  
have *ba-*), but only the latter can be right, and the translation  
adopts it; the former (which Ppp. also has, and *mānaveṣu*) seems to  
have come in under the influence of *-bādham*. ⌊Correct the edition.⌋ As  
the text stands, pāda **a** can only be an adjunct to vs. 1, and so Ppp.  
reckons it, and begins our **b** with *asyās*. But MS. (iv. 14. 11)  
reads *asambādhā́ yā́ madhyató mānavébhyo;* it also has *mahát* for *bahú*  
at end of **b**, and *nā́nārūpās* and *bibhárti* in **c**. This time the  
Anukr. notices that **b** has 12 syllables. Kāuś. 137. 16 quotes the  
verse ⌊in the preparation of the *vedi*⌋.

Not over awded by the crowd of Manu's sons, she who hath many heights and floods and level plains; She who bears plants endowed with many varied powers, may Prithivi for us spread wide and favour us.
