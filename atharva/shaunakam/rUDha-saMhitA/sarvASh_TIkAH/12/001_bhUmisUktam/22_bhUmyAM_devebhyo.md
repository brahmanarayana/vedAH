### Translation
22. On the earth (*bhū́mi*) they give to the gods the sacrifice, the  
oblation, duly prepared; on the earth (*bhū́mi*) mortal men (*manuṣyà*)  
live by *svadhā́*, by food; let that earth (*bhū́mi*) assign us breath,  
life-time; let earth make me one who attains old age.

### Notes
The verse (8 + 8: 8 + 8: 11 + 11 = 54) should be called by the Anukr.  
*svarāj* instead of *virāj*. Ppp. reads in **a** *juhvati* instead of  
*dadati*.

On earth they offer sacrifice and dressed oblation to the Gods. Men, mortals, live upon the earth by food in their accustomed way. May that Earth grant us breath and vital power. Prithivi give me life of long duration!
