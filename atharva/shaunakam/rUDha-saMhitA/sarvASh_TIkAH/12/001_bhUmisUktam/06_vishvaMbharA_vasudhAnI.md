### Translation
6. All-bearing, good-holding, firm-standing, gold-backed (*-vákṣas*),  
reposer of moving things (*jágat*), bearing the universal (*vāiśvānará*)  
fire, let the earth (*bhū́mi*), whose bull is Indra, set us in property.

### Notes
The verse is found also in MS. (iv. 14. 11), which reads, in **a-b**,  
*purukṣúd dhíraṇyavarṇā jágataḥ pratiṣṭhā́;* and in **d** *dráviṇam* (the  
editor also admits in his text the bad reading *índra ṛṣabhā́*). It is  
quoted in Kāuś. 137. 28. ⌊I do not see why W. has preferred  
'gold-backed' to 'gold-breasted' here and in vs. 26.⌋ ⌊By 'reposer' he  
means 'bringer-to-rest.'⌋
