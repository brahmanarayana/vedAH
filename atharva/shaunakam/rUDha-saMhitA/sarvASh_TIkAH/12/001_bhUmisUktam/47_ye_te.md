### Translation
47. What many roads thou hast, for people to go upon, a track  
(*vártman*) for the chariot, and for the going of the cart, by which  
(pl.) men of both kinds, excellent and evil, go about—that road, free  
from enemies, free from robbers, may we conquer; be thou gracious to us  
with that which is propitious.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *bahudhā* (for *bahavas*) in **a**, *yebhiś car-* at  
beginning of **c**, and *panthām* in **d**; and it omits the last pāda  
⌊repeated from vs. 46⌋. The *pratīka* (*ye te panthānaḥ*), quoted in  
Kāuś. 50. 1, might refer either to this verse or to vii. 55. 1; the  
comm. to vii. 55 declares the latter to be intended.

Thy many ways on which the people travel, the road for car and wain to journey over, Thereon meet both the good and bad, that pathway may we attain without a foe or robber. With all things gracious bless thou us.
