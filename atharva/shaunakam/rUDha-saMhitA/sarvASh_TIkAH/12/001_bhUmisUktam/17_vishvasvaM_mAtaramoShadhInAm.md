### Translation
17. The all-producing (*-sū́*) mother of herbs, the fixed earth  
(*bhū́mi*), the earth maintained by ordinance, the auspicious, the  
pleasant, may we go about over always.

### Notes
This verse (10 ⌊properly 11⌋ + 12: 12 = 34 syll.) is overlooked by the  
Anukr.; it nearly accords in structure with vs. 14, above. ⌊Dr. Ryder  
observes that the dual (*mahābṛhatyāu*) of the Anukr.-text suggests the  
possible falling out of the *pratīka* of this verse. See under vs. 14.⌋  
⌊There is a play of words in *dhármaṇā dhṛtā́m* which cannot easily be  
reproduced in translation.⌋

Kind, ever gracious be the Earth we tread on, the firm Earth, Prithivi, borne up by Order, mother of plants and herbs, the all-producer.
