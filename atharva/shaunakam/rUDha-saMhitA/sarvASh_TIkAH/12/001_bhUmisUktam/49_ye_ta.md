### Translation
49. What forest animals of thine, wild beasts set in the woods, lions,  
tigers, go about man-eating—the jackal (? *ulá*), the wolf, O earth,  
misfortune, the *ṛkṣī́kā*, the demon, do thou force (*bādh*) away from us  
here.

### Notes
The translation here given agrees with its predecessors in assuming  
emendation of *té* in **a** to *te*. Some of our mss. read in **c-d**  
*itá rakṣī́kām;* and Bp. has after it *ṛ́kṣaḥ*. Ppp. gives *eta rakṣīkāṁ  
rakṣo ‘pa bādhā mat;* and, at the beginning, *yatārṇyāṣ paś-;* ⌊and  
*ulaṁ* in **c** like our text⌋. With **a** compare the nearly identical  
xi. 2. 24 **a**; in spite of their agreement, one can hardly help  
regarding *mṛgās* as an intruded word. The Anukr. apparently accepts the  
two redundant syllables as making up for the deficiency in **b** and  
**d**, since 14 + 11: 12 11 = 48 syllables. ⌊As to the "man-eaters," cf.  
note to xv. 5. 7.⌋
