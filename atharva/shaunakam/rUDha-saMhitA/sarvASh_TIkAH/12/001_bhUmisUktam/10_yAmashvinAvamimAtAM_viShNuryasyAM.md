### Translation
10. Whom the Aśvins measured; on whom Vishṇu strode out; whom Indra,  
lord of might (*śacī-*), made free from enemies for himself—let that  
earth (*bhū́mi*) to us, a mother to a son, release (*vi-sṛj*) milk ⌊to  
me⌋.

### Notes
Some of the mss. read in **d** *-trā́ṅ chácī-*, and Bp. has accordingly  
*-trā́n*. Ppp. also has *cakrā ”tmane ‘namitrāṅ cchacī-;* and, at the  
end, *naṣ payaḥ*. ⌊Ppp's repetition of *nas* is more tolerable than the  
harsh change from pl. to sing, which W. seems to have overlooked.⌋

She whom the Asvins measured out, o'er whom the foot of Vishnu strode, Whom Indra, Lord of Power and Might, freed from all foemen for himself, May Earth pour out her milk for us, a mother unto me her son.
