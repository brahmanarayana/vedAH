### Translation
42. On whom is food, rice-and-barley; whose are these five races  
(*kṛṣṭí*)—to the earth, whose spouse is Parjanya, fattened (*-médas*) by  
the rain, be homage.

### Notes
With the irregular, but not infrequent, combination *yásye ’mā́ḥ* in  
**b**, the verse is a regular *anuṣṭubh;* for the epithet *svarāj* of  
the Anukr. there is no ⌊sufficient⌋ reason. Ppp. reads for **b** *yatre  
’māṣ pañca gṛṣṭayaḥ*, and ends with *-medhase*. Kāuś. uses the verse at  
24. 38 (next after vs. 38), and at 137. 24, with homage to the ⌊earth  
(*bhūmi*)⌋.
