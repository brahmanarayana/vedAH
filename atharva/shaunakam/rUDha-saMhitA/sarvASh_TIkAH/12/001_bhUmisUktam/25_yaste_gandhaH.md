### Translation
25. What odor of thine is in human beings (*púruṣa*); in women, in men,  
\[what\] portion, pleasure; what in horses, in heroes, what in wild  
animals and in elephants; what splendor, O earth (*bhū́mi*), in a  
maiden—with that do thou unite us also; let no one soever hate us.

### Notes
Or, in **d**, *mṛgeṣu hastiṣu* may mean simply 'elephants' (lit. 'wild  
beasts having a hand'). Ppp. reads *yas te bhāume puruṣeṣu...rucir yo  
vadhūṣu: yo goṣv aśveṣu yo mṛgeṣu:...yad bhāume abhi sāṁ sṛja;* and in  
**g** *dvakṣata*. If the verse contains an *uṣṇih* pāda (namely **c**,  
the resolution *aś-u-eṣu* being rejected), it is *nicṛt* as a *śakvarī*.
