### Translation
29. A gods' missile when being taken, failure when taken.

### Notes
The participles, especially the present passive ones, in these verses,  
are very much bungled over by the mss. For *hriyámāṇā*. here are read  
*hriy-*, *hrīy-*, *hṛy-*, *hiy-;* and Bp. has *ṛtā́* for *hṛtā́*. It is  
necessary to make the awkward renderings with 'being,' to distinguish  
present participle from past. The definition of the Anukr. implies the  
resolution *ví-ṛd-*.
