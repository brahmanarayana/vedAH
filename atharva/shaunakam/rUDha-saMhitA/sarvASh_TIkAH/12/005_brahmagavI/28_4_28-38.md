### Translation
28. \[She is\] hostility when being cut up, the eating of one's  
children when being shared out.

### Notes
Two of the *pada*-texts (D.Kp.) read *pāútra॰ādyam*. It is so difficult  
in most mss. to distinguish *dy* and *gh*, that the reading *pāútrāgham*  
(cf. *pāútram aghám*, xii. 3. 14), which Pet. Lex. conjectures as an  
emendation, might possibly be intended here.
