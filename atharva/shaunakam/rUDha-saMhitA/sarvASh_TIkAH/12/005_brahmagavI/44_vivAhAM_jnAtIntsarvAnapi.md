### Translation
44. All the marriages, acquaintances of the Brahman-scather does the  
Brahman-cow scorch (? *api-kṣā*), when not given back by a Kshatriya.

### Notes
Some of our mss. (O.D.T.R.) accent *-dīyámānā*, although part of them  
(O.T.R.) have accented *-tríyeṇā́ ’pun-*. The description of the passage  
(7 + 6: 8 + 10 = 31) by the Anukr. is very strange, and valueless.

The Brahman's cow, not restored by a Kshatriya, ruins the marriages and all the kinsmen of the Brahman's oppressor.
