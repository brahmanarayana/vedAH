### Translation
20. Keen-edged (*kṣurápavi*) when looking; when bellowing, she thunders  
at one.

### Notes
Bp. reads *vā́sya-*. Vss. 19 and 20 were perhaps intended as metrical (8  
+ 8). ⌊As to *mení*, vs. 16, cf. Geldner, *Festgruss an Böhtlingk*, p.  
32.⌋

Sharp as a razor when she beholdeth, she thundereth when she belloweth.
