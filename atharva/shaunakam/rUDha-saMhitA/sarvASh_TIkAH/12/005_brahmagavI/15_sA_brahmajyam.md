### Translation
15. This Brahman-cow, when taken to oneself, binds the Brahman-scather,  
the god-reviler, in the shackle of death.

### Notes
Several of the *saṁhitā*-mss. (Bs.P.M.W.E.) read *-gavy ā̀3dīyá-*,  
curiously enough. All our mss. have *páḍv-*, and one or two *-vīṅś-* or  
*-viṅś-*. The verse admits of being read as a *gāyatrī*, probably not by  
accident, and might better have been printed as such.
