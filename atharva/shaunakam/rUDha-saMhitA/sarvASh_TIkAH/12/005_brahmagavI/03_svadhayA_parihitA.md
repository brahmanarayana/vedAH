### Translation
3. Set about with *svadhā́*, surrounded with faith, guarded by  
consecration, standing firm in the offering, the world her post  
(*nidhána*).

### Notes
The *pada*-mss. absurdly write *práti॰stitāḥ* (instead of *-tā*). The  
metrical description of the Anukr. is not less absurd; to make the  
required 30 syllables, we have to resolve *pári-ūḍhā*.
