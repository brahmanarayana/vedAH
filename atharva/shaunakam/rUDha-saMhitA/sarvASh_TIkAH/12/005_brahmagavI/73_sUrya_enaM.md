### Translation
73. Let the sun thrust him forth from the sky, burn him down.

### Notes
The Anukr. accepts the resolution *ní oṣatu*.  
  
⌊The quotations from the Old Anukr. for the seven *paryāyas* may here be  
given together: I. *vacanāni ca ṣáṭ;* II. *pañca;* III. *ṣoḍaśa;* IV.  
*ekādaśa;* V. *aṣṭa ca;* VI. *brahmagavyām pañcadaśa;* VII. *tasmād  
dvādaśakaḥ paraḥ*. The sum is 73.—As is readily seen, these quotations  
together make an *anuṣṭubh śloka;* and they are printed in metrical form  
by SPP., vol. i., p. 21 (Critical Notice). For *vacanāni*, see above, p.  
472⌋  
  
⌊Here ends the fifth *anuvāka*, with 1 hymn (or 7 *paryāyas*) and 73  
*vacanas* or *vacana-avasānarcas*.⌋  
  
⌊By some mss. the book is summed up as of 4 *artha-sūktas* \[their vss.  
number 231\] and 7 *paryāya-sūktas* \[73 "verses"\], or as of "11  
*sūktas* of both kinds," with a total of 304 verses.⌋  
  
⌊The twenty-seventh *prapāṭhaka* ends here.⌋
