### Translation
38. When partaken of, the Brahman-cow cuts off the Brahman-scather from  
the world, from both this one and the one yonder.

### Notes
Bp. appears to read *lokā́n*, and M.R.T. correspondingly *-ā́ṅ ch-;* O.  
⌊D.Kp.⌋ have *-ā́t ch-;* the rest *-ā́ ch-*, which means *-ā́c ch-*, since  
*ch* and *cch* are equivalent and exchangeable. The metrical definition  
of the Anukr. is ambiguous.
