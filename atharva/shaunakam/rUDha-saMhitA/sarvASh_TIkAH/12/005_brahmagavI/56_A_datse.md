### Translation
56. Thou takest to thyself the honor of the scathers, their sacrifice  
and bestowal, their expectations.

### Notes
*Iṣṭám pūrtáṁ ca:* i.e., as later, the fruits of these good works. The  
Anukr. would have done much better to accept the resolution *ca āś-*,  
and reckon the verse as 16 syllables.

Thou bearest off the tyrants' strength, their store of merit, and their prayers.
