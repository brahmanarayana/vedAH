### Translation
50. Quickly, indeed, they ask about him: what that was, is this now  
that?

### Notes
We should expect rather *kíṁ tád āsī́3t* ⌊instead of *yát tád* etc.⌋,  
since without a question there is no good reason for the protracted *ī*.  
Ludwig translates as if that were the reading. O.D.R. accent *ā́sī́3d*, as  
is the rule in the Brāhmaṇas. Ppp. reads, after *pṛchanti*, *etad āsīd  
ataṁ nu dā*.
