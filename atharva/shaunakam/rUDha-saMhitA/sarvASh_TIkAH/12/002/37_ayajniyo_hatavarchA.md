### Translation
37. He becomes unfit for sacrifice, of smitten splendor; not by him is  
the oblation to be eaten; \[him\] the flesh-eating one cuts off from  
plowing, kine, riches, whom it pursues.

### Notes
Ppp. reads, in **a**, *ye agnayo* for *ayajñiyó;* and, in **c**, *kṛṣtiṁ  
gāṁ dhanaṁ*. Bp. has in **b** *ná: énena*. The *bhavati* which spoils  
the meter of **a** is doubtless an intrusion ⌊although Ppp. also has  
it⌋.

Unholy, splendour-reft is he, his sacrifice unfit to eat. Krayad deprives of tilth of cow, of riches him whom he pursues,
