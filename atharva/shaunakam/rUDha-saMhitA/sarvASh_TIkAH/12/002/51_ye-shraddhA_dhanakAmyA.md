### Translation
51. Whoever, without faith, from desire of riches then sit together with  
the flesh-eating one, they verily feed the fire (*ā-dhā*) about the pot  
(*kumbhī́*) of others ⌊always⌋.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
That is, doubtless, never have a fire of their own. The *pada*-text in  
**a-b** is *dhana॰kāmyā́: ā́t: kravya॰ádā;* Ppp. has a different reading,  
*-kāmyāṣ krav-*, thus getting rid of the difficult *ā́t*. ⌊The mark of  
pāda division is after at; it should be before it.⌋ The Anukr. seems to  
authorize the resolution *ṣa-ām* in **c**.

The faithless, who from lust of wealth abide with him who feeds on flesh, For ever set upon the fire an alien caldron, not their own.
