### Translation
44. Concealment of the gods, defense (*paridhí*) of men (*manuṣyà*), the  
householder's fire is set (*śritá*) between both classes.

### Notes
In accordance with the Anukr., the mss. interpose no stroke of  
interpunction in this verse, which plainly is not metrical, though the  
last 8 syllables read like an *anuṣṭubh* pāda. It is quoted, with others  
(see note to vs. 24), in Kāuś. 72. 13. Ppp. reads *ubhayād* in **c**.  
⌊The medial *avasāna* is lacking in SPP. and should be deleted from the  
Berlin ed.⌋

He who holds Gods within himself, the rampart and defence of men, Agni, the sacred household fire, hath come and stands between them both.
