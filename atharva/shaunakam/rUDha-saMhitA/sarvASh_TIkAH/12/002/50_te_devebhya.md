### Translation
50. They fall under the wrath of the gods, they live always evilly,  
after whom the flesh-eating fire, from near by, like a horse, scatters  
reeds.

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **a** *deveṣu*, and this is the usual and regular  
construction with *ā-vraśc*. Further, for **d** it has our 38 **d** and  
52 **d**. The Anukr. gives *iva* two syllables in **d**. Our Bp. reads  
*antikā́n* (instead of *-kā́t* here and in 38 **c** and 52 **c**. ⌊One  
could easily scan **d** as an *anuṣṭubh* pāda, *áśvevānvápate naḍám*  
(*Gram.* §233 a), if it were worth scanning.⌋

They sever from the Gods, they live in sin and misery evermore, Those whom from very near at hand Carnivorous Agni casteth down as a horse tramples down the reeds.
