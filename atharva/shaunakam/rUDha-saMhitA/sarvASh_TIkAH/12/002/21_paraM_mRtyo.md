### Translation
21. Go away, O death, along a distant road which is thine here, other  
than that the gods go upon; I speak to thee having sight, hearing; let  
these many heroes be here.

### Notes
The verse (except **d**) is RV. x. 18. 1, and found also in VS. (xxxv.  
7), TB. (iii. 7. 14⁵), and TA. (iii. 15. 2: vi. 7. 3). RV. has *svás*  
for our *eṣás* in **b**, and, for **d**, *mā́ naḥ prajā́ṁ rīriṣo mó ’tá  
vīrā́n*, and the other texts agree with it, save that VS. has *anyás* for  
*svás* in **b**. Ppp. omits *iha* in **d**. ⌊Cf. MB. i. 1. 15; also MGS.

Go onward, Death, pursue thy special pathway apart from that which Gods are wont to travel. To thee I say it who hast eyes and hearest: great grow the number of these men around us!
