### Translation
24. Mount, choosing old age for life-time, pressing on, one after  
another, as many as ye be; you here let Tvashṭar, him of good births, in  
accord \[with you\], lead on to living your whole life-time.

### Notes
The verse is (once more with exception of the last pāda) RV. x. 18. 6,  
and found also in TA. (vi. 10. 1). RV. reads *ṣṭha* after *yáti* in  
**b**, and *ihá* for *tā́n vas* in **c**, and its **d** is *dirghám ā́yuḥ  
karati jīváse vaḥ*. TA. differs from RV. by having *gṛṇānā́s* in **a**,  
*surátnas* (for *sajóṣās*) in **c**, and *karatu* in **d**. Ppp. puts  
the verse after our 25, and combines in **a-b** *vṛṇānā ’nu*. The verse  
is used in Kāuś. 72. 13 with vss. 21, 32, 44, 55, and others from  
elsewhere.

Live your full lives and find age delightful, all of you striving, one behind the other. May Tvashtar, maker of fair things, be gracious, and lead your whole lives on to full existence.
