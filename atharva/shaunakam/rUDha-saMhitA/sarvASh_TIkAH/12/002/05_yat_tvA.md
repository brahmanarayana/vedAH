### Translation
5. If angry men put thee forth (*pra-kṛ*), with fury, a man having died,  
that, O Agni, is easy to be arranged by thee; we make thee flame up  
again.

### Notes
Ppp. reads kṛtvā for *kruddhās* in **a**, *mite* for *mṛte* in **b**,  
and *ca* for *tat* in **c**. The Anukr. appears to sanction the  
resolution *cakṛ-ur* in **a**. The verse is quoted in Kāuś. 70. 6; also  
in Vāit. 5. 13, to accompany the removal of fire from the householder's  
to the other two fires.

When, angered that a man hath died, we in our wrath have banished thee, That deed is easily set right through thee: we kindle thee again.
