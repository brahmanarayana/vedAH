### Translation
25. As days take place (*bhū*) one after another, as seasons go along  
with seasons, as an after one does not desert (*hā*) a preceding—so, O  
creator (*dhā́tṛ*), arrange their life-times.

### Notes
This verse is RV. x. 18. 5, found also in TA. (vi. 10. 1). For *sākám*,  
at end of **b**, RV. reads *sādhú*, and TA. *kḷptā́ḥ*.

As the days follow days in close succession, as with the seasons duly come the seasons. As each successor fails not his foregoer, so constitute the lives of these, Ordainer!
