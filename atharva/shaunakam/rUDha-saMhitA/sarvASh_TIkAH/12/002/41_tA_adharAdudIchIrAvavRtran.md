### Translation
41. These fore-knowing ones (f.) have turned hither upward from below by  
roads that the gods go upon; upon the back of the virile (*vṛṣabhá*)  
mountain the ancient streams (*sarít*) go about new.

### Notes
'Waters' (*ā́pas*) is doubtless to be supplied with the adjectives in  
**a, b**. Ppp. combines *tā ’dharād* at the beginning, and reads  
*ṛṣabhasya* in **c**. It is doubtless by a blunder (*catasras* for  
*tisras*) that the Anukr. appears to reckon this regular *triṣṭubh* to  
the *anuṣṭubhs* of the hymn. The verse is quoted in Kāuś. 72. 3.

By pathways travelled by the Gods these waters, well-knowing, from below have mounted upward. High on the summit of the raining mountain the ancient rivers fresh and new are flowing.
