### Translation
28. Take ye hold on that of all the gods in order to splendor, becoming  
cleansed, clear, purifying; stepping over difficult tracks, may we revel  
a hundred winters with all our heroes.

### Notes
The first half-verse is identical with vi. 62. 3 **a, b**, save that the  
latter begins with *vāiśvānarī́m*. We have doubtless to supply *nā́vam*  
'boat.' But Ppp. has *sūnṛtām* for *varcase* in **a**; and the comm. to  
Nirukta vi. 12 quotes the *pratīka* in this form, explaining *sūnṛtām*  
by *vācam* (Roth). According to Kāuś. 72. 6, it is a young heifer  
(*vatsatarī*) that is caused to be laid hold on.

Becoming pure and bright and purifying begin the Vaisvadevi strain for splendour.. May we rejoice, o'erpassing troublous places, with all our heroes through a hundred winters.
