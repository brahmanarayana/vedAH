### Translation
30. Come ye, obstructing the track of death, assuming further on a  
longer life-time; sitting in your station, thrust ye \[away\] death;  
then may we, living, speak to the council.

### Notes
The first half-verse is RV. x. 18. 2 **a, b**, and is found also in TA.  
(vi. 10. 2); for our *é ’ta*, RV. reads *yád āíta*, TA. *yád āima*  
(*āima* unaccented, unless there is a misprint ⌊Poona ed. rightly  
*āíma*, p. 444⌋); and TA. has *pratarā́m* in **b**. ⌊Cf. MGS. ii. i. 13  
and p. 153.⌋ The verse is quoted in Kāuś. 71. 20 and 86. 23 in  
connection with doing something to (symbolical) boats; and the second  
half-verse in Kāuś. 72. 10. Ppp. reads *pratiram* in **b**, and *jīvās*  
in **d**, thus in the latter pāda rectifying the meter. The Anukr. takes  
no notice of the irregularities in **a** and **d**, perhaps because they  
balance each other. ⌊As to *vidátham*, cf. note to vs. 22, and  
Bloomfield in JAOS. xix.² 14.⌋
