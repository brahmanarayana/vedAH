### Translation
43. The flesh-eating one entered into this man; he has gone after the  
flesh-eating one; having made two tigers severally, I take him, who is  
other than propitious.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *pra viveśa* in **a**, and *nānā ’haṁ* in **c**. The verse is  
quoted, with others (see note to vs. 1), in Kāuś. 71. 8.
