### Translation
2. By evil-plotter and ill-plotter, by actor and helper, both all  
*yákṣma* and death do we thereby drive out from here.

### Notes
Ppp. reads in **c, d** *mṛtyūṅś ca sarvāṅs tene ’to yakṣmāṅś ca nir*  
etc. The first half-verse is like a half-verse in MS. iv. 14. 17; TA.  
ii. 47: *duḥśansānuśaṅsā́bhyāṁ ghanénā ’nughanéna ca* ⌊cf. *Kaṭha-hss.*,  
p. 72⌋.
