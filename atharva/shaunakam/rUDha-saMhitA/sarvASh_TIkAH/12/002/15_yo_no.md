### Translation
15. The flesh-eating one that is in our horses, heroes, that is in our  
kine, goats-and-sheep, do we thrust out—the fire that obstructs the

### Notes
Ppp. combines in **a** *no ‘śv-*, and reads for **b** *yo goṣu yo  
‘jāviṣu;* ⌊and puts the verse after 16⌋. This verse and the one  
following are quoted with others (see note to vs. 1) in Kāuś. 71. 8.
