### Translation
31. Let these women, not widows, well-spoused, touch themselves with  
ointment, with butter; tearless, without disease, with good treasures  
(*-rátna*), let the wives ascend first to the place of union (*yóni*).

### Notes
This verse is repeated below, as xviii. 3. 57. It is RV. x. 18. 7, and  
found also in TA. (vi. 10. 2). RV. has *viśantu*, and TA. *mṛśantām*,  
for our *spṛśantām* in **b**, and TA. *suśévas* for *surátnās* in **c**;  
RV. also combines *anaśrávo ‘nam-* in **c**. Ppp. reads *saṁ viśanta* in  
**b**; and it adds another corresponding verse for the men: *ime vīrar  
avidhavās sujānayā narā ”ñjanena sarpiṣā* etc. (**d**) *syonād yoner  
adhi talpaṁ vṛheyuḥ* ⌊intending *ruheyuḥ*⌋. With our verse, in Kāuś. 72.  
11, grass shoots dipped in butter are handed to the women; and 72. 12  
appears to quote the Ppp. verse (the *pratīka* is given as *ime jīvā  
avidhavāḥ sujāmaya*) to accompany a similar act to the men.
