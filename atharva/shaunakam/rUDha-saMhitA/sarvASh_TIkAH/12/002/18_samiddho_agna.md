### Translation
18. Being kindled, O Agni, thou to whom oblations are made, go (*kram*)  
thou not away against us; shine just here by day, and that \[we\] long  
see the sun.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Or *dyavi*, in **c**, 'in the sky' (so Ludwig). The last pāda is also i.  
6. 3 **d**. ⌊Cf. also note to vi. 19. 2.⌋ There is no good reason for  
calling the verse *nicṛt*.
