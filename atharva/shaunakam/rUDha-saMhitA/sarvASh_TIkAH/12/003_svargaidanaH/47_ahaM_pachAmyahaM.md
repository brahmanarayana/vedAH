### Translation
47. I cook; I give; verily upon my action \[and\] deed (? *karúṇa*) the  
wife; a virgin (? *kāúmāra*) world hath been born, a son; take ye (du.)  
hold after vigor (*váyas*) that hath what is superior.

### Notes
The translation here is purely mechanical. Ppp. puts the verse after our  
vs. 48, and reads in **a**, for *dadāmi*, *ud vadāmi* ⌊thus suggesting  
the probably correct restoration of the pāda (*aham u dadādmi*)⌋, and in  
**c** *putrās*. The verse (10 + 11: 11 + 11 = 43) is very ill described  
by the Anukr.

I cook the offering, I present oblation: only my wife attends the holy service. A youthful world, a son hath been begotten. Begin a life that brings success and triumph.
