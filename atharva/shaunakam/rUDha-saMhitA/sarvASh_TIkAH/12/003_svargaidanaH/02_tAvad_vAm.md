### Translation
2. So much \[be\] your sight, so many your powers (*vīryà*), so great  
your brilliancy (*téjas*), so many-fold your energies (*vā́jina*); Agni  
fastens on (*sac*) the body when \[it is his\] fuel (?); then, O paired  
ones (*mithuná*), shall ye come into being from what is cooked  
(*pakvá*).

### Notes
The *pada*-text has *yadā́: édhaḥ* in **c**, as translated. Ppp. reads  
before it *agniṁ śarīraṁ sajate*, and after it *atha;* and in **a, b**  
it makes *cakṣus* and *tejas* change places. ⌊In OB. V. 258, *pakvá* is  
defined as 'the charred remains and ashes of a corpse.' Pāda **d**  
recurs in vs. 9.⌋ ⌊W. makes a query on the margin: "the husband and wife  
burnt together?? and born anew and alike out of the cremation?"⌋

So strong your sight, so many be your powers, so great your force, your energies so many, When fire attends the body as its fuel, then may, ye gain full chargers, O ye couple.
