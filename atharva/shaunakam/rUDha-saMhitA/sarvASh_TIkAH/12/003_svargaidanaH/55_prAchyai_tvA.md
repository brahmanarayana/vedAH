### Translation
55. To the eastern quarter, to Agni as overlord, to the black  
\[serpent\] as defender, to Āditya having arrows, we commit thee here;  
guard ye him for us until our coming; may he lead on our appointed  
\[life-time\] here unto old age; let old age commit us unto death; then  
may we be united with the cooked \[offering\].

### Notes
⌊Vss. 55-60 are partly unmetrical.⌋ We are surprised to find the pause  
before instead of after the phrase *etám pári dadmaḥ*. With the items in  
the first division of these verses are to be compared the corresponding  
ones in iii. 27. 1-6. The concluding pāda of the metrical refrain is  
identical with vi. 119. 2 **d**. The *pada*-reading at the end of the  
prose is *ā́: asmā́kam: ā́॰etoḥ*. In every verse, Ppp. omits *tvā* before  
*diśé* (an improvement) and reads *dadhmas* for *dadmas*. In the refrain  
⌊of every verse, apparently⌋, it has *dadhātv adhā* for *dadātv atha*.  
In this verse it combines *diśe agnaye*. The metrical description of the  
Anukr. is very puzzling; the part common to all the verses is 6 + 10: 11  
+ 11 + 11 = 49 syllables; then the varying parts range ⌊with some  
resolutions⌋ from 25 to 31 syllables: all together, from 74 to 8o  
syllables; and *atidhṛti* is regularly 76, and *kṛti* 80; but the  
Anukr., after calling all *atidhṛti*, appears to call all but one  
*kṛti*. The verses are quoted in Kāuś. 63. 22, in connection with the  
rest of the hymn.

To the eastern region, to Agni the Regent, to Asita the Protector, Aditya the Archer, we present thee, this offering of ours. Do ye preserve it from aggression To full old age may Destiny conduct us; may full old age deliver us to Mrityu. Then may we be with our prepared oblation.
