### Translation
24. Let Agni, cooking, defend thee on the east; let Indra, with the  
Maruts, defend on the south; may Varuṇa fix thee in the maintenance  
(*dharúṇa*) of the western \[quarter\]; on the north may Soma give thee  
together.

### Notes
Ppp. corrects the meter of **b** by reading *rakṣāt;* and that of **d**  
by having *varuṇas* instead of *somas*. The verse is irregular, but by  
no means a *jagatī*. ⌊If we make *varuṇas* and *somas* exchange places,  
as suggested by Ppp., and read *rakṣāt* with Ppp., the vs. becomes a  
good triṣṭubh.⌋ In Kāuś. 61. 32 it is used when arranging the fire about  
the kettle.

Eastward may Agni as he cooks preserve thee. Southward may Indra, grit by Maruts, guard thee, Varuna strengthen and support thee westward, and Soma on the north hold thee together.
