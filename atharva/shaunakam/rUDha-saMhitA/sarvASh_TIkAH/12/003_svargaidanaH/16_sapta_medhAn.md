### Translation
16. Seven sacrifices (*médha*) the cattle enclosed—which ⌊*the relative  
pronoun*⌋ of them was full of light, and which was pining; to them  
thirty deities attach themselves; do thou (m.) conduct us (pl.) unto the  
heavenly (*svargá*) world.

### Notes
Our Bp. reads tarn in **c**, and a few of the *saṁhitā*-mss. (P.M.W.E.)  
agree with it; *tā́m* is certainly wrong, but *tám* would be an  
acceptable improvement. Ppp. has *medhasvān* instead of *jyotiṣmān* (and  
the latter must be taken as having the sense of the former); also  
*cakarṣa* in **b**, and *neṣi* in **d**. ⌊For *neṣa*, see *Gram.* §  
896.⌋ The verse is quoted in Kāuś. 61. 13, to accompany the handling or  
stroking of something by the two spouses ⌊with their offspring⌋. Pāda  
**b** has a redundant syllable, unnoticed by the Anukr., unless we  
contract to *yāi ’ṣām*.

Seven victims held the sacrificial essence, the bright one and the one that hath grown feeble. The three-and-thirty Deities attend them. As such, conduct us io the world of Svarga.
