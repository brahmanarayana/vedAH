### Translation
49. May we do what is dear to them that are dear; whosoever hate \[us\],  
let them go to darkness; milch-cow, draft-ox, each coming vigor  
(*váyas*)—let them thrust away the death that comes from men.

### Notes
Or, 'that concerns, comes upon, men' (*pāúruṣeya*). The Anukr. seems to  
accept the two redundant syllables of **c** (*evá* an intrusion) as  
compensating for the deficiency in **a**. According to Kāuś. 62. 19, the  
verse is used of 'the milch-cow etc.' north of the fire.

To those we love may we do acts that please them. Away to darkness go all those who hate us! Cow, ox, and strength of every kind approach us! Thus let them banish death of human beings.
