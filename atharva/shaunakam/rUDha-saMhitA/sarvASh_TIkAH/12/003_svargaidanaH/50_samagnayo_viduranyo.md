### Translation
50. The fires ire in concord, one with another—he that fastens on the  
herbs, and he that \[fastens on\] the rivers; as many gods as send heat  
(*ā-tap*) in the sky—gold hath become the light of him that cooks.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *sindhum* in **b**, and *dadhatu*\* (for *pacatas*) in **d**.  
In Kāuś. 62. 22, the verse (with xi. 1. 28) is made to accompany the  
laying on of a piece of gold; it is also quoted in 68. 27, with vss.  
46-48, etc.: see note to vs. 46. The Anukr. does not notice the lack of  
a syllable in **a**. \*⌊Intending *dadhato?*⌋

Perfectly do the Agnis know each other, one visitor of plants and one of rivers, And all the Gods who shine and glow in heaven. Gold is the light of him who cooks oblation.
