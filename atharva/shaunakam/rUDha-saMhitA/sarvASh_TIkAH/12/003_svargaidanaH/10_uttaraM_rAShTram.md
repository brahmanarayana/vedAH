### Translation
10. A superior realm, having superiority by progeny, may the northern of  
the quarters make our (pl.) apex (? *ágra*); a five-fold (*pā́n̄ta*) meter  
hath the man become; may we come into being together with all, having  
all their limbs.

### Notes
Ppp. reads *pan̄ktiś chandaṣ* at the beginning of **c**. We have to  
resolve *pa-ān-* in order to make a full pāda.
