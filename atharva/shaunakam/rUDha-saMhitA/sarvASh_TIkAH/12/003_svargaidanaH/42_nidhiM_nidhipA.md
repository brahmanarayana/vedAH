### Translation
42. He shall seek unto it, \[as\] treasure-keepers unto a treasure; let  
those who are others be not lords (*ánīśvara*) about; given by us,  
deposited, heaven-going, with three divisions it has ascended to three  
heavens (*svargá*).

### Notes
Ppp. again combines in **a** *-pā ’bhy*. Kāuś. 62. 10 makes the verse  
accompany the division of the rice-dish into three parts. There is no  
reason for calling it *bhurij*, as the Anukr. does.

The Lord of Treasures may desire this treasure: lordless on. every side be all the others. Our mess, presented seeking heaven, hath mounted in three divisions all three realms of Svarga.
