### Translation
52. What \[untruth\] thou shalt speak at the dice, what at the meeting,  
or what untruth thou shalt speak from desire of gain—clothing yourselves  
(du.) in the same web (*tántu*), ye shall settle in it all pollution.

### Notes
Ppp. rectifies the meter of **a** by reading *vadasi;* in **b** it has  
*dhane* instead of *vadās;* in **c** it gives *saha* for *abhi*. The  
Anukr. does not notice the deficiency in **a**. The verse is quoted in  
Kāuś. 63. 1 (next after vs. 51), with the explanation 'the two become  
dressed in the same garment.' ⌊With **a**, cf. 46 **c**.⌋

Whatever thou may say at dice, in meeting, whatever falsehood through desire of riches, Ye two, about one common warp uniting, deposit all impurity within it.
