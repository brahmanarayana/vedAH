### Translation
46. Unto truth, unto penance, and unto the deities, we deliver this  
deposit (*nidhí*), \[this\] treasure (*śevadhí*); let it not be lost  
(*ava-gā*) in our play, nor in the meeting; do not ye release it to  
another in preference to (*purā́*) me.

### Notes
One or two of our mss. (R.D.) accent at the end *mát;* and the word is  
not found without accent unless here and at xi. 4. 26. ⌊SPP. reads *mát*  
with 8 of his authorities, against 7 that have *mat*.⌋ Ppp. reads in  
**b** *dadhmas*. This and the two following verses are quoted, with a  
number of others, in Kāuś. 68. 27, at a later point in the rice-dish  
ceremony. ⌊With **c**, cf. 52 **a**.⌋
