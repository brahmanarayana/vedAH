### Translation
43. Let Agni burn the demon that is godless; let the flesh-eating  
*piśācá* not have a draught here; we thrust him, we bar him away from  
us; let the Ādityas, the An̄girases, fasten on him.

### Notes
Doubtless we should emend to *rundhmas* in **c**. Ppp. reads in **d**  
*ādityā no an̄g-*, thus rectifying the meter. The Anukr. notices this  
time the redundance of the pāda. Doubtless, as often elsewhere, we are  
to contract to *ādityāí ’nam*. In Kāuś. 62. 14 the verse is made to  
accompany the carrying of fire around the offering. ⌊BR. render the  
force of *pra* by defining *pra-pā* as 'sich an's Trinken machen.'⌋

May Agni burn the God-denying demon: let no carnivorous. Pis icha drink here. We drive him off, we keep him at a distance. Adityas and Angirases pursue him!
