### Translation
34. In sixty autumns may he (?) seek unto the treasure-keepers; may he  
attain unto the sky with the cooked \[offering\]; may both fathers  
\[and\] sons live upon him; make thou this one to go unto the  
heaven-going end of the fire.

### Notes
The last pāda admits of various other constructions. Both here and in  
vs. 41 (where pāda **a** is repeated) Bp. reads at the beginning  
*śaṣṭhyā́m*. In **c**, O.p.m.R. accent *jīvā́n*. Ppp. puts the verse after  
our vs. 35, and reads, for **a**, *ṣaṣṭyām śaradbhyaṣ paridadhma enam;*  
for **c**, *upāi ’naṁ putrān pitaraś ca sīdām;* in **d**, *imam* for  
*etam*. There is no reason why the Anukr. should regard the verse as  
anything but a regular *triṣṭubh*. In Kāuś. 62. 9 it accompanies the  
setting down of the rice-dish westward from the fire.

In sixty autumns may the Treasure-Guardian seek to gain heavenly light by cooked oblation. On this may sons and fathers live dependent. Send thou this mess to Fire that leads to heaven.
