### Translation
8. Attaining unto the southern quarter, turn ye (du.) about unto this  
vessel; in it shall Yama, in concord with the Fathers, assure abundant  
protection unto your cooked \[offering\].

### Notes
'In it': i.e., as the gender shows, in the vessel. Some of our mss. make  
very bad work with *vām* in **c**, reading *vāyám* (P.M.W.), *vayám*  
(Bs.s.m.), *varā́m* (R.), *vāṁ yam* (T.). It is absurd of the Anukr. to  
reckon the verse (11 + 11: 12 + 11 = 45) a *jagatī*.
