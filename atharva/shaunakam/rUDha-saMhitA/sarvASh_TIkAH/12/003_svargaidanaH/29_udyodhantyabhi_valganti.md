### Translation
29. They struggle up (*ud-yudh*), they dance on, being heated; they hurl  
foam and abundant drops (*bindú*); like a woman that is in her season,  
seeing her husband, unite yourselves, O waters, with these rice-grains.

### Notes
The translation assumes the emendation, made in our edited text, of  
*ṛ́tviyā yā́*, for the *ṛ́tviyāya* of all the mss. ⌊See SPP's note on this  
matter, p. 231. He says *ṛtviya* = *māithuna*. Ppp. reads *ṛtviyāvāis  
tāis taṇḍ-*. In Kāuś. 61. 37 the verse accompanies the making of the  
water to boil.
