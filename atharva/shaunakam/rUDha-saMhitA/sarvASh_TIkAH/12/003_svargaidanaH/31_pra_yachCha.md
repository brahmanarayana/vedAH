### Translation
31. Reach thou forth the sickle (*párśu*), hasten, take \[it\] quickly;  
let them, not harming, cut (*dā*) the herbs at the joint; they of whom  
Soma compassed the kingship—let the plants be without wrath toward us.

### Notes
One or two of our mss. read in **a** *páraśum* (M.W.; O. *párárśum*);  
and, as usual, some (O.D.R.) accent *rā́jyam* in **c**. Ppp. has  
*harantu* for *harāu ’ṣam* in **a**; and, in **c**, *soma yāsām*.  
*Amanyutāḥ* is undivided in the *pada*-text. In Kāuś. 61. 38 the first  
pāda is used with handing over the sickle for gathering the  
*darbha*-grass; the second pāda,\* in 61. 39, with cutting it above the  
joints; and in 1. 24, 25 both for a similar purpose; so also the first  
pāda (or the verse) in 8. 11; and yet again both in the comm. to 137. 4.  
\*⌊Quoted as *oṣadhīr dāntu parvan* at i. 25 and 61. 39. According to  
Daś. Kar. (note to 137. 4), the quotation *pra yacha parśum* covers a  
pāda and a half, that is, it includes the *ahiṅsantas* which is omitted  
in the quotation of **b**.⌋

Present the sickle: quickly bring it hither. Let them out plants and joints with hands that harm not. So may the plants be free from wrath against us, they o'er whose realm Soma hath won dominion.
