### Translation
30. Make thou them stand up, as they sit on the bottom; let them touch  
themselves all over with the waters; I have measured with vessels  
(*pā́tra*) the water that is here; measured are the rice-grains that are  
these directions.

### Notes
The last pāda is translated as if *yádīmā́ḥ* (p. *yádi imā́ḥ*) were meant  
as equivalent to *yád imā́ḥ*, corresponding to the *yád etát* of **c**.  
Ppp. has *sṛjantām* at end of **b**.  
  
⌊Here, at the end of a decad-division, ends the twenty-sixth  
*prapāṭhaka*.⌋

Take up these rice-grains lying at the bottom: led them be blent and mingled with the waters. This water I have measured in the vessel, if as mid-points the rice-grains have been meted.
