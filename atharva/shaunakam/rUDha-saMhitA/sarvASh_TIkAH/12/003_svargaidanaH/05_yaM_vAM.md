### Translation
5. What one your (du.) father cooks, and what one \[your\] mother, in  
order to release from evil (*riprá*) and from pollution of speech—that  
hundred-streamed, heaven-going rice-dish hath permeated (*vi-āp*) with  
greatness both firmaments (*nábhas*).

### Notes
Ppp. reads at the beginning *yaṁ vaṣ pitā*.

That which your mother and your sire, to banish sin and un- cleanness from their lips, are cooking. That Odana with hundred streams, sky-reaching, hath in its might prevaded earth and heaven.
