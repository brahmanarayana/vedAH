### Translation
54. The heaven-goer hath variously changed his body, as he finds (?  
*vidé*) in himself one of another color; he hath conquered off the black  
one, purifying a shining one (*rúśat*); the one that is red, that I  
offer (*hu*) to thee in the fire.

### Notes
The adjectives here are all fem., relating to 'body' (*tanū́*). The  
defective meter of **b** helps to make the isolated ⌊or rather,  
unusual?⌋ *vidé* ⌊see *Gram.* §613⌋ suspicious; the Anukr. takes no  
notice of the deficiency. The first half-verse is corrupt in Ppp., so  
that the comparison gives us no help. In Kāuś. 63. 8 the verse  
accompanies the scattering on of other husks (*phalīkaraṇān*). ⌊For the  
form *ajāit*, see the references under vi. 32. 2.⌋

In many a shape hath heaven transformed its body, as in itself is known, of varied eolour. Cleansing the bright, the dark form hath it banished: the red form in the fire to thee I offer.
