### Translation
19. About to become all-expanded, ghee-backed, go thou, of like origin  
(*sáyoni*), unto that world; hand thou (*upa-yam*) the rain-increased  
sieve; let that winnow away the husk, the chaff.

### Notes
The first half-verse is identical with 53 **c, d** below. Some mss.  
(I.O.D.K.: also half of the Kāuś. mss.) read *palā́vām* in **d**. Ppp.  
has *vidvān* instead of *etam* in **b**. With **c**, according to Kāuś.  
61. 23, the *śūrpa* is grasped; with **a** (or the whole verse?),  
according to 24, it is raised; with **d**, according to 25, the sifting  
is done. The third pāda lacks a syllable, unless we may resolve  
*śu-úrpam*. ⌊For "sieve," here and in vs. 20, read rather  
"winnowing-basket"?⌋

Soon to be, decked with butter, all-embracing, come to this world wherewith birth unites thee. Seize thou the winnowing-fan which rains have nourished, and let this separate the chaff and refuse.
