### Translation
32. Strew ye a new *barhís* for the rice-dish; be it dear to the heart,  
agreeable to the eye; on it let the gods \[and\] the divine ones (f.)  
settle (*viś*) together; sitting down (*ni-sad*), let them partake of  
this with the seasons.

### Notes
The mss. read in **b** *priyā́m*, but our text makes the unavoidable  
emendation to *-yám*. Some of the mss. also are bothered over the  
unusual combination *lgva* in **b**: ⌊thus Bs. has *vaglàv astu;* R.  
*valgáv astu;* T. *valgvustu*. And again, in **d**, Bs. reads *-śnan  
ṛ́t-*, and O.s.m.R. *-śnanty ṛt-*. The verse accompanies in Kāuś. 61. 40  
the strewing of the *barhis*.

Strew ye fresh grass for the boiled rice to rest on: fair let it be, sweet to the eye and spirit. Hither come Goddesses with Gods, and sitting here taste in proper season this oblation.
