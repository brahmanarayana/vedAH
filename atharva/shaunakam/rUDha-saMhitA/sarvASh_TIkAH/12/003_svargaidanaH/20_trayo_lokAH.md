### Translation
20. The three worlds are commensurate with the *brā́hmaṇa:* yon heaven,  
namely, earth, atmosphere; having seized the \[soma-\] stalks, take ye  
(du.) hold after; let them swell up (*ā-pyā*); let them come again to  
the sieve.

### Notes
All our mss. (except D.) read *asāu*, unaccented, in **b**; emendation  
to *asāú* was plainly necessary. All the *saṁhitā*-mss. (except E.)  
separate in **c** *gṛbhītvā́ anv-*, which, accordingly, might perhaps as  
well have been left, though the Prāt. does not recognize the case of  
irregular hiatus. Ppp. seems to combine the two words in the usual  
fashion; but it has *-rabhetām;* also, in **b**, *pṛthivyām ant-*. The  
verse is quoted in Kāuś. 61. 27 in connection with touching the winnowed  
grains (?); and, in 28, the last words of **d** (*punar* etc.), with  
scattering them, apparently, again on the sieve.

Three worlds hath Power Divine marked out and measured, Fheaven yonder, and the earth, and airs mid-region. Grasp ye the stalks and in your hands retain them: let them be watered and again be winnowed.
