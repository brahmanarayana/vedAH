### Translation
6. Both firmaments, and worlds of both kinds, what heaven-going ones are  
conquered of the sacrificers—which one of them is chiefly (? *ágre*)  
full of light, full of honey, in that combine ye (du.) with your sons in  
old age.

### Notes
Ppp. combines in **c** *yo ‘gre*, and part of our mss. (P.M.W.T.) read  
the same.

Live with your sons, when life on earth is ended, live in the sphere most rich in light and sweetness. In skies that have been won by sacrificers make both the worlds, earth, heaven, your habitation.
