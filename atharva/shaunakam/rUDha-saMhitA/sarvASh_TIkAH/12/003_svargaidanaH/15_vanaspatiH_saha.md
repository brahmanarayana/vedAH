### Translation
15. The forest tree hath come to us together with the gods, forcing off  
the demon, the *piśācás;* he shall rise up (*ut-śri*), shall speak forth  
his voice; with him may we conquer all worlds.

### Notes
Ppp. reads and combines *sāu ’cchrāyātāi* in **c**, and reads *api* for  
*abhi* in **d**. According to Kāuś. 61. 21, one sets up the pestle with  
this verse; in 125. 3 the verse is used with reference to the  
sacrificial post ⌊in case it puts forth fresh shoots⌋; and similarly in  
Vāit. 10. 8 ⌊in the *paśubandha*⌋.
