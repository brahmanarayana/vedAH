### Translation
1. Stand, a man (*púmāṅs*), upon men; go to the hide; call thither her  
who is dear to thee; of what age (? *yā́vant*) ye two first came together  
in the beginning, let that be your same age in Yama's realm.

### Notes
Ppp. combines *puṅso adhi* and omits *ihi* in **a**. Kāuś. 60. 31 has  
the verse used when the sacrificer is made to stand upon the ox-hide  
which is to be his station during the ceremony. The various antecedents  
have been prepared to the accompaniment of the first verses of xi. 1.

Mount, male from male, the skin. Go thither: summon those whom thou lovest, one and all, to meet thee, Strong as ye were when first ye met each other, still be your strength the same in Yama's kingdom.
