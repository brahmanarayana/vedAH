### Translation
28. The numbered drops (*stoká*) fasten on the earth, being commensurate  
with breaths-and-expirations, with herbs; being scattered on,  
unnumbered, of good color, the clean ones have obtained all cleanness.

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
This verse, as noted above, is wanting in Ppp. It is quoted in Kāuś. 61.  
36 to accompany the scattering in of the rice-grains after washing.
