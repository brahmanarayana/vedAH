### Translation
18. The seizure (*grā́hi*), evil (*pāpmán*)—may we go beyond them (pl.);  
dissipate thou the darkness; mayest thou speak forth what is agreeable;  
made of forest tree, uplifted, do not injure; do not crush to pieces  
⌊*vi-śṛ*⌋ the god-loving rice-grain.

### Notes
*Jihiṅsīr* in **c** is a misprint fox *jíhiṅsīr*, which all the ⌊i.e.  
W's⌋ mss. read. ⌊So read 9 of SPP's authorities: and 4 have *jáhiṅsīs;*  
but SPP. prints *jihiṅsīs*, accentless, with 3 of his mss. Perhaps the  
accent is to be regarded as antithetical.⌋ A part of our mss.  
(O.T.K.D.R.p.m.) read *śarīs* in **d**; Ppp. has *śarāis* ⌊see the  
references under vi. 32. 2⌋. The verse (with xi. 1. 9 **b**) accompanies  
in Kāuś. 61. 22 the pounding with the pestle.

We have subdued that sinful-hearted Grahi. Thou shalt speak sweetly having chased the darkness. Let not the wooden gear made ready fail us, nor harm the grain of rice that pays due worship.
