### Translation
44. To the Ādityas, the An̄girases, I announce this honey mingled with  
ghee; with cleansed hands, not smiting down \[anything of\] the  
Brahman's, go ye (du.), O well-doers, unto this heavenly world  
(*svargá*).

### Notes
The description by the Anukr. is quite wrong. The use by Kāuś. 62. 18  
was noted above, under vs. 41 . ⌊For the use of the genitive, W. has  
noted a reference to Delbrück's *Altindische Syntax*, p. 161.⌋

This meath do I announce, mingled with butter, to the Angi- rases and the Adityas. With pure hands ne'er laid roughly on a Brahman go, pious. couple, to the world of Svarga.
