### Translation
21. Manifoldly separate \[are\] the forms of cattle; thou becomest  
one-formed together with success; that red skin—that thrust thou  
\[away\]; the pressing-stone shall cleanse like a fuller (? *malagá*)  
the garments.

### Notes
Or **b** may be 'thou comest into being one-formed with success.'  
*Malagá* occurs nowhere else; its use with *iva* makes it impossible to  
tell whether the *pada*-text would divide *mala॰gaḥ*. Ppp. reads  
*bhavati* in **b** and *malagāi ’va* in **d**. ⌊Again, as in vss. 13 and  
26, it reads *śundhāti* for *śumbhāti*: cf. note to vi. 115. 3.⌋ The  
quotation in Kāuś. 61. 26 casts no light on the meaning. Our text ought  
to read *sámṛddhyā* at end of **b**. The verse is very ill named  
*jagatī* by the Anukr.; the treatment of *iva* in **d** as only one  
syllable makes a regular *triṣṭubh* of it.

Manifold, various are the shapes of victims. Thou growest uni- form by great abundance. Push thou away this skin of ruddy colour: the stone will cleanse as one who cleanses raiment.
