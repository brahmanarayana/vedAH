### Translation
3. Together in this world, together on the \[road\] the gods travel,  
together also unite ye (du.) in the realms of Yama; purified by  
purifiers, call ye to yourselves whatever seed (*rétas*) came into being  
from you.

### Notes
All the mss. agree in the unaccented *asmin* in **a**. The verse appears  
to be quoted (as 'third verse') in Kāuś. 60. 33, to accompany a calling  
upon their offspring (*apatya*).
