### Translation
4. Enter together, ye sons, into the waters, coming together, ye rich in  
life, unto this living one (m.); of them (f.) share ye the one which  
(m.) they call immortal, the rice-dish which your (du.) generatrix  
cooks.

### Notes
The meaning and connection are very obscure. 'Of them' seems to refer to  
the waters (f.). Ppp. removes one difficulty by reading *vas* instead of  
*vām* in **d**; it has in **b** ⌊*-dhanyāt*⌋ *sametā* ⌊cf. vs. 25⌋. In  
Kāuś. 60. 35 the verse is used when the pair lie down together,  
accompanied by their offspring, after a vessel of water has been set on  
the hide.
