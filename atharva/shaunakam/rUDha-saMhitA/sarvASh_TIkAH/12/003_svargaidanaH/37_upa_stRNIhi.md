### Translation
37. Strew thou on, spread forward, smear over with ghee this vessel; as  
a lowing cow (*usrā́*) \[toward\] a young \[calf\] desiring the teat, do  
ye, O gods, utter the sound *hing* toward this one.

### Notes
'Strew on': i.e., specifically, make an *upastaraṇa* or covering of  
butter. In Ppp. the second half-verse is wholly corrupt The verse is  
quoted in Kāuś. 61. 45, as accompanying the operation described, and the  
next verse is added in 61. 46 when the operation is completed.

Pour out the covering butter, spread it eastward: sprinkle this vessel over with the fatness. Greet this, ye Deities, with gentle murmur, as lowing cows wel- come their tender suckling.
