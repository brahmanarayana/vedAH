### Translation
33. O forest tree, sit on the strewn *barhís*, being commensurate with  
the Agni-praises (*agniṣṭomá*), with the deities; like a form well made  
by an artisan (*tváṣṭṛ*) with a knife, so (*enā́*) let the eager ones be  
seen round about in the vessel (*pā́tra*).

### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Bp. and Bs.s.m. read *svádhiyā* at end of **c**. The anomalous hiatus  
*enā́* (p. *enā́*) *ehā́ḥ* is noted in Prāt. iii. 34. Ppp. reads  
*svadhityāināhyāṣ pari pātre dadṛśyām*, which is welcome as ridding us  
of the wholly unsupported form *dadṛśrām;* ⌊cf. *Gram.* §813⌋. In Kāuś.  
61. 43, the verse accompanies the setting of a vessel (*pātrī*) upon the  
*barhis;* in Vāit. 10. 7, the laying of the sacrificial post upon the  
same (the editor of Kāuś. regards it as quoted also in 15. 11, but the  
verse there intended must be rather vi. 125. 1).

On the strewn grass. Vanaspati, be seated; commensurate with Gods and Agnishtomas. Let thy fair form, wrought as by Tvashtar's hatchet, mark these that yearn for thee within the vessel.
