### Translation
9. This western of the quarters verily is a thing to be preferred, in  
which Soma is over-ruler and favorer; to it resort (*śri*) ye (du.);  
attach yourselves to the well-doers; then, O paired ones, shall ye come  
into being from what is cooked.

### Notes
The last pāda is identical with 2 **d** above. But Ppp. reads instead  
*adhā pakvena saha saṁ bhavema*, which is nearly identical with vi. 119.  
2 **d** and the concluding pāda of SS-60 below. The Anukr. takes no  
notice of the deficiency of the first pāda.

Best of the regions is indeed this western wherein the King and gracious Lord is Soma. Thither resort for rest, follow the pious. Then gain the laden chargers, O ye couple.
