### Translation
45. I have obtained this highest division of it, from which world the  
most exalted one obtained \[it\] completely; pour thou on the butter  
(*sarpís*); anoint with ghee; this is the portion of our An̄giras here.

### Notes
Ppp. has in **a** a different order of words: *idaṁ kāṇḍam uttamaṁ  
prāpam asya*. The verse (with xi. 1. 31: the first half of each) is  
quoted in Kāuś. 62. 15, and again (the second half of each) in 62. 17,  
in connection with anointing the vessel with butter.

Of this have I obtained the noblest portion from that same world whence Parmeshthin gained it. Pour forth, besprinkle butter rich in fatness: the share of Angiras is here before us.
