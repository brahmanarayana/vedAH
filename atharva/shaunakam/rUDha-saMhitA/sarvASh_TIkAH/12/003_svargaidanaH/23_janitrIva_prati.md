### Translation
23. Mayest thou welcome as a mother a son; I unite (*sam-dhā*) thee that  
art earth with the earth; a kettle, a vessel, do not stagger upon the  
sacrificial hearth, overhung by the implements of offering \[and\] by  
sacrificial butter.

### Notes
The first pāda is apparently addressed to the earth, differently from  
the others. Ppp. puts the verse before our vs. 22, and reads in **c**  
*kumbhīr vedyāṁ saṁ carantāṁ*. One or two of our mss. (Bs.O.) read *uṣā́*  
in **c**.

Thou for thy son shalt yearn as yearns a mother. I lay thee down and with the earth unite thee. Conjoined with sacrificial gear and butter may pot and jar stand firmly on the altar.
