### Translation
14. Let this pressing-stone, broad-based, vigor-bestowing, purified by  
purifiers, smite away the demon; mount thou the hide; yield great  
protection; let not the husband-and-wife fall into evil proceeding from  
sons (*pāútra*).

### Notes
Ppp. has at the end *gāthām*, with which, of course, *dampatī* would  
have to be understood as vocative, unaccented. Expressions like that in  
**d** are found in several of the Sūtras: in AGS. i. 13. 7, *mā ’ham  
pāutram aghaṁ ni yām* (should be gām, probably); in PGS. i. 5. 11,  
*yathe ’yaṁ strī pāutram aghaṁ na rodāt;* and the same in HGS. i. 19. 7,  
with *pāutram ānandam* as antithesis to it. The verse is quoted in Kāuś.  
61. 18 (in connection with xi. 1. 9), to accompany the setting of  
mortar, pestle, and winnowing basket, after sprinkling, upon the hide.
