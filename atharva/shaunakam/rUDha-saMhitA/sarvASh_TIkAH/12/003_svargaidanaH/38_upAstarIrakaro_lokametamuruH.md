### Translation
38. Thou hast strewn on, hast made that world; let the broad unequalled  
heavenly world (*svargá*) spread itself out; to it shall resort (*śri*)  
the mighty eagle; the gods shall reach him forth to the deities.

### Notes
Ppp. begins with *apāskārāir*, and makes *śrayātāi* and *suparṇas*  
change places in **c**.

Thou hast poured oil and made the worlds: let heaven, unequal- led, be spread out in wide extension. Herein be cooked the buffalo, strong-pinioned: the Gods shall give the Deities this oblation.
