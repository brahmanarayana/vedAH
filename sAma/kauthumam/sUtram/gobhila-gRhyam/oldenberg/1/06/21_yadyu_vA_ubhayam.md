21. [^6]  If one wishes, however, to do himself the work both of the Hotṛ and of the Brahman, he should in the same way place on the Brahman's seat a parasol, or an outer garment, or a water-pot, or a bolster of Darbha grass, and should return in the same way (in which he has gone to the Brahman's seat), and then should perform the other (duties).


[^6]:  'In the same way' refers to the ceremonies stated in Sūtras p. 31 13 and 14. On the darbhacaṭu or, as some MSS. read, darbhavaṭu, see Bloomfield's note on the Gṛhya-saṃgraha, I, 88. 89. Knauer gives darbhavaṭuṃ without adding any various readings. Comp. Khādira-Gṛhya I, 1, 23.
