12. [^7]  Having circumambulated the fire so as to turn his right side towards it, having poured out the remains of water, and filled the vessel again, and put it (in its proper place), (he may do) whatever his business is.


[^7]:  The water is that mentioned chap. 1, 24. With regard to p. 21 yathārtham the commentary says, 'yathārthaṃ karmāpavargavihitaṃ Vāmadevyagānādikaṃ prātarāhutipaścādvihitaṃ brahmayajñaṃ vā kuryād iti vākyaśeṣaḥ.' Similarly in the note on II, 4, 11 it is said, 'yathārtham iti karmaṇaḥ parisamāptir ucyate;' II, 8, 17: 'yathārthaṃ tantrasamāpanaṃ kuryāt,' &c. In my translation I have adopted the opinion of Professor Weber (Indische Studien, V, 375), according to whom yathārtham simply means, '(he should behave) as required by circumstances;' '(he should do) what happens to be his business.'
