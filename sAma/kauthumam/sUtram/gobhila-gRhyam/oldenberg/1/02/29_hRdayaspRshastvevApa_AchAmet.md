29. [^8]  Let him, however, sip only water that reaches his heart.


[^8]:  In other texts (for instance, Manu II, 62; Vasiṣṭha III, 31 seqq.) it is stated that a Brāhmaṇa should sip water that reaches his heart, a Kṣatriya water reaching his throat, a Vaiśya water that wets his palate; a Śūdra should only touch water with his lips.
