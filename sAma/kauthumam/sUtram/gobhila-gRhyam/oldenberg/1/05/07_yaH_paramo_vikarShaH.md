7. [^5]  Full-moon is the greatest distance of sun and moon; new-moon is their nearest approach.


[^5]:  Here begins a new exposition of the question of full and new moon which stands independently by the side of the former sections, and which Gobhila has not taken much care to weld together with them. Comp. Sūtra to with Sūtras 2 and 3, and Sūtra 8 with Sūtra 4.
