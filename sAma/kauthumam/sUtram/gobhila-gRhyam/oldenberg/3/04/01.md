1. [^1] A student, after he has studied the Veda,


[^1]: 4, 1 seq. The description given in this chapter of the Samâvartana, or of the ceremony performed at the end of studentship, is opened with a few sentences referring to another section of the Grihya ritual, namely, to marriage. It seems to me that these first Sûtras of this chapter once formed, in a text from which Gobhila has taken them, the introduction to an exposition of the wedding ceremonies, and that Gobhila was induced to transfer them to the description of the Samâvartana, by their opening words, 'A student, after he has studied the Veda, &c.' With Sûtras 1-3, comp. Khâdira-Grihya I, 3, 1.
