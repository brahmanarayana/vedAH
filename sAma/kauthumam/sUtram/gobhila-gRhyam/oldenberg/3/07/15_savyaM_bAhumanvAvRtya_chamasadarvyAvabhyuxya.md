15. [^4]  Turning round from right to left, he besprinkles the wooden cup and the Darvi spoon, warms them, and (repeats the offering of a Bali) in the same way towards the south, towards the west, and towards the north, as the Mantra (MB. II, I, 1. 2) runs, without turning away (between the single Bali-offerings).


[^4]:  Literally, 'turning round, following his left arm.' Comp. Śāṅkhāyana II, 3, 2. The Mantra runs thus, 'O king of Serpents, dwelling towards the south (the west, the north), this is thy Bali!'
