13. [^6]  One who desires to gain a hundred cart-loads (of gold), should keep the vow (of fasting) through one fortnight and should on the first day of a dark fortnight feed the Brāhmaṇas with boiled milk-rice prepared of one Kāṃsa of rice.


[^6]:  Comp. chap. 5, 24-27. One Kāṃsa is stated to be a measure equal to one Droṇa. The more usual spelling is kaṃsa, and this reading is found in the corresponding passage of the Khādira-Gṛhya (IV, 2, 1).
