13. Seizing, again with his left hand, a Darbha blade (anointed with collyrium; chap. 2, 30), he should put it down, from right to left, on the Piṇḍa in the eastern pit, pronouncing his father's name, 'N.N.! This collyrium is thine, and is that of those who follow thee here, and of those whom thou followest. To thee Svadhā!'
