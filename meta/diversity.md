Some people equate vaidika religion with indra-centrism and shrauta ritual.

Caution about such - sharauta rituals and Indra's hymns had a high place in early Aryan religion. Yet, they were not all. 

Other practices and theologies (including vigrahArAdhana, shaiva/ vAyavya etc. branches, atimArga ..) were followed in parallel by the very same people. These came to be recorded in later works. Also, vedas refer to non-vedic literature (AkhyAyika-s, purANa-s).

Even within veda-s one sees great diversity in terms of theology (fave/top-Gods) - it's not "vishvasmAd indra uttaraH" all the time. Same with ritual details, metaphysics etc.. Sometimes such contradictions are acknowledged (with vehemence too!)
