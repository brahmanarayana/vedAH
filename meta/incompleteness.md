Incompleteness is freely admitted

- Rather, the veda-s say  "अनन्ता वै वेदाः" (TB 3.10.11.4) . Eg. endlessness of the veda-s as seen from the story of bharadhvAja in the taittirIya brAhmaNa and elsewhere \[[here](http://advaita-l.advaita-vedanta.narkive.com/MYrtMSe6/anantaa-vai-vedaah#post3)\]
-  taittirIya saMhitA (7.3.1.4) states: parimitā vā ṛcaḥ, parimitāni sāmāni, parimitāni yajūṁṣy, athaitasyaivānto nāsti yad brahma

## Contrasts
Where do the Vedas say that the religion ends there and then? For Islam, you can make that claim because the Quran specifically says that Allah has completed Islam in 5:3 [^5-3]. There is no equivalent in the Vedas.

[^5-3]: "This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you and have approved for you Islam as religion. But whoever is forced by severe hunger with no inclination to sin - then indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful."
