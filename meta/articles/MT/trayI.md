rayividyA> tevijja should be correctly understood both in the pALi & early Skt contexts as the 3 types of mantra-s: R^ik-s, sAman-s, yajuSh-es. 

- The RV saMhitA is only 1st type;
- the SV saMhitA is 2nd; SV brAhmaNa-s have all 3 types; e.g., pa~nchaviMsha-brAhmaNa opens with the yajuSh-es of the taNDin-s.
- The YV saMhitA-s have both R^ik-s& yajuSh-es. The YV-s have parishiShTha-s with RV style R^ik collections for hautra roles.
- AV is a collection of RV-style R^ik-s; yajuSh-es & a special class of incantation most commonly of the bheShaja type. These types have clear Iranic cognates -- yasna haptangaiti is Iranic yajuSh. 

Thus, the 3 types of mantra-s -- the trayi -- likely had a deep presence in the Aryan tradition & was only partially aligned to the saMhitA collections.
