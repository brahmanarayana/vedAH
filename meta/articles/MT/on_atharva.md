The AV is internally mentioned several times in the yajuSh as atharvA~Ngirasa. Thus, the collection predates the tathAgata, even if you follow a white indological chronology. The tathAgata, as is typical of him, redefined what the trayi meant; hence, we cannot take his mention of the term as defining some kind of vaidika reality. As you know he also clashes with a skull-tapping AV v1, va~NgIsha.

## Bipartition

>  Atharvaveda seems to have been compiled in two parts: The atharvan collection & aṅgiras collection. ... 

We do tarpaNa in 2 parts even today 1 for the Atharvana sections and another for the A~Ngirasa sections; -> atharvaNAm a~NgirasAM pratIchI |  the combined collection was recognized in the TB -  just as it is internally recognized in the AV saMhitA-s before upaniShat-s.

The link between the bhR^igu-s & the a~Ngiras-es in establishing the fire ritual is an ancient one. They are named together & remembered as the preeminent ancestors of the v1s in the manistic incantations RV itself. 

- Various ancient bhR^igu-s like bhR^igu, aurva, apanvAna are remembered for their discovery of fire within water -- a memory of the old Indo-European homeland.
- Similarly, the a~Ngiras-es are remembered as first institute the fire ritual: vipram padam a~Ngiraso dadhAnA yaj~nasya dhAma prathamam mananta || 

These ancient a~Ngiras ritualist clans who founded the yaj~na were known by the mysterious terms navagva & dashagva which the great patriot Tilak interpreted as meaning those who performed 9 or 10 monthly annual sattra-s pausing for the great aindra rite in months before the mahAvrata. 

Likewise we can make the argument that the ancient bhR^igu ritualists were known as the atharvan-s. They were nearly figures of mythology even by the time of the extant RV & known even in Iranic tradition. 


It seems likely that in addition to the a~Ngiras dominated (3 great clans, gotama-s, bArhaspatya-s kANva-s, apart from several other early a~Ngiras vipra-s) RV collection, both bhR^igu-s & a~Ngiras-es had several other "special incantations". 

- One of these were shAntika & abhichArika purposes used either within or outside classic shrauta contexts. Hence the term ghora for the abhichArika a~Ngiras collection.
- The other special collection was foundations of H medicine. 

This is explicitly remembered even outside the AV tradition: The kauthuma-s say: 

> bheShajaM vAtharvaNAni, bheShajam eva tat karoti | 

### Unification
At some point the bhR^igu-s & some a~Ngiras consciously decided to unify their collection into a single one. Indeed, the existence of earlier separate precursor collections is indicated by:

1. a fragment of that corpus in the Kashmirian RV khila. 
2. Notices in sAmaveda brAhmaNa-s of the compositions of distinct compositions Atharvan-s which included bheShaja & other material. 
3. The mysterious teachings of the ancient atharvan kabandha which remanifest in shamanic possessions in multiple later vedic texts. 

By the time of the Yajurvedic brAhmaNa-s we hear of the unified corpus in unambiguous terms mirroring the self-referral in the AV gopatha brAhmana. Thus, we posit that the special bhR^igu-a~Ngiras collection was ancient but "stored" in the more archaic manner of the clan books. Episodically, parts of it were incorporated in the RV Khila & the emerging KYV & SV texts where needed.

However, the comprehensive collection was initiated after the KYV & SV saMhitA-s were compiled & this became the ur-AV saMhitA which evidently was a superset of what today is the vulgate \~ shaunakIya & paippalAda. After this joint compilation new compositions were added to it in a manner that perhaps involved a process similar to invoking the ancient kabandha AtharvaNa coming back to give new revelations. These new compositions can be identified by their conscious recognition of a unified AV collection. At least in Gujarat & possibly Kashmir down to the early medieval period, some version of the unified AV tradition was still practiced.
