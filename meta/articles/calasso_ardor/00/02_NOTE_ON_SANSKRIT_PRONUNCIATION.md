+++









The *a* is closed and is similar to the *u* in *but*; the vowels *ā*, *ī*, and *ū* are long: for example, *ī* is pronounced like *ee* in *feet*, not like the *i* in *fit*; *ṛ* is a vowel and is pronounced by resting it on a barely discernible *i* or *u.* The *e* is closed as in *better*; the *o* is closed as in *bother.*

The *g* is always hard: for example *gītā* is pronounced *geeta*; the *c* is always soft: for example, *cakra* is pronounced *chakra. S* is always like the *s* in *sound*; *ś* and *ṣ* are more or less like *sh* in *shun.* *Ṛṣi* is therefore pronounced *rishi.* The retroflexed *ṭ*, *ḍ*, and *ṇ* are pronounced by bending the tongue back to touch the palate, as in *utter*, *udder*, or *runner.* The aspirate occlusives *kh*,* gh*,* ch*,* jh*,* th*,* dh*,* th*,* ph*, and *bh* are single phonemes, and are pronounced with an aspiration after the consonant: for example, *ph* is pronounced as in *top hat*, not as in *telephone*, and *th* is pronounced as in *dirt heap*, not as in *think* or *father.*

*Ñ* is like the *n* in *country*; *h* is a sounded aspiration as in *inherent.*

The accent falls on the last long vowel \(for example: *Prajāpati* is pronounced *Prajápati*\). The vowels *e* and *o* are also long. Furthermore, all vowels are long when positioned before consonant groups. If there are no long vowels, the accent is placed on the third or fourth to last syllable \(if this is a root syllable\). For example: *Gáruda*, *Gótama*, *śrámaṇa.*

A few words that are typically Vedic are stressed with a musical tone called *udātta*, which required the pitch of the voice to be raised, but this has disappeared in Classical Sanskrit.
