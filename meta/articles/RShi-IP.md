Some are upset with the phrase, “your knowledge systems” below. Is it really so offensive? The 100s of references to Āṅgirasas, Bhāradvājas, Gotamās, Kāṇvas, Bhṛgavas, Jamadagnis, Vāsiṣṭhas, Viśvāmitras/Kuśikas, Agastis, Ātreyas, Kaśyapas throughout the Veda are not in vain.

All of the aforementioned Ṛṣi groups are survived by descendants till today who are still learning this body of scripture. Anyone can read the Veda, sure. But you can’t help but notice right away (if you are not reading it mindlessly) that the Veda is the ancestral heritage of a group that still survives by Īśvara’s Will & grace, despite whatever hate you may throw at it.

In one of the greatest Vedic rituals, the Agnicayana, almost every brick laid down to build the bird-shaped altar is mantrically asked to be seated like Aṅgiras, in memory of the resolute discipline, dedication & devotion of the Aṅgirasas to the sacred fire & ritual.

Even if those grand rituals can’t be done anymore, for an Āṅgirasa who reads the relevant mantras & Brāhmaṇas (prosaic parts of the Veda that explains mantras) —be it a Bhāradvāja, Gotama, Kāṇva, etc—his heart wells up with devotion & gratitude to his Ṛṣi ancestors. When the normal Agnicayana is given variants in the Veda, who discovers these variants? In one case, it’s a Bharadvāja. In another case, it’s a Gotama.

The Vāsiṣṭhas repeat their name in every mantra of Ṛgveda Sam̐hitā (Śākalya Śākhā) 7.33 & in so many sūktas in the 7th maṇḍala, the Ṛṣis refer to their fathers with devotion & affection, hoping that they too will see great mantras like their pious forebears.

The Taittirīya Sam̐hitā of Kṛṣṇa-Yajurveda refers to the names of the five great Ṛṣis to be uttered by one of the Jamadagni lineage. Those same five names are recited by Śrīvatsa Gotrīs as part of their daily prayers even today.

Centuries after the Ṛgveda had been canonized, a descendant of Vasiṣṭha refuses to comment on Ṛgveda Sam̐hitā (Śākalya Śākhā) 3.53, conceived by Viśvāmitra, saying that it causes harm to Vāsiṣṭhas. Even the bitter parts of the Veda has the Ṛṣi-stamp all over it.

And even after a 1000 years or later, the descendants of the concerned Ṛṣi lines feel so much for this or that hymn. They are moved in a way that others simply cannot. The Ṛṣis had a special purpose & they hoped that their descendants will continue to fulfill this purpose & be the beacons they are meant to be. It is because of this, the Javanese, after installing an icon of Agastya, prayed that Agastya’s descendants should ever be happy.

There is an undeniable, special connection between the Veda, the Ṛṣis & their descendants. That the Veda brings good to all & contains the most sacred meanings do not & will not render this connection meaningless. In fact, an integral part of this good to brought by the Veda is this connection. And genuine Brāhmaṇas will always be aware of this connection with the Ṛṣis & the responsibility it brings & will speak their mind. You are free to ignore them but can’t ask them to shut up about their own ancestral heritage.

The Veda is for the good of all. I believe this whole-heartedly like any good Brāhmaṇa ought to. Having said that, it IS the blood, sweat, tears & quite literally spiritual toil (Tapas) of the Āṅgirasas, Bhṛgus, Vasiṣṭhas, Viśvāmitras, Ātreyas, Kaśyapas & Agastīs. Glory to the Ṛṣi forefathers & may we adore them in our hearts & live lives pleasing to them.
