## 1. The Sacrifice as a Gift 

As we have seen, the Vedic pantheon is essentially a body of great and powerful gods before whom the worshipper realizes to the full his comparative weakness and inability to exist satisfactorily without their constant aid. By the most simple logic he applies to the powers divine the same principle which he applies to other more powerful men, or which are applied to him by his inferiors. He seeks to propitiate them by the process of giving gifts.1 Doubt- less, beside this view of the relation of man to the gods, there existed the belief that he could do much for himself by the power of the magic art, which we need not doubt flourished as much then as in later India, and against demons of all kinds magic is freely employed, but the essential distinction of magic and religion is plainly to be seen in the whole of the Vedic religion. Often too in place of using magic, or still oftener in supplement of magic, the aid of the gods is employed in the battle with the demons. In the case of one of the higher gods alone is there any trace of other than a relation of friendship: the aim of the worshipper is to satiate Rudra and to avert his dangerous presence: this fact, which expresses itself in the ritual in many ways, makes a certain degree of difference between the case of Rudra and the other gods, though occasionally some of these, such as Varuņa, show slight traces of a similar conception of their nature to that of Rudra. 

The dead stand in a peculiar relation to man, since they deserve from him consideration and honour, but mingled with that conception is the fear of the quick for the dead. It is often asserted 2 that the mode of honouring the gods is a direct imitation of the mode of providing for the dead, but the assertion admits of no proof, and must stand or fall with the effort to demonstrate a priori that all sacrifice or worship of gods is secondary, and dependent on the cult of the dead. In the Vedic, as in the Greek ritual, the nature of the cult of the gods and that of the dead is markedly and in important measure different, a fact which tells, as much as any such argument can tell, against the original identity of the two cults. This fact renders it at once desirable and

convenient to treat of the cult of the dead together with Vedic eschatological conceptions in the next part of this work. 

In the Rigveda and in the later period alike the cult of the gods is marked by the absence of any temple or house of the god, even of the simplest kind. The nearest approach to such a conception is perhaps the fires of the Sabha and the Avasatha which in the Sutras are mentioned as to be kept up by kings; but in this we have merely an occasional use, and the Vedic ritual has nothing similar to the tending of a perpetual fire by Vestal Virgins in the house of the king as at Rome. There is no public cult, merely the carrying out of offerings for princes and other men wealthy enough to employ professional priests, and the performance of a much simpler cult by the householder himself. The essential form of the sacrifice is one which can be carried out under these circumstances, and it reduces itself to the invitation the god to come to the place of offering, and to partake of the food and drin. provided for him. The gifts of costly jewels or garments and of chariots or weapons or other accoutrements, are wanting in the ritual, partly no doubt from the absence of any place in which such jewels and other gifts might be kept, but more perhaps from the fact that the priests considered it in their own interest to secure that these things should be disposed of most wisely by bestowal upon them. In so highly developed a priestly atmosphere as that of the ritual it is at least reasonable to believe that gifts, which an earlier piety might have conveyed by fire to heaven, were converted to their own use by the vicegerents of the god on earth, who even in the Brāhmaṇas claim the title of god for them- selves, while in the classical literature it is assumed by the king. 

It was of course essential that the god invited should be received in a due place, and that any honours which were possible should be paid to him. Hence the hymns of praise, the sound of music, and the dance: even perhaps the theosophical riddles with which at the great horse sacrifice the priests delighted one another, and it may well be the god, since gods were built by priests in their own image. But in addition to these features there was much more in the Vedic sacrifice, mimic combats, ribaldry, chariot racing, archery, dicing, and much else, which cannot be deemed save in quite a secondary way to have been thought to be part of the entertainment provided for the god. In the vast majority of these cases the nature of the ritual can be solved at once by the application of the concept sympathetic magic, and this is one of the most obvious and undeniable facts in the whole of the 

Above, Part II, Chap. 10, § 1. This fact very markedly distinguishes 

Vedic from Babylonian religion; the lack of temples assimilates it to Iranian religion, which, however, seems to have known fire altars of a somewhat per- manent character; cf. Jackson, GIP. ii. 688, 701; Moulton, Early Zoroas- trianism, pp. 52, 58. For the lack of 

temples, as opposed to sacred groves, in Germany, see Tacitus, Germ. 9; Helm, Altgerm. Rel. i. 285, 286 f.

Vedic sacrifice: it is from beginning to end full of magic elements,1 which can as a rule be perfectly easily disentangled from the rest of the rite. In some cases it is impossible not to feel that the rite is merely magic dressed up with sacrifice, but in the majority of rites no such view is possible, and in many the magic element is wholly secondary. 

4 

The nature of the ordinary offering to the god is expressly stated to be an offering made to the god for the purpose of attracting his attention and good- will, so that, delighted himself, the god may reward in the appropriate way his worshipper. This is essentially the standpoint of the Rigveda where the sacrificer is promised wealth both temporal and in the world to come in return for his sacrifice, and his gifts to the priest, and where the gods are invoked to delight themselves with the offering and to reward their votaries.* The Brah- manas bluntly state the doctrine of do ut des in so many words,3 and Suśravas, we are told, was approached by Indra, who told him he was hungry and gladly took from him the cakes of the offering. But the gods in the Rigveda are not less frank in their expression of feeling: they can sympathize with the poor man who can offer but little, but they are bitterly indignant with the rich man who gives nothing. The whole formula is excellently expressed in the Sūktavāka formula uttered near the end of the sacrifice, where it is said," 'The god hath accepted the offering; he hath become strengthened; he hath won greater might,' to which the sacrificer for whom the rite is performed replies, May I prosper in accordance with the prospering of the god.' It is, however, needless to multiply examples: this theory of the sacrifice and its result as an exchange of gifts, of strength for strength, is the fundamental fact of the whole Vedic religion. 

5 

Beside this form of offering in hope of favours to come very small traces can be found of the offering which expresses grateful thanks for favours paid. The two ideas are clearly closely connected and to a generous people the existence of the one might seem to bring with it essentially the existence of the other. But it is clear that as in Roman religion the traces of the thank- offering are scanty and, though the idea is known, it has a feeble existence. A Sūtra prescribes such an offering for the case in which a man after falling ill recovers his health: the case is interesting for its simplicity: if a man falls ill after establishing the three offering fires, he should go away from his place of abode: the fires love the village and in their desire to return thither may

heal him, in which case he should perform a Soma or an animal sacrifice. The offering of firstfruits, however, is mainly if not entirely an offering to secure the safe eating of the new products, an idea which is of world-wide extension. If a man has a son born to him 3 or attains a thousand cattle he sacrifices, but merely to secure the health of one or the other; if he makes a vow and keeps it on the fulfilment of the occasion, as for instance if he says to a god, 'Slay him and I will offer to thee,' the keeping of the promise, which was not always done, is not a thank-offering. If the dead have a feast made for them when there is a birth in the family or a wedding," it is not according to the texts for thanks at their bringing about the good fortune: it may rather be that they are expected to share in the common joy, or that it is hoped to avert their envy of the good fortune of the house. The horse sacrifice is indeed offered after the attainment of the position of a great prince, but the ritual shows that it concludes with a prayer for the welfare of the king and his people and the birth of a prince: it is in effect an offering to secure the maintenance of the success arrived at, a fact hinted clearly by the assertion of the Brāhmaṇas that it is fatal to a weak king to make such an offering. 

## 2. The Sacrifice as a Spell 

In the theosophy of the Brahmaņas it is an accepted fact that the sacrifice has a magic power of its own, and that it brings about the effects at which it aims with absolute independence: the old idea of the working upon the good will of a deity has disappeared, and in the philosophy of the Pūrva Mīmānsä,o which is the logical outcome of the Brāhmaṇas, the idea of god is effectively disposed of. But the theosophy of the Brahmaņas is of no value as religion, and the question arises whether the Rigveda shows any real trace of the belief in the magic efficacy of the sacrifice. Much of the evidence which has been adduced by both Bergaigne and Geldner 10 for the view that the priests claim to control the gods, to capture them in the net of the sacrifice, and make them do their bidding, is clearly without weight: the simple imagery of the poets cannot be pressed to mean more than it says. The later literature, which regards the priest as powerful to control the gods, openly says so,11 and provides the believer with magic devices in order to bind hard the Adityas until they

yield what is desired,1 and Kutsa is said to tie Indra up in disgraceful fashion,2 but nothing of that gross kind can certainly be found in the Rigveda. The most that can be adduced are a passage where Indra is spoken of as pursued by the priest with milk as hunters the wild beast, a prayer that the mortal may be lord over Agni in his house,a and an assertion that honour, Namas, is above the gods themselves, nothing more than occasional expressions of exaltation in the priestly power. Moreover, when the Vasiṣṭhas pride themselves on drawing Indra away from Paśadyumna, they evidently assume that the god was free to choose, and preferred them to their rival. But, while the idea of the power of the sacrifice over the gods is merely commencing to manifest itself, there is clear evidence that the belief in the greatness of the sacrifice was in process of steady development. It is seen in such declarations as that the sun was born through the result of the sacrifice of Atharvan," and from the fact that the offerings of the Añgirases won the treasures of the Panis is deduced the doctrine that great might is that of the Soma-presser. The greatness of the sacrifice is also brought out by the doctrine of the first sacri- fice of the gods in which they offered up the giant Purușa: from this sacrifice were born the hymn and the metre of the sacrifice: the idea of the production of sacrifice by sacrifice is precisely in the strain of shallow mysti- cism which is characteristic of the Vedic conceptions. That the human offering could produce results by itself is here and there, it would seem, recognized in the Rigveda, where the morning Agnihotra seems to have power to aid the sun to rise,1o and more distinctly in a late hymn the bringing down of rain is treated as if it were the direct work of the Purohita Devāpi." 

10 

It would, however, be a complete error to assume that the magic side of the sacrifice is the primitive one, and that the whole sacrifice is really a magic performance. The sacrifice might well have in it ab initio elements of magic, and certainly the Vedic sacrifices known to us have many, but the Brāhmaṇas enable us to see clearly that the priests were determined to find in them throughout a magical effect. To every point some special working is attri- buted, and it becomes possible to secure ruin or prosperity for the sacrificer by the mere manipulation of some detail of no importance. All this is clearly the work of a later constructive religious outlook, and what is most noteworthy is not that, here and there, the same spirit is to be found in the Rigveda, but that it should play so small a part in that collection. Nor can there be any doubt that, in the course of the fixing of the ritual, many details must have

been added or altered, simply for the purpose of introducing elements of magic potency: it is impossible not to see such influences effective in the drawing up of many of the details of the horse sacrifice, which is reduced by the Vedic texts to a performance, which cannot possibly have ever been realized in practice, and in which the magic purpose of much of the machinery is plain and undeniable.2 

A further question arises whether we can trace behind the Vedic sacrifice as a gift offering the older view that it is really not a gift at all, but an effort to secure the propagation of the life of the herds and of the world of vegetation, by the periodic slaying from time to time of the spirit of vegetation, or in the case of animals of a representative of the species, in order to secure the fresh- ness of the life of the vegetation and of the beasts of the earth. In this view, which is that of Sir J. Frazer, the sacrifice in the long run is reduced purely and simply to a piece of magic: it represents a period before man ceases to believe himself lord of nature, and master of all that he desires, and, recog- nizing the futility of his high belief in humanity, turns to the conception of supernatural powers, whom he supplicates for the results, which he thought formerly to bring about by his own magic powers. The substantial element at the back of the theory is, of course, the considerable mass of facts adduced by Mannhardt, and before him by Grimm, which illustrate the widespread usage of the killing of the outworn corn spirit, perhaps with some idea of strengthen- ing it, though of late a very formidable opponent to that theory 4 has appeared in the shape of the view that the thing which is destroyed is not the corn spirit at all, but the witches and wizards whose attacks on the crops are perpetual, an idea which is richly proved for India by the figures of the Rakṣases and their constant conjunction with sorcery. There are, however, features of the later religion of India such as the legend of Kṛṣṇa and Kansa,3 which point to the old vegetation ritual in which the contest between the spirits of winter and summer is revealed, and this conception has certain affinities with the theory of the killing of the corn spirit when outworn. In the Vedic ritual, however, it is extremely difficult to find any case in which this theory can be applied with much plausibility. 

8 

One instance has been adduced by Hillebrandt which is of interest in itself. At the concluding bath of the horse sacrifice a sacrifice to Jumbaka is offered on the head of a man of repulsive appearance, who is driven into the

water, and the texts make it clear that Jumbaka is believed to be Varuņa and that the appearance of the man is intended to correspond with that of Varuna. Now the man who plays the part in this rite is said to be an Atreya, bought with a thousand cows, and it is further mentioned that the formulae used at the time of the oblation include' To death hail! To the slaying of an embryo hail!' and it is therefore suggested by Hillebrandt that we have here the trace of the slaying of a man, a view which was also taken by Weber, who thought that the man was drowned in the waters. Hillebrandt further con- nects the story with the legend of the proposed killing of Çunaḥśepa, who was bought in the same way from his father to be offered in the place of the son of the king Hariścandra who has offered to sacrifice his son to Varuņa, and he concludes that there was a practice at one time of slaying the old king and substituting another, the slaughter taking place at the end of the horse sacrifice. The theory is ingenious, but it is clearly without any contact with fact. The story of Çunahśepa is one which has no allusion anywhere to the practice of slaying the old king: it is the son whom the father offers to kill, and connexion with the killing of the old king could only be arrived at by supposing that, in view of the existence of the custom in question, the old king took the precaution of seeing that no son to supersede him was forth- coming, which is really absurd. The case of the offering to Jumbaka is also clearly misunderstood: there is preserved for us in a Sūtra an invaluable hint of the meaning in the statement that the guilt of the village outcasts is thus removed: the ceremony belongs to the numerous and important class of services for the expulsion of evil, and the ceremonial bath acts as a purifica- tory element rather than, as suggested, as a piece of vegetation magic. The hideous appearance of the man is explained by the same fact, for the Pharmakoi in the analogous rite in Greece, in whom have been seen by an amazing piece of ingenuity the prototypes of Adam and Eve, are also hideous, and the assumption that we have in the features of the man the imitation of the features of Varuna is an absurd idea, well worthy of the Brahmaņas. The payment is only natural: the priests were always well aware of the value of their services, and honesty must admit that they were fully entitled to expect high payment for the disagreeable duty of taking on themselves the burden of the sins of the village outcasts. The idea that the Atreya priest was really once the old king thus vanishes into the limbo of practical impossibilities. 

5 

It is, however, more important to consider whether such an idea can be seen in the horse sacrifice itself, not in the bath ceremony which is a mere appendix. The essence of the horse sacrifice is the slaying of the steed, which is treated with great honour, gaily caparisoned, and is invited to eat the remains of the night oblations of grain which, if refused by the steed, are thrown into water, 1 See Keith, JRAS. 1908, pp. 845–7. * AB. vii. 13 ff.; ÇÇS. xv. 17 ff.

outcasts by bathing in this bath are purified.

doubtless because their sanctity is too great to permit of their consumption by any one else. Nor is it possible to doubt that in the rite the horse is really the horse of the sun; the steed Dadhikrävan, whom we have seen to be the steed of the sun, is said to be the sacrificial horse. It may, therefore, be sug- gested that by the slaying of the horse, which is solemnly performed, it was originally intended to perpetuate the race of horses, and that later on, when the horse was regarded as representing the sun, the rite became a sun spell. It is right to state the possibility of such a development: the probability is obviously practically negligible. The same remark applies to the other cases of the ritual: if for instance the goat is offered to Puṣan as it often is, then, as we must admit that Puṣan seems to have been once conceived as in goat form, it is possible that the original offering was simply that of a goat, in order to propagate the race of goats, or at a later period of a goat as the representative of the corn spirit; but in this case also we would have to admit that the whole theory had been entirely forgotten in Vedic times, where the offering was in no sense periodical, and when the goat form of Pûṣan was far from being vividly present to the worshippers, while the gift theory of sacrifice remains for this case the most simple and obvious explanation possible. The horse sacrifice presents more difficulties, but none that are helped by the theory of the corn spirit.1 

§3. The Removal of Sin by Sacrifice and Magic 

In the ritual of the sin offering the mixture of magic and sacrifice presents itself in the clearest way. The sin offering is only in essence a special form of the gift sacrifice: the gift is offered to avert the wrath of the god: it seeks to produce in him not the positive action of furthering the welfare of the suppliant as is normally the case, but the negative attitude of sparing the guilty man. In its rudest form the chain of ideas must be assumed to be that the food and drink will delight the god, and thus he will forget his anger : such a view is based on one of the most primitive instincts of mankind: the hungry man is unlikely to forgo his wrath, while the soothing effects of meat and drink on humanity, however just its anger, and moral its indignation, are notorious. Nor is there any doubt that simple sacrifices to avert the anger of the god, usually Varuna, were common: it is legitimate to suppose that the hymns of deprecation 2 of the anger of Varuna and of expressions of hope to be reconciled with him, which are found in the Rigveda, were accompanied by sacrifice: it would be very remarkable if this were not the case, but apart from that point the ritual is well aware of such offerings. Thus for the breach of an oath an offering is ordered to Agni Vaiśvānara, who may safely be assumed to have been the god by whom in the special instance the oath was sworn, and who therefore must be appeased if he is not to execute, vengeance for the breach of faith.

Chap. 18] The Removal of Sin by Sacrifice and Magic 

265 

On the other hand, the element of magic enters very largely into the ceremony of the Varunapraghasas,1 the second of the four-month offerings. On the first day of the offering barley is roasted on the Dakṣiņa fire, the one used for all ritual acts of an uncanny description: then a number of dishes of a porridge made from the barley are prepared, one for each member of the family with one over, apparently for the members yet unborn. The wife of the sacrificer is then asked by the priest what lovers she has; she must name them, or at least indicate the number by holding up as many stalks of grass as she has lovers, and by this action she purifies herself from her sins in this regard otherwise, if she does not tell the truth, it will go badly for her con- nexions. She is then taken to the southern fire, in which she offers the plates with the words, * Whatever sin we have committed in the village, in the forest, among men and in ourselves, that by sacrifice we remove here,' and further on an offering is made to Varuņa, who is asked to spare the lives of his sup- pliants, and not to be wroth. The nature of the sacrifice is evidently in the main magical: the offering to Varuņa and the consciousness of sin are there, but it may be legitimately be said that the essential part of the rite is the expulsion of sins by means of the magic rite, though due note must be taken that, as preserved to us, the other ethical element comes in. The burning of the dishes is of course essential, as they are laden with the sin: it may be compared with the purification by water of the scapegoat in the horse sacrifice, to which reference has been made above. In the course of the Soma sacrifice the priests throw into the fire splinters of the wood of the sacrificial post, charging them with the removal of the sin wrought by the gods, the Fathers, man, and themselves. In the Sautrāmaņi offering a vessel filled with a special preparation is allowed to float away with the sins of those concerned. In the case in which a younger brother commits the crime of marrying before the elder, the sins of both in the form of fetters are thrown into the foam of the water, and thus allowed to vanish. The washing of the mouth removes the sin of untruth for three years —the mystic three or the unit one ® are most common in these statements of time-and the evil brought by an ill-omened bird can be washed away and removed by the carrying round of fire." In the same way are used plants, the Apämärga plant seems to owe its very name to its uses in such rites, amulets, and spells.10 On the other hand, the intervention of the gods is constantly mentioned: Agni Vaiśvānara, Agni Garhapatya, Savitṛ, Püṣan, the Maruts, Viśvakarman, the All-gods are invoked to remove the evil. The evil in fact is treated precisely like a disease,

and is to be dealt with in just the same way. Moreover, as is natural, the con- cept of evil is of the widest possible kind: every sort of error in the sacrifice, every sort of out-of-the-way occurrence in the life of the home and the herds, such as the birth of twins, every sort of strange occurrence in ordinary nature, is made the cause for such an offering, and the Brāhmaṇas and still more the Sūtras pile up long lists of offerings under the rubric Prāyaścitta,1 a term which is not yet found in the Rigveda. The taste for such inventions is clearly one which grew with the development of the priestly system, and must from the constant number of such Prayaścittas, and the gifts to the priest which were enjoined as an essential part, have counted for much in the life of the priesthood. For religious purposes they are of little interest, since they consist in the main of offerings overlaid with magic practices of the most simple and obvious kind. 

There is another set of practices connected with the removal of sin which present difficulties, and which are only recorded at the very end of the Vedic period, but the antiquity of which can hardly be seriously doubted. The Brahman student is under a duty of chastity: if he fails in this duty he is required to make an offering of an ass to the goddess Nirṛti: his portion of the victim is cut from the penis: and thereafter he goes about clad in the skin of the victim and begging for alms, duly proclaiming his sin to those from whom he begs. The husband who sins against his wife wears also an ass's skin and begs, proclaiming that he has sinned against her. The murderer carries the skull of the dead man, drinks out of it, wears an ass's skin or the skin of a dog, which indicates him as a murderer to all and sundry, and lives on alms, declaring to those from whom he begs the crime which he has com- mitted. There are here obviously many and varied elements of belief: the element of confession is clear in all these cases: the wickedness is made less by being declared, a doctrine which is of course prominently exhibited in the case of the Varuṇapraghāsas, at a much earlier date than the customs reported in the Sutras. A second motive may be the warning of others of the nature of the being with whom they deal; to a primitive people, believing in the physical transfer of evil, such a warning was a real necessity: this is parallel with the fact that the guilty generally are often ordered to remove from contact with the living. The bearing about of the skull of the dead and drinking from it is attributed by Oldenberg as possibly due to the belief that demons drink from the skulls of the dead, an idea which might of course be traced back to the reflection in belief of an actual custom : as the custom and

the belief are reported to us both from the same late stage of the literature, there is no external evidence to aid in a decision. Oldenberg suggests also that it is the idea that the crime must be allowed to take the fullest control of the sinner, and in the observances in question expression is given to this rule. It is, however difficult to feel assured that this is a plausible explanation; it is required in reality only for the episode of the carrying of the skull, and this carrying seems in itself rather to be reminiscent of the carrying of such a skull, and the use of it for very different reasons, namely the keeping under one's own control of the spirit of the angry dead,1 modified no doubt in later belief often merely to an added insult to the memory and spirit of the dead. It is possible that in the rite which is handed down to us what was originally a habit of head-hunters had been reduced to a punishment of murderers. But beyond speculation we cannot, it is clear, go. 

The wearing of the skin of an ass or of a dog, which were both unclean animals *—that is to say, animals of a peculiar nature-cannot be regarded as explained by the theory of Oldenberg, even if it could be given credence to any extent. The case of the student is here the most interesting, as it involves a sacrifice, and has the most primitive appearance: the dog was clearly in some ways a peculiar beast: nothing but the utmost hunger would drive a man to eat a dog: it is therefore quite possible that the wearing of the skin has no reference to any sacrifice, and the wearing of the ass-skin by the murderer may easily be due to the fact that the practice was customary in other cases. In that of the Brahmacarin the most obvious and simple explana- tion of the rite is that the virility of the ass is its most marked feature, that the wearing of the skin and the eating of the special part assigned to the student were intended to replace the manhood expended improperly. The fact that the offering was made to Nirṛti then ceases to stand in special relation to the goddess, as connected with the ass : Nirṛti is the personification of dissolution: to her an offer might properly then be made in the circum- stances, and, as often, we find the offering intermingled with the magic rite, as in the case of the offering to Varuna at the Varunapraghāsas. The wearing of the skin might then easily degenerate into an intimation of the sinfulness of the wearer, as it certainly was recognized in this use in the 

The head-hunting and preservation of heads were characteristic of the Celts (MacCulloch, Rel. of Anc. Celts, pp. 240 ff.), Germans (Müllenhoff, Deutsche Alt., iv. 145), and other Aryans (Brunn- hofer, Arische Urzeit, pp. 322–4, 372). ' PB. xxi. 3. 5; ApDS. i. 8. 10. 17. The totemistic theory of tabooed animals may be applied both to the dog (as in the case of the dogs of Aktsion) and the ass (Marsyas as an ass) as has been done for Greece by Reinach, Cultes, Mythes et Religions, iii. 87; iv. 40–4.

Sutras, but that this idea is primitive is absurd. The case of the man who has abandoned his wife is probably the same: the magic power of the skin is to give him virility, and induce him to perform his duty which he has abandoned : it must be remembered that, as with most primitive peoples, and in the Roman Catholic faith of the present day, cohabitation with his wife is a man's bounden duty, an idea reflected in various Indian stories.

The only other explanation of the rite which may at first sight seem plausible is the idea that the ass is the representative of the man, in that the man instead of sacrificing himself to the angry deity offers a substitute. We might, if we accepted this view, rank with this case the instances of the representation of the members of the family by the dishes in the Varuna- praghasas, the offering of hair to the dead, and the assertion of the Brah- maņas that the victim which is offered to Agni and Soma in the course of the Soma sacrifice is really offered as a ransom for oneself. This theory, however, will not stand any close examination. The explanation of the hair offering is open to the gravest objection: it seems rather a mere mode of bringing the living into the closest possible connexion with the dead, through the medium of part of himself, without any idea that he either should or would give himself as an offering. The case of the dishes is obviously a case of simple material transfer without any idea of offering of the members of the family, and the victim for Agni and Soma is only said to be a substitute in explanatory and speculative passages, and even there the view is evidently not always accepted its true nature will be explained later. The explanation in the case of the ass sacrifice is also most improbable: it treats the sin which is evidently by no means a very serious one-the chastity of the Brahmans was evidently of a somewhat mild order of virtue-as if it were a deadly sin, a conception not at all a favourite one with the priests. 

## 4. Communion and Sacrament in the Sacrifice 

While in the view of Sir J. Frazer the essence of early sacrifice is the magic art of perpetuating the life of the herds and of vegetation and even of man, the gift theory of sacrifice has also been declared to be merely derivative, on the ground that it is really a faded remnant of the sacrifice in which the worshippers eat together of the flesh and blood of the deity, thus renewing and strengthening the bonds between themselves on the one hand and the god on the other. That such a form of sacrifice existed is beyond all doubt attested for the Semites, but not for the Babylonians, and there are traces of it in Greek

and in other religions. It is not necessary to insist, as does S. Reinach, that the origin of such an offering is totemistic: it is perfectly possible without any such system at the base to explain it : O. Gruppe 2 treats this form of sacrifice as the oldest and most primitive of all, the effort to obtain directly and most effectively a share in the divine power felt in the world. But it is one thing to believe in the existence of the sacrifice in this form, and to prove that it is the only type of sacrifice, and unless this can be done the gift form of sacrifice must continue to stand as an independent form. The objection that the gift theory must be later than the communion and sacrament form of sacrifice, 'because the conception of private property is necessary for the making of gifts, is not worth the consideration which has been sometimes shown to it. It is obvious that, apart from all other considerations, it has from the first been possible to offer to a god material things without any precise conception of ownership having been attained. 

Now in the conception of the sacramental communion there are clearly present two elements which need not necessarily be combined. It is possible for the communion to appear by itself alone: the worshippers are imagined to eat and with them the deity eats, so that the deity and his worshippers have thus a common bond in the food which they consume: of this the Homeric sacrifice3 clearly presents us with a good example, while another is given by the Latin festival on the Alban Mount. In the second place, however, there may be more than this: the victim may be in some way divine: the most developed idea will be found when the victim is imagined as actually being an embodiment of the god for the time being, but it may be that the victim is merely more or less affected by the divine spirit from the fact that the god comes to the place of offering, and therefore that the divine spirit affects the victim and the place of offering." Of the latter idea there is a clear hint in the Homeric ritual of sacrifice of an animal victim: the barley seems to have been laid on the altar, and then brought into contact with the victim to convey to the victim the divine spirit present in the altar, and this idea is confirmed by later evidence, such as the sacrifice at Athens known as the Bouphonia," and 

1 Farnell, Greece and Babylon, pp. 241 ff. A good example of the common meal as a means of producing harmony is given in Kauś. xii. 8, 9. The same Sütra (xiii. 6) prescribes a magic rite, in which portions of the members of some animals, lion, tiger, he-goat, ram, bull, a warrior and a Brahman student are to be eaten, to attain the possession of certain qualities; there is, of course, no totemism in all this; Henry, La magie dans l'Inde antique, pp. xxviii, 87, 95. 

* Cf. Murray's theory (Four Stages of Greek Religion, p. 37), which holds that the victim is devoured not as divine, but merely to obtain its mana, the diviniza-

Vedic Ritual 

[Part III 

apparently the same idea is to be seen in the sprinkling of the mola salsa on the head of the victim in the Roman ritual and of melted butter in the Vedic rite. Now in the Vedic ritual, as in the Roman, we find a considerable amount of evidence of the eating of the offering by the priests, after the god had partaken of it. The essential feature of the ordinary sacrifice is expressed in the solemn invocation of the Iḍā,1 the sacrificial food derived from the cow, which is repeatedly conceived in cow form. She is invoked to come forward, and she is expressly called a cow, and, when the god has eaten, shares in her are con- sumed by the priests and by the sacrificer, in so far as he is qualified by being a Brahman to partake of the food. The latter restriction is one which we can only prove for the later period of the Vedic ritual, but the position of the priest at the outset of the ritual is such as to render it most probable that the rule was always in full operation in the historical period. The same practice applied to all normal kinds of offering, the animal sacrifice and the Soma sacrifice included, though we find in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa3 that the king is excluded at the royal consecration from the use of Soma and given Sură instead. The same rule applies to the Gṛhya ritual: it is laid down that a man should eat nothing without making an offering of a portion of it, every meal when an animal is killed for a guest is, as in Homer, a sacrifice.1 A Snātaka, or Brahman student, after he has taken the final bath concluding the student- ship, is allowed to eat remains of food offered to the gods and to the Manes : in the latter permission, as in the rule that the wife, who wishes offspring, should eat a portion of the food offered to the Fathers,3 we must doubtless see the idea of placing oneself in close touch with the Fathers. In an offering to Kṣetrapati," in which the god is represented by a bull, the remains of the food are duly eaten by the relatives, and in another offering, the Madhuparka, the Rudras, Adityas, and the All-gods are first fed, then the sacrificer, and then a Brahman: if there is no Brahman available, then the food may either be thrown into water, or the whole may be consumed by the sacrificer. The practice is interesting: it is clear that in the domestic ritual the rule that the only person who may eat the food is the Brahman is not in force: the sacri- ficer, who is the householder himself--and who may of course be himself a Brahman, but need not be--and his relatives have the first claim: after that

the food which by its contact with the divinity is clearly specially valuable is either given to Brahmans, or disposed of in an effectual way. The ritual in many cases preserves express statements of the relation of the sacrificer to the sacrifice: if he does not eat a portion of it, he is excluding himself from it,1 the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa says; but at the same time it is clear that it is rather a serious business: the hot milk in the Dadhigharma offering is expressly asked not to injure the partaker of it. In some cases the idea of community resulting from the sacrifice seems clearly marked: thus the newly married couple, after their first entry into the common home, share food together from an offering made by the husband;3 in the ceremony of the initiation of a pupil the teacher gives the pupil to eat of the offering which has just been made, saying, May Agni place wisdom in thee'; the sacrificer partakes of 

' the offering of butter, which he and the priest have together touched before the sacrifice of Soma, and thus embodies in himself the idea of fidelity which was created by the touching; the mothe eats part of the food which is given with ceremonial rites to the infant as its first solid nutriment, a practice in which Oldenberg sees the idea of securing for her future children the strength given by the rite to the existing child, but which is far more simply explained as a mere ceremony of communion. Possibly here too may be added the case of the ass sacrifice of the Brahman student which has already been noted: it may be conceived that the victim is made efficacious for its special purpose by the bringing it near to the god by sacrifice.

♦ 

The same efficacy of the sacrifice is to be seen in cases where the offering produces its result by contact, not by ordinary eating. Thus in place of eating food together the husband and wife may rub each other's hearts with the offering, and at the end of the three days of continence enjoined upon them the remains of the offerings are rubbed into the body of the bride.10 Similarly, if on the way to their home the car breaks, an offering is made, and the remains rubbed on the mended part.11 The horses which are to engage in the race in the Vajapeya sniff the offering in order to gain swiftness; 

12 the cows are driven so as to snuff the fragrance of the offering made in the fire; 13 in the Soma sacrifice, the Väjapeya, the piling of the fire, and the Sautrāmaṇī alike occur cases in which the offering is used to rub the sacrificer to convey to him strength and healing.14 At the animal sacrifice by touching the victim the

sacrificer is brought into contact with the sacrifice, and when, in the case of an offering to Rudra, the cakes are hung up on a tree, the sacrificer should touch them and win healing power.* 

On the other hand, when the deities to whom the offerings are made are terrible, it is clearly natural that the offering should be regarded as not suitable for human consumption: in Greece the offerings to the dead and the chthonian divinities were not normally eaten. So in India, when rice cakes are offered to the Fathers, the sacrificer refrains from eating them: he merely smells them : * it is normally not right to partake of an offering to Rudra ; if an offering is made for one who seeks thus to find death, at the consecration one should only smell, not taste: 5 in another case, the Dadhigharma, or offering of hot sour milk, the remains of the sacrifice may be eaten by priests who have undergone the consecration, but not by others who are less well fortified for the risk: it is the native explanation," and it is reasonable enough to hold that the mere smelling is a compromise between the necessity of partaking as normally and the danger of the action. The terrible character of the offering is further indicated by other usages: when an offering is made to the Rakṣases, to Rudra, to the Fathers, or the Asuras, or when an im- precation is made, the sacrificer should touch water. When an offering is made to the Fathers, in one case, the sacrificer looks north, whereas the quarter of the Fathers is the south; when he offers to Rudra, he looks south, for Rudra's place is in the north, and the offerer is constantly bidden not to turn round after an offering to Rudra, which is explicable only by the view that the dread god is on the scene in bodily presence. We may here also include the theory, already mentioned, of some theologians that the victim to Agni and Soma at the Agniṣṭoma should not be eaten it may have seemed to some that the presence of the gods Agni and Soma made the victim too dangerous to permit of close contact. But the general rule was that it should be eaten as is in one case expressly stated. 

9 

On the other hand, it was always possible to eat of even the offering to a dread god; thus in the case of the offering of an animal to the god Rudra,10 which is to be made in a part from which the village cannot be seen, we meet with the same phenomenon as has already been seen in two cases in which it is

But this is wholly illegitimate: the animal is not divine at all in AGS. or PGS., and is not banished in HGS. or ApGS. That the rite is known to the Rigveda is wholly unproved.

allowed to eat of an offering to the dead. It is expressly said that the sacrificer must not eat any part of the victim, that he must not let the wind of it blow upon him, that he must not take any part of it into the village, and that he must keep his folk away from the place of offering, all clear proofs of the pre- sence of the god, but it is also stated that he may eat of it on an express injunction, and that then the eating will bring him great luck. It is an error to underestimate1 the value of this evidence: it proves that the nature of the effect on the offering is to fill it with holy power, and that the eating of part of it conveys that holy power, which may be well worth having in some special cases, though normally when Rudra is the god concerned men may not care to come too near to it. From this point of view also we can understand the true force of the fact that the blood of the victim was not partaken of by the priest and the sacrificer: in this Hillebrandt 3 has seen a ground of dis- tinction between the Indian and the Semitic theory of sacrifice, in which the blood is precisely the essential thing, which the worshippers desire to share, as is seen in the horrid Arabian rite reported by Nilus in which the worshippers eat the victim uncooked and take care to save all the blood, while in the Vedic view the blood is impure and given to the Rakṣases. It is not that the blood 

is impure it is rather that it is particularly full of the divine power, doubtless as the seat of life of the animal, and the part into which the divine spirit can most easily enter, and thus is offered not to men but to spirits, often it is clear to the snakes" as the representatives of the earth spirit, an idea which explains also the Greek theory of purification by blood: the person purified thus by the use of blood places himself in communion with the goddess of the earth." 

7 

It is true that, as has been pointed out by Oldenberg and others, the theory of the sacrifice as a communion with the deity, whether by the direct rite of eating with him, or as a sacrament through eating a victim, which has become impregnated in some degree with the deity, is not recognized as such in the formulae of the ritual: we simply find nothing of the view that the worshippers are eating together with the god in order to renew their relationship. The solitary prescription above mentioned regarding the victim to Agni and Soma does not hint at this view at all: it merely refers to the theory which is several times expressed in the Brāhmaṇas that man is the

original victim,1 and that other victims are substitutes. We might expect to find the theory recognized in the case of the Soma sacrifice, when Soma was identified with the moon, and the Brāhmaṇas * do tell us that Soma is killed when he is pressed for the Soma drink, and that what is drunk at the rite is the moon, but all this remains merely an expression of the fact that the moon decays and is supposed to be drunk up by the gods in heaven, and analogously by the gods on earth, the priests who have the knowledge of the mystery of the identity of the Soma plant and the moon. The conditions which might have developed a conception of the sacrifice as a communion of men both inter se and with the god, and as a sacrament through the feeding on a victim which is really an embodiment of the god, were present only in germ, and they do not seem to have generated the consciousness of the sacramental nature of the offering, although the effort to assimilate the victim to the god was always present and effective. The victim was preferably an animal which was a theriomorphic form of the god, bulls to Indra, goats to Pûṣan and to Agni, and so on; the sex was assimilated and the colour chosen with regard to the nature of the god.3 None the less we must admit that, whatever the reason, the Indians of the Vedic period, like the Romans, differed radically and vitally from the Semites who practised the sacramental sacrifice in the fact that, though the animal victim might be chosen for its close connexion with the deity and in the actual offering be filled with the divinity, they did not in their normal thought press this view to the conclusion that the offering really caused the death of the god. Further, though the Vedic Indian recognized that by eating the remains of the offering he was bringing himself into close com- munion with the divine power and that the victim was in some sense semi- divine, he did not feel that in the death of the victim there was perishing some person essentially of kin to him, and therefore to be lamented, as the per- formers of Greek sacrifices in several cases may have lamented the victim, or for whose death punishment was necessary, as suggested by the ritual of the Bouphonia. Even in animal sacrifice there is no trace of kinship with man, though we have the clearest evidence of the desire to deprecate the anger of the kin of the dead beast and the recognition of the fact that the victim will have power to confer richness in cattle as acceptable to the gods, and there is no trace in the ritual of disapproval of the slayer as suggested by Hubert and Mauss."

It is difficult also to ascertain what element of ecstatic enjoyment of the sense of union with the deity entered into the sacrificial ritual.a

we learn later, once appeared in bodily presence at the offering, but had ceased to do so, but this is not conclusive against the natural belief that the singers in their sacrifices believed themselves actually to behold the gods whom they invoked. We find prayers for the eye of Agni to enable the worshipper to behold the demons and sorcerers, a plant has the power to make demons visible, the dicer sees the dancing Apsarases, and in the stress of battle we may safely assume that Indians who prayed to their gods had visions, as in medieval or modern days, in which they beheld the objects of their invocation lending them divine aid. Especially in the invocations of Indra, the Maruts, and the Aśvins, all gods of especially concrete character, who are of present help in time of trouble, do we find indications which suggest that the priest believed that the gods would, if duly praised, reveal themselves to his longing vision. Possibly too we may reckon here the prayers in the Apri hymns which bid the divine doors open wide to admit the gods to the offering, and the conception of the path of the gods to the heaven may be due to this cause. The Fathers, we know, appeared to their worshippers, for we hear of Yatus who smuggle themselves in among them assuming their form. 

$ 

The offering produces also another sense of communion, in the divine ecstasy produced by the Soma drink. The Vedic poets have not the gift of imaginative description of a Euripides, and we find but little expression of the state of mind produced by imbibing the powerful potion. Still it is clear that those who drink can say, We have found the light, we have become immortal,' and that they truly feel the joy they asserted, even if they cannot claim, like the partaker of the sacred rite at Eleusis, 'to have escaped evil and found what is better'. The classical expression of this ecstatic state is found in the hymn which tradition, in all probability with justice, holds to be the ex- pression of Indra's mind after he has drunk the Soma. The worlds are his plaything, he rises aloft in his joy, he speeds on the wings of the wind. Ecstasy, naturally enough, is specially the product of drinking the Soma, who is hailed as the kind friend and father, who grants length of days, for this boon is eagerly desired by the Vedic mystic, as it is by the later Yogin. But similar powers are ascribed by the Atharvaveda to the remains of the sacrificial offering, full of the divine power, and to the porridge (odana)," which, eaten, gives the worshipper the feeling of attaining the heaven, and in the Agni worship there are fainter traces of the development of a more refined form of mystic speculative activity. 

Another aspect of sacrifice which has some affinity to a spell and a sacra- ment is that emphasized by Hubert and Mauss in their theory of the nature of sacrifice, based on the evidence in the main of the Old Testament and the

Vedic Ritual 

[Part III 

Vedic ritual. Their attention has been attracted by the fact that a sacrifice produces a definite effect in the performer and the means which he employs : he is filled with a sacred spirit as is the victim which he offers, a fact of which we have already seen instances, and which cannot be for a moment called in question. The Dikșă or preliminary consecration, and the concluding bath, which provides a means of removing from man in some degree the excessive sanctity with which he has become endued in the process of offering, are significant proofs of this aspect of sacrifice. The sacrifice, many as are the uses which can be made of it, has an essential unity in that it aims at the establishment of communication between the sacred and the profane world by means of a victim, that is, a thing which is destroyed in the course of the ceremony. As opposed to Robertson Smith, the authors lay stress on the fact that the victim acquires its sacred character in the rite, and does not possess it normally ab extra, a fact which makes it well adapted for the accomplishment of the most varied ends: the current which runs through it can pass to the sky from the earth or vice versa equally well. The motive of this desire to enter into relations with the powers above is simple enough: man sees in them the source of life, and is anxious to attain as close contact with them as possible. But immediate contact would be fatal, and would unfit man for secular life, as is indeed the case with priests of too great sanctity like the unfortunate Flamen Dialis1 or the Emperor of Japan: therefore he interposes an inter- mediary, who at the same time serves as a substitute for the sacrificer himself. This victim must be dispatched to the other world: its soul is liberated by death, with its own permission, for it becomes by the sacrifice a powerful being which no man would seek to irritate, and its body thereafter may be destroyed, whether by being consumed entirely by fire as in the Hebrew holocaust, or by being eaten by the priest or the worshippers, or again its skin or other portion may merely be brought into close contact with the worshipper. Incidentally the sacrifice accomplishes much more than its mere immediate aim: if the victim offered by the consecrated man serves to secure him his close relationship with the gods, it also sends the spirit of the victim to strengthen and multiply the species. All sacrifice is essentially social: it involves negation by the individual, but it strengthens the divine which is the ideal representative of the social unit, and thus indirectly benefits the indivi- dual himself. A further development of sacrifice in its ideal form is the con- ception of the sacrifice of the god himself, when the intermediary disappears in toto. 

Brilliant as is the presentation of this theory, it is difficult not to feel that it is open to the same objection as must be taken to the theory of religion presented by Durkheim * in his exposition of totemism as the earliest stage of religion. Religion with him also is essentially a social fact: the totem is the

material object in which the conception of the unity of the primitive social group materializes itself. In both theories we have a tendency to find in primitive religion conceptions of too great elaboration and difficulty. Durk- heim himself, however, does not abandon the gift theory in practice: he regards the gift as essential: the gods created by the collective mind of the group are the protectors and guardians of the group, but at the same time they require the gifts of the individuals to secure their existence and power. It is clear that much of Hubert and Mauss's theory is borne out by facts, and the doctrine that in the sacrifice the victim becomes peculiarly holy is valuable and correct, accounting naturally as it does for many peculiarities of the sacrifice, and affording in all probability the best explanation of the origin and development of the doctrine of slaying a god. But the view that the sacrifice is primarily an offering to please the god seems to be borne out by every probability, and by the undoubted fact that the sacrifice was normally so understood throughout antiquity. In this regard it is impossible ot to feel that the authors have allowed themselves to be influenced unduly by the theories of the Brāhmaṇas as to the nature of sacrifice, and have underestimated the purely speculative and learned character of these suggestions. The objection to the gift theory insisted upon by Jevons which represents it as unworthy of the relation of god and man is open to the criticism that it sets too high a standard for the beginning of religion. Moreover, the gift theory of sacrifice has the advantage that it affords in conjunction with other simple conceptions a perfectly natural origin for the various forms of offering: the sacramental rite in its simplest form of eating with the god follows naturally from the primitive conception that a sharing the same food confers similarity of nature, assisted perhaps, as Jevons holds, by the joyous feast celebrated by the worshippers at the moment when they feel that by their offering they have deprecated the wrath of the god and secured his loving-kindness to themselves and their families. From this form of the sacramental meal, coupled with the principle of sanctity of the offering at the sacrifice, is easily deduced the view that the victim which is being offered is the god himself embodied for the time being in the victim: Jevons himself explains in a somewhat analogous way the conception of eating the god which found a place in the Mexican worship. But it would doubtless be a mistake to assume that the idea of the death of the god was always produced in this way only: we must take into account the life and death of nature and the harvest rites in which the spirit of the corn is assumed to die in the cutting of the corn, and to revive in the growth of the young corn in the spring, and in which the spirit of the corn, when the harvest is reaped, though outworn, is deemed to seek to avoid its doom by passing into some animal, bird, or man, and is killed in order that it may revive afresh in the spring. But this conception is not developed in Vedic ritual so far as it is recorded, nor has it any necessary connexion with sacrifice: moreover, it is at least probable that in many cases there has been confusion between the

[Part III 

killing of evil spirits, wizards supposed to endanger the crop, and the slaying of corn spirits proper.1 In Vedic religion at any rate the conception of grain as containing a spirit is hardly to be found: the one piece of evidence from the ceremony of the Varunapraghasas 2 adduced by Hubert and Mauss 3 is far from being convincing. 

4 

Jevons * insists that all sacrifice involves essentially the idea of drawing near to the god and making an offering to secure his favour, a step adopted originally when the community felt that its god was alien from it through the misconduct of one of its members, and had to be propitiated by tokens of repentance. The offering brought need not be consumable; if it were, it might easily be eaten after acceptance by the worshippers in a festival of joy at the feeling of reunion with their god. At first offerings are only occasional, evoked by fear of the anger of the god, who, however, is recognized to be justly wrath and to be also merciful and willing to forgive his worshippers, but the habit of solemn feasting on these occasions is gradually adopted in respect of the harvest fruits, when, as in the case of the occasional offerings, the wor- shippers first sacrifice to the god, before they partake of the fruits of the earth. But, as the fruits are thus sacred, they come to be regarded as divine, and as divine they take the rank of deities, the spirits of vegetation, to whom he denies in their own right divine status. Sacrifice thus is from the first much more than a gift offering or covenant offering; it is also not a communion feast, though both the gift and the communion theory of sacrifice are natural ways of interpreting the rite, which are adopted by the worshippers. In his view the gift theory is essentially irreligious; from it no true religion could spring. This, however, appears a decidedly dubious assertion; it is by no means obvious that the presenting of gifts to a god in the hope of favour, without consciousness of sin or divine wrath, is not an essentially primitive form of sacrifice. 

## 5. The Materials of the Sacrifice 

On the gift theory of sacrifice it is natural that man should offer what he delights to feed upon, and in point of fact this undoubtedly is the rule in the great majority of cases: the Vedic Indians practised agricultural as well as pastoral pursuits, and we find therefore that they offered to the gods, not only milk in its various forms, as curd or melted butter in several varieties, but also grain, barley and rice, which served to make different kinds of cakes, or were mixed with milk or curds to form variegated messes. These materials served to satisfy many needs, but the animal and the Soma offerings were of still greater consequence in the eyes of the priest, though they must have been numerically very few in comparison with the sacrifices of simple materials.

Libations of water, not of blood as in Greece, for the dead were evidently directly connected with the conception of the thirst of the Fathers. Wild products such as wheat or sesame were reserved for Rudra, sesame grains were peculiar to the dead, and a puerile desire to assimilate the offerings to the gods appears in the rules that for Night and Dawn an offering of milk from a black cow with a white calf was appropriate,1 that for the dead should be used the milk of a cow which has lost its own and is bringing up a strange calf,2 that black 3 rice is the proper offering to Nirṛti,* that cakes for Agni should be offered on eight, those for Indra on eleven, those for the Adityas on twelve potsherds, because the metres connected with these deities have those numbers of syllables, and so on in unending detail.

The Brahmaņas set forth a list of five victims among animals, man, the horse, oxen, sheep, and goats: in practice the last three are the common victims, and the goat is the most usual of all: wild animals, fish, birds, the pig, and the dog are excluded; the last tw were not eaten, the others rarely, but it is possible that in their case practical difficulties may explain their exclusion from use. At the horse sacrifice, it is true, enormous lists of offerings of all sorts of animals are enumerated: the rule is, however, admitted that the wild animals were to be set free, and it is absurd to suppose that the lists were ever seriously meant to be followed. On the other hand, the offering of the horse is contrary to the practice, for the eating of horse-flesh, though never in all likelihood unknown in India, and though practised by many peoples in ancient, medieval, and modern times, seems rare in India. It may be con- sidered as serving either to make swift the god, who thus appropriates the swiftness of the animal offered, and through the god to strengthen the man, or as is less likely it may be held to be merely dictated by the desire directly to secure the offerer the strength of the steed, or again it may be due merely to the feeling that the highest beast is in place at a great offering: to this question we shall return again. In the case of the offering of an ass to Nirṛti the aim to secure the replacement of virility by the offerer is obvious, and reduces the offering to its real character, a magic rite dignified by the intro- duction of the goddess and the form of sacrifice. The offering of a fish-otter to Apāṁ Napāt is possibly to be attributed to the same idea: the otter suggests and creates the desired water, but it may also fall under the general rule of assimilation of the victim to the nature of the deity.

Vedic Ritual 

[Part III 

This practice of assimilation is obvious and natural: it is not indeed strictly logical that, because a god is said to be a bull, he should eat bulls, for the Vedic Indian never in any time known to us thought that Indra or any other god 1 was merely a bull, but the connexion of ideas by which, in choosing a special victim, the form of the god suggested the choice is plain and obvious, and agrees with the conception that by eating certain animals certain qualities are attained by men; by eating bulls the god strengthens his nature in its bull aspect. Hence we find that Indra receives bulls and buffaloes,* Pûṣan goats, Agni with his fire and smoke a goat with a black neck, the Maruts a speckled cow or a speckled animal because of their speckled mother, the ruddy Aśvins a red goat," the sun and Yama a white and a black goat respectively, Tvaṣtr a special kind of goat because it occurs in his myth, and so on. But we must not exaggerate the rule of agreement whether in character, sex, or colour. The Maruts sometimes have a barren cow or a ewe, Sarasvati a he-goat, Mitra and Varuna a barren cow ; 7 in other cases the colour depends on the object of the offering, not on the god, as when a black victim brings rain, and a red victim is offered by a priest with red raiment to destroy a foe. It is possible, of course, that cases where the sex of the victim does not agree may be explained 10 by changes in the ritual, which has altered the allocation of victims to different gods, but for this theory there is hardly any real ground, as the rule of correspondence in Indian as in Greek and Roman religion is merely an approximate rule, and of no more than empirical validity. 

The victim has to be killed, so that it shall make no sound and so that there shall be no effusion of blood: it seems to have been usually strangled: the cruel method of killing recorded by Haug is not shown to have existed at any early period.1 

11 Stress is laid in the verse addressed to it on the fact that it is not really being killed. The omentum of the victim, a part rich in fat, is then extracted and offered up thereafter the remaining parts are divided for offering, a rice cake is offered, portions of the remainder of the flesh are offered to the gods with formulae recalling the fact that the omentum has already been used, and the priest and other Brahmans eat the rest, keeping only the tail for the final part of the rite. The same division of the ceremony is observed in the animal offerings to the Fathers made at the Aṣṭaka offering, and the distinction must be very old.12 The separate treatment of the omentum

is proved for the Iranians by Strabo,1 who explains that the soul only of the victim was given to the gods, except that a small piece of the omentum was put in the fire, and a corresponding distinction is to be found in the directions of Leviticus regarding the sin and other offerings. It certainly seems to have been an early idea that the burning of the omentum made a sweet smell for the god the Zulus burn it while leaving the rest of the victim untouched, believing that the spirits come and partake of it without leaving any trace of their feast. In this may be seen some evidence of the process of the transfer of the use of fire to its later employment as the normal way of conveying the offering to the gods.3 The blood, as we have seen, was left for the Rakṣases,* along with the excrements, &c., of the victim, with which may be compared the practice of offering to the same powers oddments of the offerings of grain- stuffs, perhaps merely to deprecate their interference by this cheap form of sacrifice; but it is possible, as we have seen, that the offering to the Rakṣases must be taken seriously as an offering to ch honian powers of the earth, as is suggested by the fact that the snakes are often conceived as receiving blood. 

There is nothing here to interfere with the usual view that the sacrifice is essentially a gift offering, not a relic of totemism, or of the offering of a vegeta- tion spirit or, earlier, of a spirit of animal life, in order to keep it ever young, No such explanation is at all requisite in order to explain the connexion of the gods with particular victims, nor to explain the silent death of the victim, from which the principal celebrants avert their heads, or the efforts to per- suade it that it is not being killed, a device applied also to the tree which is being cut for the sacrificial post. The death of the victim is that of an animal with a soul which could be wroth, and also full of the divine spirit-- sometimes so full, as in the case of the victim for Agni and Soma, that some would not eat of it--and it is a dreadful thing, therefore, to slay it, though necessary. Apart, however, from the place of offering, the animal is merely an ordinary animal, and therefore it is difficult to read into the sacrifice more than the theory of a gift, sometimes with magic qualities." 

The question of the human sacrifice is of importance, as in it we should expect to find, if anywhere, the clearest recognition of the nature of sacrifice. Here, however, the material is wholly inadequate to establish any result. In one case we have perfectly good proof that down to a comparatively late date

Vedic Ritual 

[Part III 

in the building up of the great altar for the fire ritual, a construction of such elaboration that it was doubtless a rare feature in the ritual, it was customary to sacrifice five victims, including a man, to build their heads into the altar, and to throw, their bodies into the water whence the clay for the making of fire-bricks was taken, in order to give it abiding strength. Here, however, we cannot ignore the obvious fact that under the fashion of a sacrifice, last per- formed on earth by Cyaparṇa Sayakayana, we have dressed up the old practice of giving a building strength by associating it with guardian spirits of the dead, a usage which has persisted in India down to the most recent times. The other cases in which human sacrifices have been seen are extremely doubtful. The ritual texts, indeed, and some late Brāhmaṇa evidence agree in describing a Puruṣamedha, ‘human sacrifice', which follows but on a more gorgeous scale the horse sacrifice. We have no reason to believe that it was ever a primitive rite: the effort of Hillebrandt 2 to show that the passage in the funeral hymn in the Rigveda,3 which has been supposed to apply to the widow of the dead man in the funeral service, really applies to the widow of the king, who is supposed, as in the horse sacrifice, to lie beside the victim, is a tour de force. If ever the sacrifice was performed, it must merely have been an isolated act, produced by the speculations of the priests. There is clear evidence that the sacrifice of the mythical Purușa was in some cases at least taken as the model of the supposed human sacrifice. Possibly here and there myth generated the ritual: there is no conceivable reason to believe in view of the evidence that the ritual generated the myth. 

4 

More worth consideration perhaps is the legend of Çunahśepa; `in it Hariścandra the king promises to sacrifice his son to Varuna, if the god will give him a son: but, when the child is attained, he defers the offering until he manages to obtain a Brahman Ajigarta, who consents to sell his son Çunahśepa for a vicarious sacrifice, the king having been afflicted by Varuna with dropsy and thus recalled to the sense of his duty. When the father binds the son to the post and is about to slay him, the gods set him free in answer to his prayer and he is adopted by one of the priests present at the rite, Viśvāmitra, leaving his wicked father, while Varuņa frees the king from his disease. The sacrifice was to have taken place at the royal consecration and the rule is laid down that at the consecration of the king the priest must tell the tale, and thus free the king from all sin and the fetters of Varuņa. It has been suggested therefore, very naturally, by Weber 5 that we have here the trace of an old practice of human sacrifice at the rite which has been abolished, the tale instead showing how the practice was done away with. The story, as it is recorded, is obviously meaningless, as the king undertakes to slay the son which is sent to him, and the motive is as it stands therefore an absurd one.

The Brahman Ajīgarta fares very hardly at the hands of the narrator, and one motive in it is clearly the connexion of Çunaḥśepa with the family of Viśvä- mitra. The most that can be deduced from it in favour of human sacrifice is that it is possibly a far-off and dim reminiscence of a possible offering of the son of a king in time of distress as a sin offering. Obviously such a story allows us to see in it other explanations, for instance that it is an echo of the slaying of the divine king or of his son in him--if so, a very distant and dis- torted echo, or that it is due to totemism. In view, however, of the lack of better evidence of any kind for totemism or slaying the divine king,' the piacular explanation may stand, if it is realized that the tradition is clearly so distorted that we do not know what it means. The conclusion is an im- portant one in later India there are not a few traces of human sacrifice, and offerings to Kāli have taken place within recent years: the aborigines had clearly no hesitation in following certain forms of worship which involved human sacrifice,2 but the Brahmans remaine, like the Roman priests, superior to this particularly unlovable peculiarity of the human mind. 

The most important of all offerings in the eyes of the priest was certainly the Soma, as is proved by the fact that the Rigveda in the main is a collection based on the Soma sacrifice, though not exclusively devoted to it. The question of the origin and nature of the plant is insoluble: the efforts made to identify it have led to interesting investigations, but to no sure result, and the only thing certain is that the plant, which has been used in modern India as the Soma plant, is one which would not be considered by modern tastes as at all pleasant in the form of pressed juice mixed with water. We are unable naturally to say what would seem pleasant to the Vedic Indian: we know that surfeit in the drink had disagreeable results. Curiously enough too we do not know whether the drink was really popular outside the circle of priests, who took it sacrificially: there is just enough evidence in the Rigveda * to suggest that it was a popular drink, though the normal civil drink is Surā.

In Çunahśepa's case we should have to admit the custom of sacrificing the son in place of the king (Frazer, The Dying God, pp. 160 ff.) and to hold that the king really wanted a son in order to save his own life, all of which is absurd.

on the other: that it was intoxicating is proved by the ill repute in which it normally was held, and by its very limited use at the sacrifice, in the Sautră- maņi, where it figures in the rite by which excess in Soma drinking is cured, and at the Vājapeya, in both cases in rites which appear to owe their present form to priestly action. There is, however, enough evidence to indicate that the corresponding Avestan Hura was used in the offering. 

1 

Oldenberg 1 is inclined to suggest that the plant was never very popular : that it really took the place of the old Indo-European mead," and that therefore it was traditionally the subject of sacred use and appreciation with- out having any very real claim to pleasantness of character. It is possible that this was so, but it is not very natural, and it seems more reasonable to suppose that the mead of the older period was fully replaced by a really pleasant drink. The term Madhu, which is properly honey, is applied to it in the Rigveda, though not in the Avesta: the origin of the use is uncertain : it is especially connected in the mythology with the Aśvins, and in point of fact it seems to have been originally offered to them in the Dadhigharma offering, though in the ritual as recorded the offering is practically confined to milk. It is possible, therefore, that in point of fact honey as well as milk might be mixed with the Soma, though it is also true that the term ' honey' in the Veda is applied in the most promiscuous way as to the milk or butter of the cow, or to the waters of the rain. On the whole, however, we are hardly entitled to doubt that the drink was originally a really pleasant one in the course of time the long distance from which the shoots had to be brought may easily have made it less attractive, as it certainly encouraged the use of various substitutes described in the ritual text-books.

There is no ground on which any totemist nature can be applied to the Soma sacrifice : much as the Brahmans speculated on the question," there is no real proof that the offering ever really lost its true character, that of the offering to a god, in the main Indra, of the intoxicating and exhilarating drink, and the share in the drink by the priest. The killing of king Soma in the pressing, the eating of the substance of the moon, were no doubt seen by the ingenuity of the Brahmans, but these are speculations, not Vedic religion. 

In some cases it is true that we find alleged sacrifices of things which cannot be regarded as eatable or indeed of any use to the gods at all. In these cases the explanation is simple: a magic rite is dressed up as an offering: if a man seeks a hundred years, the normal term of life, and offers a hundred nails of

Khadira wood, he turns a magic rite into a sacrifice pro forma: similarly, if he offers manure to produce plenteousness in cattle, or gives the sacrificer the strength of a lion, wolf, and tiger by mixing in the oblation at the Sautră- mani hairs of these animals. Such cases are instructive as they show that the idea that the horse sacrifice might in itself merely be intended to secure to the sacrificer the strength and swiftness of the horse is by no means absurd or unreasonable, even if it is not quite a complete view of the rite.

## 6. Fire and Sacrifice 

The constant interrelation of magic and religion in the Vedic cult is seen in its most complete form in the position of the fire, which serves the double end of the mode in which the sacrifice is brought to the gods, and of the most effective agency for the banning of evil spirits. The Vedic hymns show clearly enough the enormous value of the fire for the driving away of the Rakṣases, and the ritual bears this out in the most marked manner. There is lighted a special fire, the Sūtikāgni, in place of the normal fire for the woman in child- birth it is not used for any offering except for the fumigation of the newly born infant and the warming of dishes, but its object of driving off evil spirits is attested by the list of evil spirits who are banned in the ritual. The hair- cutting of the child is likewise performed to the west of a fire, which is not used for any offering, though utensils of the rite are put around it. The teacher initiates his pupil and girds on the sacred girdle, which marks his second birth, in the presence of a fire, but in this case the making of an offering in it shows the tendency to mingle religion and magic: the recitation goes on in the presence of a fire. Such a fire is absolutely essential, when the passages recited are of special importance and therefore holiness." The consecration of the offerer of Soma takes place before a fire; after a death, fire is used to drive away the evil powers, fire is used even in battle, the third of the holy fires of the ritual seems to have been intended from the first to drive away evil spirits: the south is the region of the Fathers and of the demons akin to them, and, when it is being used for offerings to the Fathers, a brand is taken out from it to drive away the evil spirits, which seek to have a share in the sacrifice, 10 

A further important function of the fire as used at the ritual is cathartic in a different way: at the end of the offering it is desirable to remove from possibility of human contact the apparatus of the sacrifice, which has been filled by its use at the sacrifice with a superhuman character and danger.

strew of grass, which covers the altar, is burnt, and the same mode of disposal is applied to the Svāru or chip of wood, which is used for several mystical purposes at the animal offering, the ointment used for the anointing of the piler of the fire altar, the twig with which at the new and full moon offerings the calves are driven away from the cows which are to give the milk, the spits used at the animal sacrifice for holding the pieces of the victim: the idea animating these usages, and the parallel one of burying such dangerous objects, is illustrated very clearly 1 by the rule that the spit which has been used for the heart of the victim, the seat of life, must not be laid on the earth or water, but must be buried in secret, the burier turning away without looking back. A further kind of purification is the final bath at the end of the offering and the use of washing: the sense of cleansing and destroying is seen in the practice of letting things float away on water. 

1 

In addition to these uses the practice observed in the burning of the omentum in the first place for the deities, in order at least in part to convey a pleasant savour, must be reckoned as a function of the fire, and further there must be borne in mind the case where the fire itself was adored: the natural way of serving the fire was, and must have been, to offer the oblations directly in it, and thus to let the god taste in actual presence the gifts of his adorers. 

These different uses of the fire suggest the process by which the practice of sacrifice among the Iranians came to be changed in the Vedic period. The evidence of Herodotos 2 we have no ground to doubt, and he is quite clear that the Persians used no fire: the victim was cut up, and the flesh laid down on grass, the Magos recited over it what he calls a Theogony, and after a short time the sacrificer took away the flesh and did what he liked with it. The grass on which the victim is laid is beyond possibility of doubt the strew, Barhis, of India: the Avestan name Baresman is undoubtedly cognate, though differently formed, and the Avesta used of it the expression fra-star, 'spread out', which is the Vedic stṛ. But in the Avesta, for reasons which we do not know, the strew became a bundle of grass tied together, which is used for various purposes. In the Rigveda the strew is clearly often still thought of as the place to which the gods come to receive the offerings, but the fire has its essential place within the altar, ready for the burning of the offerings. Hence we meet that constant confusion noted already in the conceptions of the functions of Agni: he is bidden on the one hand to carry the offerings to the god in the other he is to invite them to come and to sit down on the strew

to partake of the offerings: the two ideas are actually found in the same hymn.1 The character of the strew is seen also in the rule that the gifts to the gods are first deposited on it, and that anything which falls upon it is not counted as wasted 2 and so unfit for offering. The exact form of the process of develop- ment by which the fire came to be treated as the normal mode of the offering to the deity is uncertain: the making of a sweet odour may have been adopted, even when the gods were still supposed to come to the strew, in order perhaps to call their attention to the performance of the offering, and to attract them there; the strew and perhaps even the remains of the offering were burnt as too full of holy power to be safe to keep, or sometimes even in the case of the offerings to eat; the fire has a strong power to drive off demons, or the fire was the actual god to whom the offering was made, all reasons from which the new use could arise. But it must be remembered that it never became the sole manner of offering: the throwing of gifts to water deities in the waters is a natural and common use; the placing of food in pits for the dead is a very old and common usage; the offerings to Rudra and other demoniac figures may be placed in ant-heaps, a sort of natural entrance to the earth, or hung on trees, or even merely thrown in the air.* 

The Vedic ritual, however, is long past the period when the use of fire originated the Crauta ritual demands not one but three fires, and the time when the three were the mere expansion of the one is far behind the Rigveda : we find already there a distinction between the ordinary fire and the three fires of the more elaborate ritual.” Each householder is bound by the ritual texts, if he be pious, to keep one fire and in it each day to perform the cult of the house: the rich, nobles and princes, and even men of lower status, who can afford it, maintain in the same way a set of three fires, and with them a number of priests who are essential to the carrying on of the cult. In both cases certain ceremonies may be performed, and indeed ought to be performed, the offering night and morning of the Agnihotra, the new and full moon sacrifices, and the difference in the two modes of performance is one only of elaboration. Many other kind of cereal and animal offerings are also available for performance in both ways, but the family rites proper, those deeply affecting private matters, are only allowed to be performed in the domestic fire, while on the other hand the Soma sacrifice cannot be performed without the whole of the three fires. The great sacrificer therefore has the three fires beside the domestic fire: the older position that on great occasions

the domestic fire was divided into three is suggested quite irresistibly by the name of the one of the three fires, which occurs in the Rigveda, the Gårha- patya, which means clearly the fire of the householder, and must have derived its name from the domestic fire, but it had disappeared before the tradition begins. It is a natural conjecture that it was in the Soma ritual that the origin of the fires developed, but it is not capable of proof. Nor is there any evidence at all that the three fires represent an amalgamation of different forms of fire worship. The number suggests such a conclusion, but the mere fact of the number is of course not sufficient evidence and of other proof none is forthcoming. 

3 

2 

Of the three fires the Gärhapatya alone was continually maintained : the other fires, the Āhavaniya and the Dakṣiņa, were derived from it, and the leading forward of the fire is already referred to in the Rigveda, though it is not possible to prove that the process was identical with that applied in the ritual. The central position of the Gärhapatya is also to be seen in its relation to the man who goes on a journey: he takes formal leave of it first and then of the Ahavaniya, on his return he as solemnly greets first the Ahavaniya, and then the Garhapatya. The Ahavaniya, with which Hillebrandt seeks to identify the Vaiśvanara of the Rigveda, is the fire for the offering, not that, as a Brāhmaṇa says, in which the cooking is done, but that in which the cooked food is made over to the gods: the Garhapatya therefore serves to cook the food and to warm the dishes, an act which seems clearly both in its nature for which no practical purpose is seen, and through the assertion that thus the demons are destroyed, to have been a piece of magic. But the relations of the two fires are not in practice so simple as this: there are cases in which the functions are inverted. The third fire is the Dakṣiņägni, also called the Anvāhāryapacana because the sacrificial fee for the new and full moon sacri- fices, which was called Anvāhārya, was cooked on it. This fire was probably in its origin, as shown by its place at the south, intended to drive away by its flames the evil spirits and the souls of the dead, but it was natural that it should serve also for offerings to such spirits, though in the case of the Fathers pits were also used. We are expressly told that the fire served to avert danger from the Fathers, and in the rite of the royal consecration a brand is taken out of this fire, and used as the place for an offering to drive away evil spirits, and in the same rite another fire-brand is taken out and an offering made on it to Nirrti. The Dakṣiņāgni is also used both at the monthly offerings to the

Fathers, and at the annual offering connected with the Sākamedhas, the third of the four-month sacrifices of the Çrauta ritual.1 

The rules for the steps to be taken to set up the three fires or the house- holder's single fire are many and minute, but of little general importance: it is precisely in minutiae that the genius of the Brahmans shows itself to its complete extent, but, as in the case of the Roman priesthood, without gain to religious conceptions. The two normal methods are the old-fashioned one of producing the fire from the fire sticks, a process which is of immemorial antiquity in India,2 and the obtaining of the fire from the fire maintained by a great sacrificer or wealthy master of cattle, the chief kind of Vedic wealth in the first case the fire is new and pure, in the second it bears with it the associations of ceremony or of wealth or both. In the case of the house- hold fire it is often preferred to take it from the last fire tended by the house- holder as a Brahman student, thus doubtless preserving the continuity of his holiness, or in the alternative from the fire with which his marriage ceremonies were performed, and which therefore is a suitable fire for the continuance of the rites arising from his married state. But in the case of the four-month offerings, and the Soma sacrifice as at the animal offering, it is the practice to produce by friction a new fire and unite it with the Ahavaniya, in order doubtless to refresh it and make it strong. In this usage may be seen the remnant of an idea that the fire grows from time to time tired, and should annually be refreshed by being superseded by a new fire. The evidence for such a belief being really held in any strong way in the Vedic period is, how- ever, very weak: Hillebrandt's suggestions that once a year the fire was normally relit rests on combinations which are without any value. The chief occasion recognized by the ritual for the setting up of new fires was when it was found that the existing fires were not bringing good fortune to the offerer. For this occasion the rite of re-establishment, Punarådheya, was prescribed.

## 7. The Performers of the Sacrifice 

As we have seen, it is an essential part of the Vedic sacrifice that it is a sacrifice for an individual, the Yajamāna, or sacrificer, who provides the means for the sacrifice, and above all the rich rewards for the priests. The king is naturally the chief of sacrificers, for him alone such sacrifices as the royal consecration could be offered, but there are others, members of the royal house, high officers and soldiers among the Kṣatriyas, rich merchants or

In the actual rite he is as much as the priest made divine.

[Part III 

agriculturists, and also, we should certainly add, rich Brahmans themselves. After making all allowances for exaggeration, the gifts to the Brahmans must often have resulted in the accumulation by a Brahman of great wealth which would pass on to his son, and which in view of the conceptions of the Brahmans could certainly not be better spent than in the performance of sacrifice. But even in the case of the king, the sacrifice is for the prosperity of the king, and only incidentally for the prosperity of the realm and people: the prayer of the royal consecration shows this, and still more markedly the prayer of the horse sacrifice, which in effect is the real purpose of that sacrifice, and not a thank-offering or mere celebration of the success of the king: the Adhvaryu prays,1 In holiness may a Brahman be born, full of holy radiance. In the kingly power be born a prince, a hero, a bowman, piercing with shafts, a mighty warrior. May the cow be rich in milk, strong the draught ox, swift the steed, fruitful the woman, eloquent the youth. May a hero son be born to the sacrificer. May Parjanya grant rain at all time according to our desire. May the corn ripen'. The bulk of the people are not even mentioned, but their pursuits, agriculture and the care of cattle, are alluded to. 

2 

The position revealed by the ritual seems hardly to be natural: it would certainly be expected that there should be some recognition of the sacrifices of the tribe, and the scant traces of an Agni Sabhya and Avasathya, which are adduced by Hillebrandt as proving the existence of tribal sacrifices, are a poor substitute for the evidence which should be forthcoming. We cannot, however, doubt that the Vedic attitude to the clan is unnatural and is a sign of developed ritual, not of primitive relations. There is but one exception to the rule that the sacrifice is for an individual in the Sattras, 'sacrificial sessions', long sacrifices extending as much as and even over a year, in which the sacrificers are the whole body of Brahmans officiating, the performance of such sacrifices being only possible when all are Brahmans: in that case the rule is that the whole of the merit of the offering belongs to them all, while any evil done belongs to the one who does it. It is possible that we have the record here of an older period of family offerings, but it is far from certain that this is so, and it is not clear whether the Rigveda * really knows of such rites : if not they must be priestly inventions, as in many respects they most certainly are, representing the imaginations of a priesthood, which desired nothing better than to spend its time in the technique of a curious and complicated ritual. 

5

In so developed a condition of religious practice it is not surprising to find that the priests had already made themselves indispensable at the Çrauta offerings: the householder might perform many of the domestic services himself, if he preferred to do so, and the poor man must have been in this position, but the Çrauta sacrifices demanded a priest or often several priests.

The Performers of the Sacrifice 

291 

It is beyond doubt that in the time of the Rigveda the priesthood was normally hereditary we have no material for a history of the growth of the special connexion of the families mentioned in the Rigveda such as the Viśvămitras, Vasisthas, Atris, Bharadvājas, with the sacrifice: we may assume that at a period when the simpler relations of life prevailed, some family became associated with the ritual through the skill of one of its members or some possession of unusual powers, but that period lies far behind the Rigveda, especially if we believe as is quite possible that a priesthood arose in the Indo- European 1 period. But these families differ essentially in some respects from parallel institutions in other Indo-European lands, showing that the Indo- European idea of priesthood cannot have been highly developed. There is no trace among them of the characteristics of the sacred colleges of the Romans, like the Arval Brothers or the Salii, charged with the oversight of definite parts of the public sacrifices, for there were no public sacrifices. Nor again are they like the Greek families which had hereditary priesthoods, often recognized by the state as at Eleusis, for these again had definite gods or rites to care for, while the Vedic families in the main dealt with the same kinds of rites, the differences between families in the times of which we know being in detail rather than in general aspect. Doubtless the different families were originally marked out by much more serious differences in cult than those which we can verify the whole process of the relation of the Rigveda and of the ritual suggests syncretism on a large basis, but the possibility of the development of the distinct priesthoods of Greece and Rome was in all pro- bability hampered and finally prevented by the lack of the temple, and of the organization of public worship by the state. The state is a much more per- manent instrument than any private men or kings could be: the Vedic kingship was, it is certain, far from assured, by reason of foreign war and internal dissension, and the priests could not therefore gather as a standing priesthood around the royal house. Nor, to do them justice, do the priests seem to have desired to do so: the impression left by the Rigveda and the ritual alike is that priests were fond of wandering from place to place, per- forming rites for now this patron, and now that, a fact which probably explains how the innovations discovered from time to time by individuals had comparatively little chance of affecting seriously the main body of the ritual, which has come down to us in essentially the same shape, despite endless variation in unimportant minutiae. The radical changes, if any, perished with their inventors, or at best soon after.

Vedic Ritual 

[Part III 

One priest alone seems to have been definitely attached to the king, and less often to other rich persons of the warrior or the agricultural and trading classes, Kṣatriya or Vaiśya. This was the Purohita, praepositus, who was charged with the general control of the offerings to be performed in households, which were large enough to maintain a considerable body of priests, and to hire others for special rites. As a rule there can only have been one Purohita who probably acted as long as he and the king were alive and on good terms : we hear, however, of changes of Purohita, as that of Viśvāmitra for Vasiṣṭha, with the result of the effort of the rejected rival to overthrow the king by bringing a coalition of ten princes against him,1 and there is no Vedic evidence to show that the later practice, which made the priesthood hereditary in the family of the priest prevailed, though one Purohita in some cases at least evidently served more than one prince in succession, or even according to the later texts one man might be Purohita of as many as three allied kings at once." In this case, however, we may imagine that there were subordinate Puro- hitas also employed. The relation of king and Purohita was created by a very formal act in which the precise words of the wedding service were repeated,3 and there is abundant evidence that the Purohita was in religion and civil affairs the alter ego of the king. The law books 5 make him out to be the king's teacher in sacred and other learning, his councillor in the performance of all his duties, the dispenser of justice in the place of the king, and prone to inter- fere in royal successions: popular tales represent the evil Purohita as bringing to ruin the kingdom as the good preserves it, and the Rigveda already makes the prosperity of the whole realm depend on him. It may be taken as certain that he performed all the domestic ritual of the king's household, with its many formulae and magic rites to secure the success of the king's under- takings in war and peace, the correctness of his judgements, and the prosperity of his subjects: we see clearly from the Rigveda that the Purohita was expected to be in the battle to secure victory, not by arms, but by the weapons of his magic power; the Atharvaveda preserves a battle spell used by a Purohita in fight, and the Rigveda 1o tells how the Purohita Deväpi won rain by a spell. The Brāhmaṇas represent the gods defeated by the Asuras as rushing to Bṛhaspati, who is the divine Purohita, and asking him to devise a new rite to overcome the Asuras, which he very properly at once does.

the ancestor of the invoker, when a king is the sacrificer, the name of his Purohita's ancestor is used in place of his own: the Purohita must take part in offerings made to undo errors of the king in his capacity as criminal judge,1 and in the sacrifice of the horse certain libations must be offered, according to some authorities, in the house of the Purohita.2 

8 

From the Purohita must be distinguished the ordinary offering priest, and his relation to them may be assumed to have been that suggested by his name : he was the superintendent who took the care of the offerings, and saw that they were duly carried out. But it is obvious that he might, as a Brahman and as competent ex hypothesi to supervise every rite, undertake some part him- self, and we have every reason to think that he did so. In the case of Deväpi he was not only Purohita, but at the sacrifice performed by him as a rain spell he acted as the Hotṛ priest: similarly Agni is Purohita as well as Hotṛ priest, and the two divine Hotṛs who are invoked in the Apri litanies are also called the two Purohitas. That this was the older rule, seems suggested by the fact that the Hotṛ was clearly in the time of the composition of the poetry of the Rigveda the really important priest, and that the Purohita would naturally take his office, as it was taken in some cases by the sacrificer himself." With the growth of the ritual, however, and its increasing complication, a sure sign that the poetry was ceasing to be the main point of interest to the priest, it was only natural that the overseer of the sacrifice should become a priest different from the Hotṛ, namely the Brahman priest to whom in the ritual as opposed to the Rigveda the duty of caring for the sacrifice as a whole is assigned. Hence we find that the Brahmaņas assert that the Purohita is the Brahman priest, and that the Vasisthas as Purohitas and Brahmans are specially meritorious, while the divine Purohita, Bṛhaspati, becomes the Brahman priest of the god in the technical sense of the term. But even then the Purohita seems not to have been tied down to any one function: he could, if he preferred, act as a Săman singer.” 

6 

In the later literature after the Vedic period the figure of the Purohita retains in even increased force the importance which it has for the Veda. It is clear that in him we have the aggressive and active side of priestly interference in human affairs: the ordinary offering priest must be deemed in comparison to have been a technical priest, or scholar engaged in reflection, and the proud position asserted for priests generally never in fact was attained by them. The position of the Purohita therefore never essentially affected the priesthood as a whole, and it was made only possible by the existence when the practice developed of the hereditary priesthood and the belief that offerings required priestly intervention to be successful. The Purohita, therefore, is not to be

treated as more than an incidental factor in the growth of the caste system, and it must be remembered that in the time of the later literature the whole aspect of the priesthood was profoundly affected by the existence of temple worship with its apparatus of bodies of priests and the growth of traditional practices. 

Of the ordinary priest we have, as we have seen, a good many details in the Rigveda: specially often do we hear of seven Hotṛs, who presumably must correspond to the seven Seers whom the Rigveda 1 also mentions. This list may be given by detail in one passage of the Rigveda where Agni is identified with the Hotṛ, the Potṛ, the Nestṛ, the Agnidh, the Praśāstṛ, the Adhvaryu, and the Brahman as well as with the householder himself. The same list, save for the Upavaktṛ, who seems to be identical in essence with the Praśastṛ, appears as the list of priests to whom the Achāvāka, a later addition to the priesthood, addresses a request to be admitted to share the Soma.2 Another list, given in connexion with the morning pressing of the Soma, is slightly different it includes the Hotṛ, two Adhvaryus, two Praśāstṛs, Brahman, Potṛ, Neștṛ, and Agnidhra.3 The second Adhvaryu is evidently an addition : in the later period he is the Pratiprasthätṛ; the second Praśastṛ is similarly the Achāvāka in the later ritual. The list also agrees, in the main but not completely, with the list of priests, who have cups and altars in the Soma sacrifice. The old list is comparable with the eight of the Avesta,5 but the comparison is not in detail exact, and we may doubt whether we can safely assume more than a general similarity between the Indo-Iranian and the Vedic cult the exact degree of the development of the separation of functions is not to be determined with certainty. The Hotṛ is clearly the Zaotar, the Agnidh has the same duty as the Atarevakhša, and the Potṛ as the Asnatare, the washer of the Soma. But it is impossible to find the counterpart to the singers of the Vedic ritual. 

The Hotṛ must from his name have been originally at once the performer of the offering and the speaker of any words which accompanied it, but the distinction between the two portions of the functions of the Hotṛ must have developed quite early, perhaps even before the close of the Indo-Iranian period. In the Vedic ritual text-books a fundamental distinction is drawn between two kinds of offerings, which are called Yajatayas and Juhotayas respectively: in the former there is but one speaker and actor, who is, however, called Adhvaryu, not Hotṛ, from the more important side of his functions; in the latter there is, beside the Adhvaryu who performs the manual acts, the Hotr to recite. The extent of the function of the Hotṛ varies very greatly: in a large number of offerings the only verses which he has to repeat are the Puronuvākyā and the Yājyă. The first is a verse addressed to the god

inviting him to be present at the offering to be made to him; the latter is said just at the end when the Adhvaryu is about to throw the offering into the fire; after it the Hotṛ says the word Vauṣat, of doubtful sense and meaning,1 and thereafter often a brief formula addressed to the god bidding,him enjoy the offering, terminating with Vauṣat again, the whole phrase forming the 'secondary Vaṣaṭ' (anu-vaṣaṭkāra) which is constantly referred to in the sacrifice. The Yājyä verse is preceded by the word ye yajāmahe, and it is very possible that it is merely a development from it: but at least in the Rigveda there were series of such verses composed. The Puronuvākyās seem to have been later in development, though some may be seen in the Rigveda. In their place often are found longer recitations such as accompany the main offerings of the Soma: there is a peculiarity in the verses thus used which suggests that the ritual in its development still retained traces of its older form. In the hymns used are inserted Nivids, apparently also called Madas, which are invitations to the god with an enumeration of his titles to come and intoxi- cate himself with the Soma. These Nivids, as they are preserved to us, are of undoubtedly later composition than the hymns of the Rigveda, but it is perfectly reasonable to believe that in principle they represent the oldest form of the invitation to the gods.2 We may conceive a time when the Nivid and the mere formula ye yajämahe represented the whole of the words of the Hotṛ, but we have no clear ground on which to trace the precise development of the form of the ritual. The Adhvaryu in his turn has a certain number of formulae, normally in prose, to repeat as the several acts of the sacrifice proceed, in order to avert evil and invoke prosperity, but his main duty must have at first been, and even in the later ritual was, the management of the practical part of the offering, the preparation of the cakes and the straining and purifying of the Soma, the arranging of the many utensils, and the actual pouring of the offerings in the fire appropriate to each. In this work he had the constant aid of the Agnidh, whose name denotes him as specially concerned with the kindling of the fire. This priest with the Adhvaryu, the Hotṛ, and the Brah- man to oversee it all, managed many of the lesser offerings, and he was specially in these cases concerned with the keeping of fire burning, but naturally did much else beside. The position in which he stood to the Adhvaryu is neatly shown by the procedure, which was gone through before the Hotṛ said his Yājyä verse: he must be told to do so by the Adhvaryu, but before this takes place the Adhvaryu must address the Agnidh with the words, 'Om: make him hear', to which the Agnidh replies solemnly, 'Be it so. Let him hear'. The episode is deliciously significant of the absurdities of the developed ritual. The close union of the two priests is perhaps the explana- tion of the two Adhvaryus in the list of priests already mentioned, though in the later tradition the second was the Pratiprasthätṛ.

Vedic Ritual 

[Part III 

These priests sufficed for the new- and full-moon offerings, but for the animal offering the Hotṛ required an assistant, the priest called variously Upavaktṛ, Praśastṛ, and Maitrāvaruņa. The first two names indicate his chief activity in the ritual, the giving of directions, called Praișas,1 to the priests, and this function he already exercised in respect of the Hotṛ as early as the Rigveda. The ritual prescribes that he should give to the Hotṛ his Praisa for the recitation of the Yäjyä, standing before him on the right hand of the Hotṛ's seat, holding a staff, slightly bent forward. Moreover, at the animal sacrifice he shares the Hotṛ's duties, often, when there are verses to be recited, taking the one and the Hotṛ the other. In the case of the Soma sacrifice he has recitations of his own to perform, in large measure directed to Mitra and Varuna, from whom therefore he borrows his third name as (The priest) connected with Mitra and Varuna ', and, as the root whence comes the name Praśāstṛ, 'orderer', is an appropriate term for the commands of these gods, the human priest may have borrowed this designation from the gods themselves, though this is rather conjectural. What is much more certain is that the two divine Hotṛs, of whom we hear in the Rigveda, are the heavenly representatives of the Hotṛ and the Maitrāvaruņa. 

· 

In the Soma sacrifice lie the functions of the Potṛ and the Neṣṭr, who are included in the Rigveda list. The Potr is in the actual ritual a mere shadow, of no consequence or importance, whose former importance may be judged from his name and his obvious connexion with Soma Pavamana. The Neṣṭr is also in the later ritual a priest with but one function of any interest or importance. It occurs in the course of the Soma rite, when an offering is made to Agni with the wives of the gods. The Agnidh, who in this case has to par- take of the Soma, sits in the lap of the Nestr, and thereafter the Nestr summons the wife of the householder, who then performs with the Udgātṛ a rite which is a mimicry of cohabitation and whose nature as a fertility spell was as clearly recognized by the ritual texts as by us. The suggestion * that the rite is a barbarous one, and that the Nestṛ is an intrusion into the Vedic ritual from a non-Vedic source, is clearly an error, and ignores the fact that fertility magic is looked upon by primitive peoples with very different eyes from those of the present day. 

The remaining priest in the list of seven is the Brahman. It is uncertain exactly who is meant by this term, but the greatest probability is clearly that it is the Brāhmaṇācchansin of the later ritual, who is also addressed as Brah- man and whose older name was clearly Brahman. His duty in the later ritual is to be an assistant of the Hotṛ, and at the Soma sacrifice to recite a litany for Indra. The alternative view, that of Geldner," takes him to be

in the Rigveda already the priest charged with the whole of the supervision of the ritual, and it is possible, though not certain, that already in the Rigveda 1 in the latest parts such a priest was known. In the later ritual his place is one of the highest importance: he is set off against all the other priests as equal in value to the whole of the rest of them: he says very little, and is mainly engaged in supervision seated in the place of the Brahman near the chief fire altar, by his silent meditation repairing every flaw in the sacrifice. The later nature of the office is also reflected in the tradition that the Vasiṣṭhas alone were the owners of a certain litany, which has to be spoken by the Brahman at the offering: this points to the tradition of an invention in one family, which led in course of time to the gradual adoption of the use of such a priest by all the families. 

3 

In the list of seven there is no mention of the Hotṛ's counterparts, the Saman singers, but they are elsewhere mentioned in the Rigveda, and the names of the Udgătṛ and Prastotṛ are mentioned, so that the omission of the Pratihartṛ may be merely accidental. The songs of the Saman singers are of a really primitive kind,a in that they are made up with all sorts of meaning- less syllables interjected among the words, in order presumably to fit them to the music of the song: the comparison of the chant to the revival ceremonies of American negroes is too attractive to be disregarded. The chants fall into two classes, those addressed to Soma Pavamana, which are the chants that they must first have been expected to sing: they differ in form markedly from the ordinary hymns of the Rigveda, and are also differentiated by their position in book ix. In addition to these, however, they chant songs for the ordinary gods, to whom the libations are offered at the three pressings of the Soma: the ritual demands a precise parallelism, each recitation of the Hotṛ being preceded by a chant, and the chant and recitation being closely allied by the use in the chant of sets of verses of the recitation. The arrangement is artificial and not early, as the inaccuracies in the ritual' prove, and the absurdity of the theory of correspondence is proved by the case of the songs to Soma Pavamāna which have no real connexion at all with the recitations of the Hotṛ, to which they are alleged to be a parallel. 

The evidence clearly does not allow us to say whether the Saman singers were, or were not, present in the earliest form of the Soma sacrifice: the absence of their names from the Avestan list and the list of the seven Hotṛs might be cited in support of such a view, but at the same time the argument could not be pressed: the songs might easily have been chanted by some other priest-as by the Potṛ-before the Săman singers came into existence. 

The later ritual requires only the Adhvaryu for the Agnihotra offering performed daily; for the piling or establishing of the fire, Agnyādheya, four

priests, Hotṛ, Adhvaryu, Agnidhra, and Brahman; for the four-month offerings also the Pratiprasthätṛ; and for the animal sacrifice the Maitrāvaruņa and Çamitṛs as aiders of the Adhvaryu. For the Soma sacrifice it prescribes sixteen, who are arranged as Hotṛ, Maiträvaruṇa, Achāvāka, and Grāvastu Adhvaryu, Pratiprasthätṛ, Nestr, and Unnetṛ; Udgātṛ, Prastotr, Pratihari, and Subrahmanya; and Brahman, Brāhmaṇacchansin, Potṛ, and Agnidhra. The whole arrangement is, however, artificial and worthless: the three assistants of the Brahman and the Neṣtṛ in practice are reckoned rather with the Hotṛ, and the aim at sets of four has spoiled the natural order. The Kauṣitakins curiously enough had seventeen priests, a view not approved by the other schools, which naturally saw no need for a priest who was merely to sit in the Sadas at the sacrifice,2 a function clearly sufficiently provided for by the Brahman who had nothing else to do. 

In this ritual we find the fully developed form of what is already known to the Rigveda, the choosing of the priests by the offerer, who must satisfy him- self as to their capacities, if for no other reason than that, while he attains the fruit of the sacrifice, all the errors of the priests fall upon him, so that they can if they like ruin him at any moment by making deliberate blunders, as the Brāhmaṇas tell them how to do if they so wish. In their turn they are entitled to ask the sacrificer questions and to make sure that he is a proper person to sacrifice for, and that other priests have not already been engaged in the offering and left it unfinished by reason of disagreement with the sacrificer. The point is of interest, as illustrating how firmly organized the Brahmans were on the best trade-union models. The sacrificer must be of the three highest castes; exceptions are of the rarest character, and mainly concern the makers of chariots, Rathakāras, who seem to have occupied at quite an early date a peculiar position, not included in the third caste but still distinctly superior to the Çūdras, a fact which suggests that they were of inferior origin to the three castes, but by skill too important and useful to be neglected.3 

5 

The evidence, however, is somewhat confusing. We find in Apastamba a form of words prescribed at the new- and full-moon offering in the case of a Çudra, where it seems that we are expected to see in the Çüdra either a Rathakāra or a Niṣāda, two special classes permitted a share in the sacrifice. A Çüdra appears also at the Pitṛmedha in the Çatapatha Brāhmaṇa, and it is permitted to eat food from a carpenter (takṣan), who, of course, is closely allied to the Rathakāra. Aśvalayana⚫ permits the carpenter to establish the sacred fire, and Bharadvāja expressly says that some permit this to the fourth caste, while others do not. The later theory makes the Rathakāra to

be the son of a Vaiśya by a Çūdra mother. On the other hand Apastamba 1 expressly contemplates any of the first three classes including in its ranks Rathakaras, which certainly seems an artificial view, in view of the compara- tively late period of that Sutra. The Niṣădas who appear occasionally as per- mitted to have some concern in the sacrifice are reckoned by the ancient authority Aupamanyava as a fifth class, and they have some claim to be regarded as members of the pre-Aryan population who remained in a less dependent condition than the Çudras, presumably retaining their own tribal organization under the suzerainty of Aryan princes.2 

In the later ritual the chief duties of the sacrificer himself were of an inferior type: he had certain formulae to repeat, he might perform the manual throwing of the offering in the fire, and he had various restrictions to undergo: his wife was in the same position, but her part in the rite was rather smaller than her husband's: she was, however, clearly considered throughout to be concerned in the sacrifice, and a formal place is provided for her at the Soma sacrifice and still more clear is her participation in other offerings. The sacrificer had, however, the most important duty of dividing the sacrificial fees, or Dakṣiņās, so called either from the literal fact that the gifts, usually of cows, were placed on the right side for the sacrificer to divide, or because the word Dakṣiņā from its literal sense had come to mean acceptable. This duty is prescribed in precise terms with regard to the several offerings, and there is often an obvious attempt to make the reward fit the service which has taken place in respect of the nature of the gifts given, e.g. a black beast for an offering for the dead. It must remain doubtful to what extent we may not see in the Dakṣinäs the alteration of the older practice of offering the things given at the sacrifice: the priests determined to keep them, and converted the sacri- fice into gifts to themselves. 

4 

Of the additional priests at the Soma sacrifice none have much importance or interest: the Subrahmanya was introduced because of a particular formula only, with which has been compared the Bahram Yašt of the Avesta, and the Achāvāka is of special interest only because he is so obviously an introduction when the ritual was well defined, as is practically admitted in the Brahmanas and in the ritual itself."
