The power of the word is very marked in all systems of magic and naturally not least in India. The magic spell is sometimes in prose, in the style of the formulae used by the Adhvaryus at the sacrifice, more often in verse, sometimes newly made for the purpose, sometimes, and indeed very often, chosen without any appropriateness from the vast body of existing sacred literature. Of this latter tendency two examples may be given the number available is legion. The finest hymn to Varuna in the Vedic literature is found in the Atharvaveda where it has been preserved in a charm.5 The great hymn of the Rigveda, which celebrates the god Prajapati in the form of questions, has the second verse used in a spell for preventing the miscarriage of a cow, doubtless for no better reason than that the idiotic system on which names of authors were assigned to every hymn of the collection resulted in postulating an author Hiranyagarbha, he of the golden womb', really an epithet of the supreme god, and the fact that the deity was Prajapati." 

Of the spell one characteristic is the regularity with which many gods are invoked it is absurd to suppose that in these enumerations there was normally any sense of the different deities invoked all that was desired was 

to strengthen the spell by the utterance of as many names of deities as possible in some cases the mention of individuals is dropped and merely the numbers are given, 99 or 88 or 77 and so on: the fondness for such numbers

is a feature of many forms of magic.1 Analogous to this feature is the fact that when anything is to be dealt with every conceivable place where it may be is enumerated: a disease is banished, not merely from the place where it is paining the person afflicted, but from all his members. On the other hand, where possible the exact name and origin of the thing dealt with must be given if one can name father and mother so much the better: the drum 2 is described as coming from the lord of the forest and strung by the cows. Sometimes names of, to us, inexplicable and perhaps esoteric character are given, such as hrudu applied in the Atharvaveda to fever, in accordance with the well-known rule that in magic a mysterious name is the most potent of all.4

A second characteristic of the spells is the stress laid on the recital of comparisons which have magic effect in producing the results desired. The kidneys are made to settle themselves firmly by comparison with the mountains which abide for ever, or the bird which is at rest in its nest, or the cows which have come back to the stall.5 The amulet is made effective by the fact that it was the one bound by the Dākṣāyaṇas on Śatānika. The dying round the Brahman, which is prescribed in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa as the spell par excellence of the Purohita against the foes of his master, is accompanied by comparison with the mode in which the constellations appear and set again. The birth of the embryo is encouraged by the comparison with the wind which moves the lotus pond on all sides, and so on indefinitely. The use of the word 'grow' is necessary when the Arundhati plant is addressed in order to heal a broken bone below', 'away', are used when a disease is expelled: if one practises witchcraft, one should use the word 'broken' when offering a cup in bringing about harmony the word in unison' is of value. The importance of the name has already been mentioned: it results in the giving to each child of a secret name. Nor is there missing the rite by which a formula is repeated backwards: if the offering priest is interrupted by the servants of the sacrificer, he should repeat backwards the DaŚahotṛ formula, and thus bring the sacrifice to ruin." The use of harsh words like phat, &c., is mentioned possibly even as early as the Rigveda.10 

The word has special force in the form of the curse, which is often recorded in Vedic literature and which as is well known is one of the most common motives in later Indian literature. Fish are killed out of hand by men, because they betrayed to the gods Agni when he fled for shelter to the waters and for that deed Agni cursed them to be slain by men.11 The trees which

caused illness to the gods were cursed by the gods to be destroyed by a handle of the woodman's axe, made from their own bodies. The curse is often mentioned as being invoked to recoil on the curser himself, showing that it was a common form of magic attack. It might also be heightened in effect by a formal offering, in which the rules of the sacrifice are violated and the points of reeds are sacrificed to the accompaniment of formulae declaring that the sacrificer takes from the enemy, who has played him false with his wife, hope and sight, children and cattle, breathing in and breathing out. The curse 

2 in the Brahmanas is constantly expressed in a curious form if a man performs an act in the offering incorrectly, then he places himself in such a position that, if any one were to say of or to him something unpleasant, that would come true. The point is clear: the mistake exposes the man guilty of it to the risk of the effective working of any curse which is invoked upon him.

The Vedic oath is often recorded: the king at the great consecration recorded by the Aitareya Brahmana must swear to his priest to be true, at the cost otherwise of all his merit in sacrifice and gifts to the priests since the beginning of his life, his good deeds, his offspring, passing from him on the occasion of his falsehood. But a still older form of oath recorded 5 is by cows, or waters, or Varuna, and the Indian to this day swears in some cases by Ganges water which he holds in his hand. The legal literature allows oaths for a Brahman by his truth, for a Kṣatriya by his teams and weapons, and for a VaiŚya by his cows, grain and gold, but these are not recorded for the Vedic period, and the first is modern in appearance as compared with the Vedic oaths. Later, too, we find that the touching of oneself in the oath was not rare, as showing the spirits the person to be punished if the oath were not kept : this usage is proved for late Vedic times by the provision that the touch in such a case is, like the offering to Rudra, a ground for purification by means of water.8 Possibly, too, the curses recorded that a man's head shall fly off, which is paralleled by the Buddhist malediction that the head should split in seven pieces, may be connected with this idea of touching the head. A joint curse is that of the Tānūnaptra rite, which is an oath of fidelity of the priest and the sacrificer in the Soma sacrifice, with a curse on the violator of the oath. There is in the Aitareya Brahmana 10 an echo of the famous story of the lotus theft, in which the various persons accused of stealing the lotus fibres declared themselves guiltless by the device of invoking the most dreadful

This form is clearly religious and there is 

no ground to claim magic as a more primitive source of the oath, both kinds

misfortunes on the head of the thief, while the true thief, the god himself, revealed his nature by invoking nothing but good. (The classical instance of a broken oath is that of Soma, who is punished for falling to keep his promise to dwell with the twenty-seven wives whom he received from Prajapati, by the disease Rajayakṣma, perhaps consumption.1
