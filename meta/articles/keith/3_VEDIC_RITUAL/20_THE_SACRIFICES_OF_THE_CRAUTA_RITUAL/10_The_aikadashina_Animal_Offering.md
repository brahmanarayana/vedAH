[Part III 

for the one victim there prescribed. In that case the ceremony is lengthened by the performance for each of the victims of the formal rite of the slaying, &c.: the general parts, such as the fore-offerings, are not repeated for each. Thirteen posts are used in place of one: the twelfth, the UpaŚaya, is not set up, and the thirteenth is reserved under the name of Patnivata for an offering at the end of the ceremony. The middlemost post is placed near the fire, then one on either side, the rule being that the height increases from north to south: the UpaŚaya is bound round with two cords, and placed at the southern post with maledictions on an enemy. To the centre post is tied the victim for Agni, north to it the sheep for Sarasvati, south the goat for Soma, and so on, ending with the victim for Varuna on the south: mentally a beast of the wild, such as a mole, is attributed to the UpaŚaya. After the offering of the omentum of the Anubandhya cow, preparations are made for an offering of a victim to Tvaştr at the Patnivata post, but the victim, which must be reddish brown, after the carrying round of fire is allowed to go free, being replaced by butter, with the offering of which the rite ends, unless it is stopped sooner at the carrying round of the fire.
