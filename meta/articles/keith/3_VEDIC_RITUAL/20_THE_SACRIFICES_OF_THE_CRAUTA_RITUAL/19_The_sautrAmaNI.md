The Sautrāmaṇi 6 is not a Soma sacrifice, but is classified by the Sutras as a Haviryajña, though its chief characteristic in its form as recorded is the offering of Sura. It has two distinct forms, the Kaukili, which is an independent offering, the other the Caraka, an offering which forms part of another 

This is clearly the wedding of sun and earth, a form of that of sky and earth; cf. Brunnhofer, Arische Urzeit, pp. 325- 7; Cook, Zeus, i. 526 ff., 604, 672, 709, 733. 

* Other Ayanas (e. g. Utsargiṇām Ayana, JB. iii. 898-7; TS. vii. 5. 6 f.; KS. xxx. 7; PB. v. 10) are given in the Brāhmaṇas and Sutras.

offering, as the Rājasūya and the Agnicayana. It is prescribed for various occasions, but the characteristic ones are the rites for a man who is vomiting Soma, or from whose nose, ears, &c., Soma flows as a result of over-indulgence in the drink. The Caraka form seems clearly a reference to the school of the Black Yajurveda, which is often so named: the view of Hillebrandt 1 that it alludes to the medical teacher Caraka, in whose school Sura was used as medicine, is improbable and unsupported by any evidence. The differences between the two forms are of detail: thus the Kaukili is marked by the singing by the Brahman of certain Samans. The use of the Sura is accompanied by offerings of animals, to Indra a bull, to Sarasvati a sheep, and to the AŚvins a goat. These are offered on the fourth day of the rite, which is modelled on the fourth-day Soma sacrifice, along with oblations of milk, of Sura, and of animal fat. The goat for Agni and Soma, which in the Soma sacrifice precedes the pressing day, is replaced by a bull for Agni, and the barren cow at the end of the Soma rite is replaced by a bull for Indra Vayodhas. In the Surā, which is prepared from various kinds of herbs in a wonderful way, are mixed hairs 2 of a lion, a tiger, and a wolf, to confer corresponding characteristics on the partakers of the cups of Sura. The Fathers also receive an offering of the Sura. After the libation to Vanaspati in the animal offering, a throne of Muñja grass is set down between the two Vedis, which, as at the Varuṇapraghasas, are used in this rite, and on this the sacrificer sits down with silver under his left and gold under his right foot: the offerings, thirtytwo in number, of fat are then made, while the remainder is used to sprinkle the sacrificer, so that it flows from his mouth. The Adhvaryu then touches the sacrificer, who calls on his servants with their ritual names, and they lift him up first knee high, then navel high, and then as high as the mouth. He then steps on to a tiger-skin as establishing himself in the lordship: the thirtythird cup of fat is offered, a Saman is sung, and all join in the finale. A milk offering to Mitra and Varuna, and a bull for Indra Vayodhas conclude the rite. It is conjectured by Hillebrandt that the rite was taken over by the Indians from a non-Brahmanical tribe, and then remodelled on the basis of the Soma ritual he thinks that the Sura was once a drink akin to the Madhu, and offered to the AŚvins. The AŚvins are not prominent as Soma-drinkers, but they certainly are connected with the Madhu, and the Surā seems from the evidence of the Avesta to have been once a sacred and honoured drink. The Madhu or Surā cult, he thinks, may have flourished on the banks of the Sarasvati, where the Vasisthas show little anxiety about the Soma cult, and may not originally have practised it, but have learned it from later intruders.

hypothesis, however, is not supported by any evidence of value,1 and there are clear traces that the rite was based on myth, that of the effects on Indra of over-indulgence in Soma and the resulting illness which was cured by the efforts of the AŚvins and Sarasvati, a fact alluded to in the Rigveda.
