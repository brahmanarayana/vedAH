      <description>THE rites of the Śrauta ritual have much essentially in common, in addition to the necessity of the use of the three or one at least of the three fires in place of the domestic fire. They necessitate the presence of priests numbering from one up to sixteen, or with the Kauṣitakins seventeen,1 to whom should be added the actual performers of some of the minor actions in the more complicated forms of the ritual, whose number is not defined, and whose menial functions rendered them of no consequence in the eyes of the priests of the higher rank.</description>

      <description>The ritual texts lay down various periods as appropriate for the setting up of the sacred fires, the spring is the scason for a Brahman, the summer for a Kṣatriya, the rainy season for a Rathakara, and the autumn for a VaiŚya, or the cool season is suited for all castes. They also suggest that the proper time is the new moon, especially in conjunction with certain asterisms, but the full moon is also permissible.</description>

      <description>It is the duty of the man who has established his fires, as of the man who has no fires, to offer daily, morning and evening, the Agnihotra: 2 the precise time of offering, whether just before or just after the rising of the sun in the morning, and whether after sunset or after the appearance of the first star in the evening, is a subject of much discussion in the Brahmanas and Sūtras.</description>

      <description>These sacrifices 1 are of special value as they form the model for all sacrifices of the type called Iṣti, which include an enormous number of offerings for special ends; in all these cases the sacrifice is assumed to be performed precisely as in the newand full-moon offerings, but with the distinction that some special rite is inserted in the place of the essential features of these offerings, which are at the full-moon offering a cake for Agni and Soma, and at the newmoon offering a cake for Agni and Indra.</description>

      <description>3
The three four-month offerings are connected intimately with the seasons of the year, the VaiŚvadeva being offered in spring, the Varunapraghāsas in the rains, and the Sākamedhas in the autumn, at the beginning of each season. The connexion with the seasons is shown by the formulae, the names of the months which are connected with certain libations, and the formal cutting of the hair which is connected with certain of the rites.</description>

      <description>Before partaking of any of the fruits of the fields it is necessary for a man who has established the fires to make offerings. The normal offerings are those of rice in autumn, and barley in spring: alternatives are bamboo seeds in summer, and millet in autumn or the rains in these two cases Soma is the god to whom the offerings are made: in the other case Indra and Agni receive a cake of the new fruits, and the All-gods and heaven and earth also have offerings.</description>

      <description>According to the Sutras we must distinguish between the animal sacrifice as an independent offering and the sacrifice as connected with the Soma sacrifice the offering of a goat to Agni and Soma in that offering is often treated as the Prakṛti of all animal sacrifices, but in some cases the independent animal offering which is called the NirudhapaŚubandha takes the place of the Agniṣomiya. The rite is to be performed by any man who establishes the fires, before he eats meat, and then yearly or half yearly, in which case the beginning of the bright course of the sun and the end of that period are prescribed by some authorities.</description>

      <description>3
The model form of the Soma sacrifice may be said to be the Agnistoma, which is the simplest form of the one-day Soma sacrifice, that is an offering on which the Soma is offered on one day only, in the morning, at midday, and
1 Above, Part III, Chap. 18, § 6. * Ibid., § 5. Hubert and Mauss (Année
sociol. ii. 81, 82) indeed compare the invocation and consumption of the Iḍā to the Mass and transubstantiation; but this is clearly a grave exaggeration.</description>

      <description>In the Soma sacrifice the Pravargya is inserted by the ritual text-books as an element which is to be performed twice a day in the course of the Upasad days, giving, with the normal three Upasads, six performances. But there is great doubt as to whether the rite is necessary, or whether it should be performed also at the first Agnistoma, or not until after one has been performed. The discrepancy of opinion suggests that the rite was originally a separate sacrifice altogether, and this is borne out by the Rigveda, where it seems to have been an offering made in the morning only.</description>

      <description>The ritual texts rank the Agniṣṭoma as the first form of the series of Soma sacrifices which bear the generic title of Jyotiṣṭoma. The list is in their view the Atyagnistoma, the Ukthya, the SodaŚin, the Vajapeya, Atiratra, and Aptoryama or Aptoryama. The number of the series is seven, and it is most probable that the number is simply the sacred seven, and not a trace of an original view. The Atyagniṣṭoma, the Vajapeya, and the Aptoryāma have not the place of forms of the Jyotisṭoma in the older Samhitas, and probably were added to make up the number to seven.</description>

      <description>3
The Agniṣṭoma is the model on which innumerable other kinds of sacrifice can be formed, in order to bring about certain desires. The Vicvajit is occasionally mentioned in it a man gives all his goods as the fee, or at least a thousand cattle and hundred horses. In the former case he first hands over to his eldest son his share in the property. After the offering he spends twelve nights in different places, three where an Udumbara is, eating fruits and roots only, three among Niṣādas, without eating the grains cultivated by them, three with folk, and three with folk like himself, or according to another view either VaiŚyas or Rajany&amp;hellip; The symbolic nature of the rite is obvious.</description>

      <description>The Vajapeya is of especial interest in that it preserves, despite the formalism imposed upon it by its inclusion in the Soma ritual, many traces of very popular origin. It is said by many authorities to be a festival of the autumn, and it is also allowed either to perform it independently, or as the sixth day of a Sarvamedha or universal sacrifice. It consists of one pressing day and at least 18 days of consecration and three Upasad days, so that it takes up at least 17 days and may be spun out to a year.</description>

The royal consecration is a Soma sacrifice having the usual Dikṣā and Upasad days and preceded by a long series of preparatory rites. It is mythically connected with the consecration of Varuna or with Indra, and it

      <description>The horse sacrifice is in the ritual reckoned an Ahina, that is a rite with more than one day on which the Soma is pressed, in this case three. It is an old and famous rite, which kings alone can bring, to increase their realms: we have lists of the great kings of old 5 who were consecrated and who performed the horse sacrifice. The horse chosen must be swift, in front black, behind white, and with a dark mark.</description>

      <description>The human sacrifice as prescribed in two of the ritual texts 2 is based closely on the horse sacrifice; while there the chief victims are the horse, a Gomṛga, and a hornless goat, here a man is added, a Brahman or Kṣatriya bought at the price of a thousand cows and a hundred cattle, and he is permitted like the horse a year of freedom, in which he can do as he wishes, save that he must remain chaste.</description>

      <description>While the human sacrifice occupies five pressing days, the universal sacrifice, Sarvamedha,3 takes ten, and it is modelled on the offering made of himself by Brahman Svayambhu, in the beginning of things. Its relation to the human sacrifice is held to be the perfection of the former at the human sacrifice, according to Śañkhāyana, the offerer gives away the kingdom with the people at this he gives the earth away also, and in Hillebrandt&amp;rsquo;s view the rite marked the act by which the king left the royal life for the ascetic, as the Buddha afterwards did.</description>

      <description>8
The rite of twelve days, DvadaŚaha, may be performed either as an Ahina or a Sattra, and all rites with more than twelve pressing days are Sattras the number of years they may be continued extends to thirty-six or more up to 1,000. The Sattras all differ from other forms of the Soma sacrifice, because all the performers must be consecrated and must be Brahmans there is therefore no separate sacrificer: all share in the benefits of the offering each bears the burden of his own errors, whereas at the ordinary sacrifice the sacrificer receives the benefit and the evil results of errors alike.</description>

      <description>The Sautrāmaṇi 6 is not a Soma sacrifice, but is classified by the Sutras as a Haviryajña, though its chief characteristic in its form as recorded is the offering of Sura. It has two distinct forms, the Kaukili, which is an independent offering, the other the Caraka, an offering which forms part of another

      <description>The piling of the fire altar is a rite which is regarded as being always available for performance along with the Soma sacrifice, but which is declared to be obligatory only in certain cases, including the Mahāvrata, and even that view is far from being universally prescribed. There can be no doubt that it was by no means a normal or frequent rite: its elaboration is such that no ordinary sacrificer would trouble himself with it, and it must have been only occasionally used.</description>

      <description>The ritual requires in many places the use of the Hotṛ formulae, which are formulae in which the priests are mentioned as being identical with deities and other objects, the formulae being distinguished according to the number of priests so mentioned as Caturhotṛ, Pañcahotṛ, and so on. They are termed offerings, because they represent various sacrifices from the Agnihotra to the Soma offering inclusive. They are often used in the course of important rites, in which case they are normally assigned to the sacrificer, but also they can be employed independently, either by themselves or with the accompaniment of cups of some offering and the cry Svaha.</description>

      <description>In the intolerable complications of the Vedic sacrifice, coupled with the tendency to inaccuracy of the Indian mind of the Vedic period, may be found ample excuse for the number of prescriptions which are laid down for the purpose of expiating errors in the sacrifice. In some cases the expiations are elaborate in the extreme in most they are fairly simple. Of the former the most notorious case is that of the Kuṣmaṇḍa, which serves as a means of purification from grave sins, and which is dealt with in detail in the Taittiriya Aranyaka, whereas most of the other expiations are confined to the Sutras or to the later portions of the Brahmaṇas.</description>
