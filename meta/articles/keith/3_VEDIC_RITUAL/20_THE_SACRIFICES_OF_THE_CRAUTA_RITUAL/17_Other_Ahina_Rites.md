While the human sacrifice occupies five pressing days, the universal sacrifice, Sarvamedha,3 takes ten, and it is modelled on the offering made of himself by Brahman Svayambhu, in the beginning of things. Its relation to the human sacrifice is held to be the perfection of the former at the human sacrifice, according to Śañkhāyana, the offerer gives away the kingdom with the people at this he gives the earth away also, and in Hillebrandt's view the rite marked the act by which the king left the royal life for the ascetic, as the Buddha afterwards did. It is, however, difficult to take the offering seriously it is based on myth, and seems no more than a purely priestly fiction this is borne out by the fact that it is mentioned only in the latest Sutras, though it figures in the legend of Naciketas. 

There are many other forms of the Ahina rite, with more than one and not more than twelve pressing days, making up at most with the Upasads, &c., not over a month. The number of variations is very large indeed, and the different forms are given names, according to the families or individuals who invented or practised them. Of their make-up the most important rule is that they must end with an Atiratra rite, and in all the days of the Abhiplava and Pṛṣṭhya Sadahas are usually brought into account of these further particulars will be given below.

The fire in his house must be kept burning: no one, save a friend to give him the directions to perform his functions, must accompany him: he must say little and keep close. On the morning of the twelfth day he offers a libation of honey and sour milk with a formula addressed to Śabali. Before the voices of beings are heard, he goes from the village to a wood where he can hear none of the sounds of the village animals, takes a bunch of grass and cries thrice with loud voice' Śabali': if any animal other than a dog or an ass replies, his sacrifice will be successful.
