THE rites of the Śrauta ritual have much essentially in common, in addition to the necessity of the use of the three or one at least of the three fires in place of the domestic fire. They necessitate the presence of priests numbering from one up to sixteen, or with the Kauṣitakins seventeen,1 to whom should be added the actual performers of some of the minor actions in the more compli- cated forms of the ritual, whose number is not defined, and whose menial functions rendered them of no consequence in the eyes of the priests of the higher rank. It is obvious, for instance, that in the slaughtering of the victims there must often have been need for other aid than that of the Adhvaryu and his assistants proper, and the Śamitṛs are occasionally referred to as charged with the actual slaying: more often a general term like servant is used to apply to such helpers. 

As a result of the constant development of the ritual, the festivals of the Śrauta type are full of details which are of no consequence with regard to the meaning of the sacrifice: practically in no case is an important rite addressed to one god only: the effort on the contrary was clearly to find as much room as possible for as many gods as possible. We find, too, many variations among the details of the rites, of which but a few can be reduced to any simple principle. Thus we know that some families like the Jamadagnis and the Bhṛgus made five divisions or layers of the offerings, while other families a made but four, whence the former are called pañcavattins, and the latter caturavattins. Another distinction which has more religious value is the differences between families based on the distinction of the use of Tanünapät or NarāŚansa, as one of the deities invoked at the Apri litanies of the animal sacrifice, while the difference of dressing the hair is also of interest from the point of view of social usages, having many parallels in other lands.

In the Sutras the principle is laid down that the sacrifices are to be dis- tinguished as Prakṛtis and Vikṛtis, the former being the base on which the later are built up; thus the new- and full-moon sacrifices are the model for other sacrifices of the type known as Ișți, and for the animal sacrifice, in its form as an offering to Agni and Soma, on which further animal offerings are based. The Agnistoma again is the fundamental form of the Soma sacrifice:

on it are based other performances up to the DvadaŚãha inclusive, while on the latter are based the Sattras. Each sacrifice is divided into Pradhānas, the characteristics which mark it out as a special offering, and Añgas, the auxiliary parts which are common to many sacrifices, and which build the framework, Tantra, which serves to maintain the sacrifice. The distinction between the Yajatayas and the Juhotayas, the latter managed by the Adhvaryu alone and accompanied by the mere utterance of the word Svähä, hail',1 has already been noted.

In the Soma offering there is added the complications of the recitation of the Samans. The rule is that the Săman is a melody, which is performed on a verse of the Rigveda, and the verses can be sung to different melodies, for which purpose they have to be eked out by the addition of letters, or even of whole syllables, which have themselves no meaning, and of which as many as fifteen are enumerated.2 The nature of the tunes must have been varied in the extreme, to judge from the many names recorded, of which the Bṛhat and the Rathantara are the most notorious, but the nature of Indian music is an unsolved problem, and perhaps insoluble.3 Seven notes are mentioned, but their significance is much disputed. Each Saman is divided into parts, the most usual being that into Prastava, introduced by the word hum (huñkāra), sung by the Prastotr, the Udgitha, introduced by om, sung by the Udgatṛ, the Pratihāra, introduced by hum, sung by the Pratihartṛ, and the Nidhana, or finale, sung by all together. In some cases the Pratihāra is divided into two parts, the latter, the Upadrava, being sung by the Udgatṛ, or the Hiñkāra is made into a separate element. Moreover there are Upagātṛs, three in number, who accompany the song with the word ho. The contempt which through the Indian literature is more or less clearly shown for Saman singers is justified by the extraordinary stupidity of the position assigned to them. 

The singing of more than one verse on a tune is a Stotra, which usually is made up of a triplet or a Pragatha, a double verse, which is made into three for recitation purposes. From the Stotras are built up the Stomas, or forms of chanting Stotras. Of these there are many varieties. The simplest in some ways is the Trivṛt, which is the first used in the Agnistoma: it consists of nine verses, which can be variously arranged in sets of three, either as adg, beh, cfi, which is the Udyati form, or abc, def, ghi, the Parivartini, and abc, efd, igh, the Kulayini. On the other hand the other Stomas, the PañcadaŚa, SaptadaŚa, EkavinŚa, which with the Trivṛt are the main Stomas of the Agniṣṭoma, and others such as the PañcavinŚa, Trinava, TrayastrinŚa, CaturvinŚa, CatuŚcat- vārinŚa, and AṣṭācatvārinŚa, are all based on three verses or a Pragatha made into three. The numbers of the Stomas are derived from the number of verses which are used: thus the PañcadaŚa in one form is made up of aaabc, abbbc,

and abccc, the Hiñkāra being said before each set of three similar verses. Further complications will be noted later on. 

Before the Stotras can be performed the singers must obtain the approval of the Brahman and the Maiträvaruņa, who give it with the words om stuta, the Brahman saying also one of the Stomabhāgas, certain formulae provided for the purpose. The Stotra is followed by a Śastra, a recitation of the Hotṛ or his fellows, the signal for it being given by the performer of the Stotra saying eșă, 'this is the last verse.' The Hotṛ asks the Adhvaryu if he is to recite, the latter agrees. But at the morning litany in front of this dialogue are placed certain syllables, and a muttered prayer to MatariŚvan and the Kavis. This is followed by the silent praise, Tüṣṇīmjapa, and by the Puroruc, 'that which shines before', but in the midday and evening Śastras the place of the Puroruc is taken by Nivids, which are inserted in the hymns of the Śastra. The Nivids are introduced by the procedure of asking the Adhvaryu's authority to recite, but this formality is omitted in the case of the Puroruc at the first Śastra in the morning: at the second Śastra, on the other hand, we find seven Purorucs preceded by the dialogue of Hotṛ and Adhvaryu, and followed by a triplet. In the case of the midday Śastras there are further complications. In the first Śastra of the midday.and the evening pressings there are found sets of three verses called Pratipad and Anucara, which are preceded by the usual dialogue; then comes in the case of the midday Śastra, the Maruta Śastra, a Pragatha addressed to Indra, which is recited as three verses, the last part of each verse being repeated with the first of the next: thus the Pragatha, which consists of a Bṛhati1 and Satobṛhati 2 or Kakubh and Satobṛhati, is made into a Bṛhati and two Kakubh verses. This is followed by a Pragatha for Bṛhaspati, Dhayyās, supplementary verses, a Pragatha for the Maruts, the hymn in which the Nivid is inserted, the Ukthavirya formula, and then as in the other Śastras come the offering verse and the libation. In the case of the second Śastra of the midday and evening pressings, and all the Śastras of the assistants of the Hotṛ, the Hotrakas, the same sort of beginning is prescribed, but the verses are called Stotriya and Anurupa, names which refer to the fact that they follow the strophe and antistrophe of the corresponding Stotra of the Saman singers, which obey the rule that the Anurupa, corresponding verse', should follow the Stotriya in metre, number of syllables, and deity. As usual the rule is obeyed that the two verses of the Stotriya are made into three in recitation, and so with the Anurupa. Then in the second Śastra of the midday pressing, the Niskevalya, come Dhāyyās, a Sāmapragatha, the hymn with the Nivid, the Ukthavirya and the offering verse with the libation.

In the first Śastra of the evening pressing, the VaiŚvadeva, the Pratipad and Anucara are followed by a hymn with a Nivid, then a verse for Vayu, then a hymn with a Nivid to sky and earth, a hymn with a Nivid for the

Ṛbhus, three isolated verses, and a hymn with a Nivid to the All-gods. The second, the Agnimāruta, is composed of a hymn with a Nivid to VaiŚvānara, a Dhayya, a hymn with a Nivid to the Maruts, the Stotriya and Anurupa made from Pragathas, a hymn with a Nivid to Jatavedas, and a mass of miscellaneous stanzas addressed to the waters, &c. The other Śastras are less important the specimens given indicate the confusion and elaboration of ideas.

In other cases there takes place an elaborate process of intermingling both verses and parts of verses of different strophes with one another. This is the rule with the recitation of the Välakhilya hymns, which may be treated in two different but both complicated ways,1 with the Mahānāmni verses, with the verse for the Apyāyana or swelling out of the dry Soma stems, and so forth. It is only worth noting that as early as the Rigveda these puerilities seem to have been in vogue. 

The most important division of the sacrifices is that between the Soma offerings and the offerings which are sometimes classed as Haviryajñas, and which differ essentially from the Soma sacrifice as they do not employ the Saman singers. With the latter may be classed the animal sacrifice, but it also forms an integral and important part of the Soma offering.
