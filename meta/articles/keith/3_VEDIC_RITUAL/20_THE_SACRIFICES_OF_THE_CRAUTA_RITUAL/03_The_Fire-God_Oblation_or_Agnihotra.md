It is the duty of the man who has established his fires, as of the man who has no fires, to offer daily, morning and evening, the Agnihotra: 2 the precise time of offering, whether just before or just after the rising of the sun in the morning, and whether after sunset or after the appearance of the first star in the evening, is a subject of much discussion in the Brahmanas and Sūtras. If the fires were kept perpetually alight, then they required only to be brightened up for each occasion: if not, then the fire must be taken from the Garhapatya, either only every evening, it being used also for the morning, or each time: the Dakṣina might be kept perpetually alight, or taken out daily, or only on the new- and full-moon days, on which according to some authorities the sacrificer must himself perform the ritual. The main offering was milk, milked by an Aryan into a pail made by an Aryan: the milk was heated and mixed with water on the Garhapatya, and offered in the Ahavaniya and Garhapatya. At the end the sacrificer eats and offers four water libations to the gods, the Fathers, the seven seers, and Agni on the earth, or to other deities also. The Dakṣiṇa fire received no special honour. 

With the Agnihotra might be performed the ceremony of homage to the fires, Agnyupasthana, usually carried out at the night service only. The Ahavaniya is honoured first, then the cow from which the milk was taken, then the Garhapatya, and then the cow, or its calf might be substituted for the cow. At the end the sacrificer names the name of his dear son who is to succeed him in the duty. The same close connexion of the offering and the home is seen in the fact that, on going on a journey, the householder takes leave of the fires, and on return approaches them with wood and words of welcome. If he goes away from the old house for good, he offers a libation to Vastoṣpati, the lord of the abode, while his cart has one horse, the right-hand one, spanned, and the other not yoked. The obligation to offer the Agnihotra ends only when one becomes a wandering mendicant. 

There can be little doubt that even as early as the Rigveda there was present the idea that the Agnihotra, with its brightening up of the fires, was a spell to aid the rising of the sun, a view which was doubtless the ground of the opinion of those who pressed for the performance of the ceremony before sunrise.3

The view of Feist (Kultur der Indoger- manen, p. 345) that the fire worship takes its origin in respect to the spirits of the dead who congregate at the hearth is untenable; cf. Wissowa, Archiv f.

But we must not decide from this that the origin of the rite was a mere spell it is clearly the tendance of the god in the house, the family fire in a developed form in the Śrauta, in a simple form in the domestic ritual.
