The rite of twelve days, DvadaŚaha, may be performed either as an Ahina or a Sattra, and all rites with more than twelve pressing days are Sattras the number of years they may be continued extends to thirty-six or more up to 1,000. The Sattras all differ from other forms of the Soma sacrifice, because all the performers must be consecrated and must be Brah- mans there is therefore no separate sacrificer: all share in the benefits of the offering each bears the burden of his own errors, whereas at the ordinary sacrifice the sacrificer receives the benefit and the evil results of errors alike. Moreover, they should usually be Brahmans who perform the same kinds of rites, and have the same deity, Tanúnapāt or NaraŚañsa, at the Apri invoca- tion; if not, the deity of the majority is adopted. During the Sattra all other sacrifices cease to be performed by the priests taking part in the rite any sexual intercourse is forbidden, as are swift movements, laughing without holding the hand before the mouth, untruth, connexions with non-Aryans, and so forth. One of them plays the part of sacrificer: the others hold on to him when he does those acts which only one man can perform. The Adhvaryu consecrates the sacrificer, and so on until a student consecrates the Unnetr. The wives of the priests are also consecrated each with her husband. There are no fees instead the priests go south saying as they shake black skins, 'What here from my life departeth, that, O Agada, I bring to thee as a fee,' evidently a device to secure long life. The aims of the Sattras are most

various: the obtaining of wealth, of cattle, of offspring, of prosperous marriage, and many other things. Much as they are, it is clear, elaborated by the priest, they reflect here and there primitive conceptions of sacrifice. 

The model of all Sattras is the DvadaŚaha, which is made up of a Praya- niya and an Udayaniya, which, as in all Sattras as opposed to Ahinas, must both be Atirātra days, as the beginning and concluding rites respectively of a Prsthya Ṣaḍaha, and of either 4 Chandomas or 3 Chandomas and an Avivakya day as the tenth. The name Prsthya is based on the different treatment of the Pṛṣṭha Stotra of each day corresponding to the Castra of the Hotṛ on the first it is in the Rathantara tune, on the second the Bṛhat, the third the Vairupa, the fourth the Vairaja, the fifth the Śakvara, the sixth the Raivata. Of these days the first and fourth are Agnistomas, the others Ukthyas. The Chandomas are Ukthyas, the tenth is an Atyagnistoma: it is called Avivakya, because on that day no dispute about errors in the ceremony is allowed.1 A further variation is possible: on the fourth and ninth days the Agrayana cup may be drawn first, on the six and seventh the Śukra, in which case the Stotras and the Śastras must also be transposed, or they may be trans- posed without change in the order of the cups: this makes the period of ten days bear the term vyudhachandas. The Soma is daily watched by one priest, the rest may study the Veda, fetch wood, and eat. The tenth day is marked by interesting rites, the singing of the Saman called the success of the Sattra, and the performance of a Brahmodya like that at the horse offering or regarding the unqualified Prajāpati. 

Rules are given for building up the DvadaŚaha to longer Sattras; the simplest addition is that of a Mahāvrata day after the period of ten days: other additions are inserted before that period, the shorter before the longer. But these rules are very much varied in practice. Of the various forms by far the most interesting is the Gavām Ayana, the way of the cows', which is a Sattra of one year's duration.

The beginning of this Sattra 2 is variously prescribed, at the full moon of Phalguna or Caitra, or four days before the full moon of these months or of Magha. The middle day, the Viṣuvant, divides it into two halves, of which the latter is in many respects intended to be the reverse of the former. The scheme of the offering is a Prayaṇīya Atirātra, a CaturvinŚa day on which the twenty-four-fold Stoma is used, the form being either an Agniṣṭoma or an Ukthya; five months each of four Abhiplava Sadahas and one Pṛṣṭhya ; a sixth one of one Pṛṣṭhya, three Abhiplavas, one Abhijit, an Agniṣṭoma rite, and three Svarasāman days making up 28, to which the first two days are added to complete the month. Then comes the Viṣuvant. The second half- year has as the seventh month three Svarasamans, one ViŚvajit, one Pṛṣṭhya, and three Abhiplavas; then months 8 to 11 have one Pṛṣṭhya and four

Abhiplavas each, and the last has three Abhiplavas, one Ayus day, one Go day, one DaŚarātra, and the Mahāvrata and Udayaniya days. 

The Abhiplava Sadaha, which is often used in Sattras of all kinds and also in Ahinas, differs in certain respects from the Pṛṣṭhya. In the first place in it the Prstha Stotra is alternatively Rathantara and Bṛhat only. In the second place the days of the Abhiplava are differentiated as Jyotis, Go, and Ayus according to the Stomas used for the different Stotras. The Jyotis form, which is an Agniṣṭoma, having twelve Stotras only, employs for 1-6 the PañcadaŚa, for 7-11 the SaptadaŚa, and for 12 the EkavinŚa. The other two are Ukthyas and have fifteen Stotras: for 1 the Go uses the PañcadaŚa, for 2-5 the Trivṛt, for 6-10 the SaptadaŚa, for 11-15 the EkavinŚa. The Ayus has for 1 Trivṛt, for 2-5 PañcadaŚa, for 6-10 SaptadaŚa, and 11-15 EkavinŚa. At the Viṣuvant the sun is honoured with offerings, but the Mahavrata 1 is much more fully known to us. The rite is according to the ritual allowed to be performed variously as a one-day rite, an Ahina, or in a Sattra, and the latter is its natural place. It is clearly an old festival of the winter solstice, and not even originally, as Hillebrandt holds, of the summer solstice, when the strengthening of the sun was an essential duty. There is beaten an earth drum, doubtless to scare away the demons who might attempt to overthrow the power of the sun; the Hotṛ sits on a swing and is swung to and fro, to represent the path of the sun in the sky, and strengthen its power to perform it; ritual abuse is exchanged for fertility purposes, between a student or, in a later usage, a Magadha, and a hetaira; there is actually carried out sexual intercourse; the consecrated persons are alternately praised and reviled; there is a mimic fight between an Aryan and a Śūdra for the possession of a white round skin which is declared to be a symbol of the sun; 2 the skin of an unfruitful cow is hung up or stretched out and warriors pierce through it with arrows, perhaps as a rain spell. Women celebrate to the sound of the lute 

in the south the patrons of the ceremony: maids dance round the fire with water pitchers, while the Stotra is being performed: they pour the water on the fire, and their song shows that they desire richness in milk with water for the cows. The desire of heat and rain seems clearly united: the position of the sun nearest earth is indicated by the priest, who touches the board of the

swing and the earth with one hand, and says, The God hath united with the goddess '.1 

From the point of view of the priest, most important elements of the Mahāvrata are the Mahāvrata Stotra or the Prstha Stotra, corresponding to the Mahaduktha of the Hotṛ: it is noteworthy for the fact that it is intended to reproduce the form of the fire, the five Samans, the Gayatra, Rathantara, Bṛhat, Bhadra, and Rājana, are equated to the head, right and left wing, tail and body, and accompanied by the Stomas from Trivṛt to PañcavinŚa in order. The later ritual of the Śankhayana Śrauta Sūtra identifies the Stotra with the body of a man, showing the influence of the mystic speculations of the priests who performed the Agnicayana, 'piling of the fire', and who saw in this act the making up of the universal father, the creator god Prajapati, identified with the primeval giant who in the Puruṣasūkta is conceived as having, when sacrificed, provided the material for the whole world."

Of other Sattras an interesting one is that performed on the Dṛṣadvati, a specially sacred river, and still more that on the Sarasvati, which is marked by many special rites. The sacrifice is performed as the sacrificer moves along the bank from the place where the Sarasvati disappears in the desert, across the confluence with the Dṛṣadvati, at the crossing of which an offering is made to Apam Napāt, to the place where the stream arises, the Plakṣa Prāsravana, where an offering is made to Agni as Kama, desire'. The sacrifice is accompanied by the driving of a hundred young calves along with a bull into the wood, and is terminated when these have reached the number of a thousand, or the sacrificer dies, or the cows disappear. At the end of the whole sacrifice, a mare and a woman are given as a present to the worthiest of those who have taken part in the performance. The final bath is taken at Kāravapacava on the Yamuna. This and the Drṣadvati offering are important for the fact that they mention several places of the Kuru land, such as Parīṇah," and indicate the boundaries of that country, the chief home of Brahmanism.
