The Agniṣṭoma is the model on which innumerable other kinds of sacrifice can be formed, in order to bring about certain desires. The Vicvajit is occasionally mentioned in it a man gives all his goods as the fee, or at least a thousand cattle and hundred horses. In the former case he first hands over to his eldest son his share in the property. After the offering he spends twelve nights in different places, three where an Udumbara is, eating fruits and roots only, three among Niṣādas, without eating the grains cultivated by them, three with folk, and three with folk like himself, or according to another view either VaiŚyas or Rajany... The symbolic nature of the rite is obvious. 

The six Sadyaḥkras are offerings which in one day include all the rites, including the Dikṣa from the beginning to the end of a Soma sacrifice. The first serves as a model of the rest: the priests, Hotṛ, Udgātṛ, Adhvaryu, and Brahman, are stationed in the four quarters at considerable distances: the altar is a sown field, or field full of ripe barley or rice: the Uttaravedi a threshing-floor. Milk is churned into butter in a skin by the primitive mode of shaking it. The offering is supposed to bring the attainment of heaven, of cattle, and of the defeat of a rival. The second removes disease, and brings strength and food. The fourth is the ViŚvajit Śilpa, at which one should give as many fees as possible; the fifth is the Cyena, which is employed for

exorcism, and the fee in this case consists of one-eyed lame cattle without horns or tails, mixed with diseased ones.1 

Of special importance are the four Vratya Stomas, which are rites. apparently intended for the admission into the Brahmanical community of persons who though Aryans have been living outside that community. It is in the ritual said to be intended for the case of persons who have lost their position as twice born by various reasons, including living among non-twice- born people. Of such people it is said that they do not study, do not practise agriculture or trade; they call good words bad, perhaps a reference to differ- ences of dialect, they punish the guiltless with blows, presumably an allusion to difference of law, and, though unconsecrated, speak the speech of the con- secrated. According to the views of Katyayana, the first offering is for Vratyas, who, skilled in dance, song, and music, are capable of teaching these arts to a company of Vratyas, the second for eunuchs, the third for those of little account, and the fourth for old impotent men. The dress of the Vratyas is described as including a special kind of turban (uşnişa), white garments with black fringes, and a curious kind of bow without a string (jyähroḍa): at the rite also is used a special sort of cart (vipatha), and a silver ornament as worn by Vratyas. The Gṛhapati, who is to be chosen from the leader of the Vratyas to be con- verted, carries two skins, one white, one black, and a pair of shoes,, black and shaped like ears, or provided with ears. All these articles are to be given as a fee at the proper time to an unworthy Brahman from Magadha, a sign that Magadha was not regarded as strictly Brahmanical, or to Vratyas who have not yet been converted, and who are thus made scapegoats. When the ceremony is over, the Vrätyas cease to have that characteristic: they become admitted to full membership of the Brahmanical society, and can engage in the pursuit of sacred learning. 

The rites are specially interesting, as they mention several words which are not easily explicable, and evidently were not well understood at a very early date they may be borrowed from the speech of the eastern tribes, and together with the mention of the Brahman from Magadha suggest, but do not prove, that the Vratyas came from the east rather than from the west, though we know that the western tribes were by no means fully Brahmanized,

* A rash hypothesis (cf. above, Chap. 1), based on late linguistic facts, and supported by worthless ethnological material, claims that the Vedic Indians were Aryans who entered their homes from Chitral and Gilgit and not directly connected with the Punjab (see e. g. Risley, People of India, pp. 55 ff.). The theory contradicts the evidence of the Rigveda, and the Chitral route, as Holdich (The Gates of India) insists, is impracticable for a people's migration.

Vedic Ritual

and it has been suggested that the Vratyas represented one or other of the many Aryan tribes which were in motion in the period 1500-1000 B.C. There are clear traces that the Udgātrs were specially active in the business of bringing in these outlying members of the Brahmanical society: possibly this may stand in some relation to the fact that the Chandogas were never held in the highest repute among the Vedic Indians.1 The suggestion of Charpentier a that we are to see in these Vratyas adherents of Rudra-Śiva must be regarded as impossible. It is, however, of interest to note that already in the Athar- vaveda3 the Vratya is a well-known figure, and by the curious ideas of that Veda is turned into an expression of the supreme deity.

Of other rites of this class the Upahavya is interesting, as it is born of strife between the gods and the Asuras, and in it the names of the gods are carefully changed to avoid mentioning them aloud: thus the name of Indra is Śakra, of Soma Indu, and likewise the hotā deva is changed to hota yakṣe, and so on, even the simple word sarva, all, becoming the old viŚva. There is a rite, the Sarvasvāra, for one who wishes to die: the sacrificer in it is com- pletely covered over and sits facing south on a dark skin. In the Bṛhaspatisavɛ on the other hand, which is offered by one who wishes such rank as a Puro- hitaship, the sacrificer must be treated with respect, be greeted by others with- out returning the salutation, and be styled Sthapati, ‘lord', all these things by sympathetic magic working the desired end. If the Apacitis are offered to bring a man honour, he must pay dearly in Dakṣiņās in proportion to what he aspires to attain, and so in all these offerings the greed of the priest for fees shows itself.

The Gosava is of special interest, because it involves incest with one's mother, sister, and a woman of one's own Gotra, that is with whom marriage is forbidden. The Jaiminiya Brāhmaṇa records that Janaka of Videha declined to undertake it, though it would have secured him the world of the Ox, doubtless Prajapati as in the Atharvaveda," but a Śibi king did perform it, carrying out literally the rule of acting according to nature.

* VOJ. xxv. 355-88; see Keith, JRAS. 1913, pp. 155-00. Caland (JB., p. 184) amazingly argues that the fact that in JB. IŚana is hostile to the Vratyas supports the theory.
