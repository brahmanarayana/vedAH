      <description>THE householder of the Vedic period was expected to maintain a fire normally in his dwelling, sometimes, however, in a special place outside the actual house. The establishment of such a fire was normal on marriage, on the division of the property of a family, the return of a student from his studentship, or the death of the head of the family, when his eldest son was expected to kindle a new fire.</description>

The daily offerings of the householder include offerings at night and morning to Agni and Prajapati, and Surya and Prajapati respectively there is, however, great divergence as to the nature of the offerings, usually rice or barley, and the exact deities and times of offering. Further, there are five great offerings to be performed; the first is the Devayajña, that for the gods made in the fire morning and evening, when the meal is ready.</description>

      <description>As is natural the domestic ritual devotes much space to the minute description of large number of rites, mainly magical in essence, which accompany the child from even before birth to its death. In the third or fourth month or even later after pregnancy takes place the rite for quickening a male child, Pumsavana, the essence of which consists in the placing in the nostril of the wife by her husband of a Nyagrodha shoot, which he purchases in due form and which is pounded, either by a young girl, or a student or a wife who is keeping a vow, or a Brahmabandhu, a term which is perhaps best taken as a Brahman</description>

      <description>A Brahman child in the eighth year from conception or birth, a Kṣatriya in the eleventh, a VaiŚya in the twelfth, should be received as a student by a teacher: the period can be increased to 16, 22, and 24 years respectively, but after that a youth has lost the right to say the Savitri verse, and should not be associated with, taken as a pupil, permitted to sacrifice, or accepted as a sonin-law if the Savitri is lost for three generations, the right of the sacraments is lost, and can only be regained by the performance of the Śrauta rite called the Vratya Stomas.</description>

      <description>The duty of the Vedic Indian to marry is assumed by all the texts, and the domestic ritual gives precise rules for the performance of the legitimate and honourable form of marriage,&amp;quot; ignoring as a rule the irregular forms based upon capture, violence, or mere mutual love without parental approval, which are recognized by the law books in various forms, Gandharva, Asura, PaiŚāca, and Rākṣasa, as well as the romantic form of nominal self-choice by the bride of a suitor, the Svayamvara which bears traces of a test of skill of suitors by the king or other parent of high rank similar to that of Kleisthenes.</description>
