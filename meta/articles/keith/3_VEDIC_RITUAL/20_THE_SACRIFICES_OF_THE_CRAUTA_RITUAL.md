title = "20 THE SACRIFICES OF THE CRAUTA RITUAL"

+++

## 01. General Characteristics 

THE rites of the Crauta ritual have much essentially in common, in addition to the necessity of the use of the three or one at least of the three fires in place of the domestic fire. They necessitate the presence of priests numbering from one up to sixteen, or with the Kauṣitakins seventeen,1 to whom should be added the actual performers of some of the minor actions in the more compli- cated forms of the ritual, whose number is not defined, and whose menial functions rendered them of no consequence in the eyes of the priests of the higher rank. It is obvious, for instance, that in the slaughtering of the victims there must often have been need for other aid than that of the Adhvaryu and his assistants proper, and the Śamitṛs are occasionally referred to as charged with the actual slaying: more often a general term like servant is used to apply to such helpers. 

As a result of the constant development of the ritual, the festivals of the Śrauta type are full of details which are of no consequence with regard to the meaning of the sacrifice: practically in no case is an important rite addressed to one god only: the effort on the contrary was clearly to find as much room as possible for as many gods as possible. We find, too, many variations among the details of the rites, of which but a few can be reduced to any simple principle. Thus we know that some families like the Jamadagnis and the Bhṛgus made five divisions or layers of the offerings, while other families a made but four, whence the former are called pañcavattins, and the latter caturavattins. Another distinction which has more religious value is the differences between families based on the distinction of the use of Tanünapät or NarāŚansa, as one of the deities invoked at the Apri litanies of the animal sacrifice, while the difference of dressing the hair is also of interest from the point of view of social usages, having many parallels in other lands.

In the Sutras the principle is laid down that the sacrifices are to be dis- tinguished as Prakṛtis and Vikṛtis, the former being the base on which the later are built up; thus the new- and full-moon sacrifices are the model for other sacrifices of the type known as Ișți, and for the animal sacrifice, in its form as an offering to Agni and Soma, on which further animal offerings are based. The Agnistoma again is the fundamental form of the Soma sacrifice:

on it are based other performances up to the DvadaŚãha inclusive, while on the latter are based the Sattras. Each sacrifice is divided into Pradhānas, the characteristics which mark it out as a special offering, and Añgas, the auxiliary parts which are common to many sacrifices, and which build the framework, Tantra, which serves to maintain the sacrifice. The distinction between the Yajatayas and the Juhotayas, the latter managed by the Adhvaryu alone and accompanied by the mere utterance of the word Svähä, hail',1 has already been noted. 

C 

In the Soma offering there is added the complications of the recitation of the Samans. The rule is that the Săman is a melody, which is performed on a verse of the Rigveda, and the verses can be sung to different melodies, for which purpose they have to be eked out by the addition of letters, or even of whole syllables, which have themselves no meaning, and of which as many as fifteen are enumerated.2 The nature of the tunes must have been varied in the extreme, to judge from the many names recorded, of which the Bṛhat and the Rathantara are the most notorious, but the nature of Indian music is an unsolved problem, and perhaps insoluble.3 Seven notes are mentioned, but their significance is much disputed. Each Saman is divided into parts, the most usual being that into Prastava, introduced by the word hum (huñkāra), sung by the Prastotr, the Udgitha, introduced by om, sung by the Udgatṛ, the Pratihāra, introduced by hum, sung by the Pratihartṛ, and the Nidhana, or finale, sung by all together. In some cases the Pratihāra is divided into two parts, the latter, the Upadrava, being sung by the Udgatṛ, or the Hiñkāra is made into a separate element. Moreover there are Upagātṛs, three in number, who accompany the song with the word ho. The contempt which through the Indian literature is more or less clearly shown for Saman singers is justified by the extraordinary stupidity of the position assigned to them. 

The singing of more than one verse on a tune is a Stotra, which usually is made up of a triplet or a Pragatha, a double verse, which is made into three for recitation purposes. From the Stotras are built up the Stomas, or forms of chanting Stotras. Of these there are many varieties. The simplest in some ways is the Trivṛt, which is the first used in the Agnistoma: it consists of nine verses, which can be variously arranged in sets of three, either as adg, beh, cfi, which is the Udyati form, or abc, def, ghi, the Parivartini, and abc, efd, igh, the Kulayini. On the other hand the other Stomas, the PañcadaŚa, SaptadaŚa, EkavinŚa, which with the Trivṛt are the main Stomas of the Agniṣṭoma, and others such as the PañcavinŚa, Trinava, TrayastrinŚa, CaturvinŚa, CatuŚcat- vārinŚa, and AṣṭācatvārinŚa, are all based on three verses or a Pragatha made into three. The numbers of the Stomas are derived from the number of verses which are used: thus the PañcadaŚa in one form is made up of aaabc, abbbc,

and abccc, the Hiñkāra being said before each set of three similar verses. Further complications will be noted later on. 

Before the Stotras can be performed the singers must obtain the approval of the Brahman and the Maiträvaruņa, who give it with the words om stuta, the Brahman saying also one of the Stomabhāgas, certain formulae provided for the purpose. The Stotra is followed by a Śastra, a recitation of the Hotṛ or his fellows, the signal for it being given by the performer of the Stotra saying eșă, 'this is the last verse.' The Hotṛ asks the Adhvaryu if he is to recite, the latter agrees. But at the morning litany in front of this dialogue are placed certain syllables, and a muttered prayer to MatariŚvan and the Kavis. This is followed by the silent praise, Tüṣṇīmjapa, and by the Puroruc, 'that which shines before', but in the midday and evening Śastras the place of the Puroruc is taken by Nivids, which are inserted in the hymns of the Śastra. The Nivids are introduced by the procedure of asking the Adhvaryu's authority to recite, but this formality is omitted in the case of the Puroruc at the first Śastra in the morning: at the second Śastra, on the other hand, we find seven Purorucs preceded by the dialogue of Hotṛ and Adhvaryu, and followed by a triplet. In the case of the midday Śastras there are further complications. In the first Śastra of the midday.and the evening pressings there are found sets of three verses called Pratipad and Anucara, which are preceded by the usual dialogue; then comes in the case of the midday Śastra, the Maruta Śastra, a Pragatha addressed to Indra, which is recited as three verses, the last part of each verse being repeated with the first of the next: thus the Pragatha, which consists of a Bṛhati1 and Satobṛhati 2 or Kakubh and Satobṛhati, is made into a Bṛhati and two Kakubh verses. This is followed by a Pragatha for Bṛhaspati, Dhayyās, supplementary verses, a Pragatha for the Maruts, the hymn in which the Nivid is inserted, the Ukthavirya formula, and then as in the other Śastras come the offering verse and the libation. In the case of the second Śastra of the midday and evening pressings, and all the Śastras of the assistants of the Hotṛ, the Hotrakas, the same sort of beginning is prescribed, but the verses are called Stotriya and Anurupa, names which refer to the fact that they follow the strophe and antistrophe of the corresponding Stotra of the Saman singers, which obey the rule that the Anurupa, corresponding verse', should follow the Stotriya in metre, number of syllables, and deity. As usual the rule is obeyed that the two verses of the Stotriya are made into three in recitation, and so with the Anurupa. Then in the second Śastra of the midday pressing, the Niskevalya, come Dhāyyās, a Sāmapragatha, the hymn with the Nivid, the Ukthavirya and the offering verse with the libation.

In the first Śastra of the evening pressing, the VaiŚvadeva, the Pratipad and Anucara are followed by a hymn with a Nivid, then a verse for Vayu, then a hymn with a Nivid to sky and earth, a hymn with a Nivid for the

Ṛbhus, three isolated verses, and a hymn with a Nivid to the All-gods. The second, the Agnimāruta, is composed of a hymn with a Nivid to VaiŚvānara, a Dhayya, a hymn with a Nivid to the Maruts, the Stotriya and Anurupa made from Pragathas, a hymn with a Nivid to Jatavedas, and a mass of miscellaneous stanzas addressed to the waters, &c. The other Śastras are less important the specimens given indicate the confusion and elaboration of ideas. 

2 

In other cases there takes place an elaborate process of intermingling both verses and parts of verses of different strophes with one another. This is the rule with the recitation of the Välakhilya hymns, which may be treated in two different but both complicated ways,1 with the Mahānāmni verses, with the verse for the Apyāyana or swelling out of the dry Soma stems, and so forth. It is only worth noting that as early as the Rigveda these puerilities seem to have been in vogue. 

The most important division of the sacrifices is that between the Soma offerings and the offerings which are sometimes classed as Haviryajñas, and which differ essentially from the Soma sacrifice as they do not employ the Saman singers. With the latter may be classed the animal sacrifice, but it also forms an integral and important part of the Soma offering. 

## 02. The Establishment and Re-establishment of the Fires 
The ritual texts lay down various periods as appropriate for the setting up of the sacred fires, the spring is the scason for a Brahman, the summer for a Kṣatriya, the rainy season for a Rathakara, and the autumn for a VaiŚya, or the cool season is suited for all castes. They also suggest that the proper time is the new moon, especially in conjunction with certain asterisms, but the full moon is also permissible. The essential part of the rite which takes two days is the setting up of the fires: on the first day are set up two sheds, the one for the Garhapatya, the other for the Ahavaniya fire: the actual altar of the first is round, that of the second square: the Dakṣiņa fire is south of the Garhapatya and is shaped like a half moon. The fire is obtained for the Garhapatya either by friction, or by being borrowed from the house of a wealthy man or distinguished sacrificer. The night of the first day is spent by the sacrificer and his wife in wakefulness to the noise of lutes and flutes. Early in the morning the new fire for the hearths is produced by friction, and a horse is brought to watch and further the process by its presence, doubtless as a symbol of the fire or the sun. Moreover, while the fire is being produced by friction from the wood, Samans may be sung. As soon as the fire appears the sacrificer breathes upon it and inhales it. It is placed on the Garhapatya and 1 Cf. Oldenberg, Prolegomena, pp. 212 ff., * ApŚS. v. 1 ff.; BŚS. ii; MŚS. i. 5; 6. 5;

wood placed upon the fire: it is addressed with words which recall the ancestors of the offerer: thus an Añgirasa refers to Añgiras, a Bhargava to the Bhrgus, a Rajanya to Indra, a Kṣatriya to Varuna, a VaiŚya to Manu Grāmaṇī, the typical village headman, and a Rathakṛt to the Rbhus, the famous chariot makers among the gods. At the same time Samans may be sung, not by the Saman singers, but, as in the Vājapeya and the Sautrāmaṇī rites, by the Brahman or alternatively by the Adhvaryu himself. Then a brand is taken from the Garhapatya and borne to the Ahavaniya, the horse preceding it, and the sacrificer following it so that the smoke reaches him : it is carried at first knee high, then navel high, and then the height of the face. The Dakṣina fire is then in one version lighted in the same way; according to others it precedes the setting up of the Ahavaniya: it may also be made from the fire which on the preceding day was placed on the Garhapatya for cooking the porridge for the priest: at any rate it afterwards can be used for cooking any offerings save meat offerings. 

After the Ahavaniya is set up follows, in the case of a Kṣatriya only it seems, the setting up of a Sabhya fire, one doubtless in the Sabha, the meeting hall of the community. The ceremony for that is accompanied by the dicing for a cow as a prize by the priests perhaps or by Ksatriyas: the game is as usual unintelligible: it seems to have amounted to a test of the power to produce even numbers.1 In the normal case this ceremony is not performed, and the establishment of the fires ends with a full offering of butter to Agni, after which the Agnihotra can be duly performed with the fires. Twelve days afterwards, the fires being carefully maintained in the interval, may be per- formed the Tanühavis offerings which are offerings to Agni in three forms, Pavamana, Pavaka, and Śuci. As soon as the performance of the estab- lishment is over, the sacrificer is bound to observe chastity for 8 to 12 days, maintain the fire, offer the Agnihotra, and sleep on the ground near the fire. After that he must for all his days avoid untruth, place no bad wood on the fire, eat nothing cooked by a covered fire, drink no water from a ship, and so on. If he is prosperous he must keep up the fires all his life. 

2 

The ceremony of re-establishment is prescribed in cases where the fires bring the sacrificer no luck. The old fires are allowed to go out, and, after a break of three days to a year, new fires are established in much the same way as before, but the fire is nourished when produced with KuŚa grass, not with wood. In the fore- and after-offerings which are part of the rite the use of different forms, Vibhakti, of the word Agni is expressly enjoined, doubtless to secure the special attention of the god to the new fires. The fees for the priest contain references to the character of the rite:; so for instance a mended garment and repaired chariot are given. Traces of a periodic re-establishment of outworn fires cannot be proved: the mere fact that the re-establishment,

if necessary, is placed at the period of the rains as well as at other times is inadequate evidence on which to found any theory.1 

## 03. The Fire-God Oblation or Agnihotra 

It is the duty of the man who has established his fires, as of the man who has no fires, to offer daily, morning and evening, the Agnihotra: 2 the precise time of offering, whether just before or just after the rising of the sun in the morning, and whether after sunset or after the appearance of the first star in the evening, is a subject of much discussion in the Brahmanas and Sūtras. If the fires were kept perpetually alight, then they required only to be brightened up for each occasion: if not, then the fire must be taken from the Garhapatya, either only every evening, it being used also for the morning, or each time: the Dakṣina might be kept perpetually alight, or taken out daily, or only on the new- and full-moon days, on which according to some authorities the sacrificer must himself perform the ritual. The main offering was milk, milked by an Aryan into a pail made by an Aryan: the milk was heated and mixed with water on the Garhapatya, and offered in the Ahavaniya and Garhapatya. At the end the sacrificer eats and offers four water libations to the gods, the Fathers, the seven seers, and Agni on the earth, or to other deities also. The Dakṣiņa fire received no special honour. 

With the Agnihotra might be performed the ceremony of homage to the fires, Agnyupasthana, usually carried out at the night service only. The Ahavaniya is honoured first, then the cow from which the milk was taken, then the Garhapatya, and then the cow, or its calf might be substituted for the cow. At the end the sacrificer names the name of his dear son who is to succeed him in the duty. The same close connexion of the offering and the home is seen in the fact that, on going on a journey, the householder takes leave of the fires, and on return approaches them with wood and words of welcome. If he goes away from the old house for good, he offers a libation to Vastoṣpati, the lord of the abode, while his cart has one horse, the right-hand one, spanned, and the other not yoked. The obligation to offer the Agnihotra ends only when one becomes a wandering mendicant. 

There can be little doubt that even as early as the Rigveda there was present the idea that the Agnihotra, with its brightening up of the fires, was a spell to aid the rising of the sun, a view which was doubtless the ground of the opinion of those who pressed for the performance of the ceremony before sunrise.3

319 

But we must not decide from this that the origin of the rite was a mere spell it is clearly the tendance of the god in the house, the family fire in a developed form in the Crauta, in a simple form in the domestic ritual. 

## 04. The New-moon and Full-moon Sacrifices 

These sacrifices 1 are of special value as they form the model for all sacri- fices of the type called Işti, which include an enormous number of offerings for special ends; in all these cases the sacrifice is assumed to be performed pre- cisely as in the new- and full-moon offerings, but with the distinction that some special rite is inserted in the place of the essential features of these offerings, which are at the full-moon offering a cake for Agni and Soma, and at the new- moon offering a cake for Agni and Indra. Moreover, at the latter offering some authorities allowed a milk mess made of sweet and sour milk for Indra or Mahendra, while others restricted this offering to one who offered the Soma sacrifice. The new and full moon themselves received no offerings, except in the view of certain authorities who prescribed offerings to the Parvans: the times served only to fix the dates of the offerings, and there was, it is clear, difficulty in deciding exactly when the offerings should be made. Two days were required at new moon, but one might suffice at the full moon. On the first day the ceremonies were in the main preparatory, the making ready of the fires, and the taking of a vow by the sacrificer, which involved abstinence from meat, sleeping on the ground, the cutting of hair and beard, and so on. If the milk mess were to be offered on this day, a twig of PalaŚa or Śami wood was cut to drive away the calves from the cows, for the milking of the latter, a rite which is paralleled in western Europe. The ceremonies of the second day consisted in the preparation of the rice, its pounding and husking, the cooking of the cakes, the preparation of the altar, the girding of the wife of the sacrificer, the looking at a pot of butter, the covering of the altar with the grass, and the setting up of the partitioning sticks which were intended to keep off evil spirits. At the end of these preliminaries the real sacrifice begins; first come fifteen Samidhenī verses accompanying the laying on of kindling wood. The verses are joined into a single whole by the device of pausing after the first half verse of each. Then come two libations of the butter, doubtless in part at least necessary to make the fire burn brightly; between them comes the Pravara, the enumeration of the seers who were claimed as ancestors by the sacrificer-or if he were not a Brahman by his Purohita-and the invitation of the gods, whom Agni is invoked to bring to the offering in the order in which they were to be honoured. After the second of these Aghāras comes the formal choosing of the Hotṛ by the Adhvaryu on the authority of

[Part III 

the Agnidhra, in which the ancestors of the sacrificer are again named. The Hotṛ then touches the Adhvaryu and Agnidhra, in order doubtless to establish a community between them. Then come the fore-offerings of butter to the kindling sticks, the god Tanunapāt or NarāŚansa, the sacrificial food (iḍā), the gods who have been invited to the offering and are now honoured. Then come the Ajya offerings of butter for Agni and Soma, which at the new moon must be accompanied by verses containing the word vṛdh, 'grow', and at the full moon by verses referring to the slaying of Vṛtra. There follows a cake for Agni, a butter offering made in a low tone for Agni and Soma, and then the offering, to Agni and Soma at the full moon, to Agni and Indra, with or with- out a milk mess for Indra, at the new moon. The close of the offering is marked by an offering to Agni Sviṣṭakṛt, 'the maker of the sacrifice correct', in which all the gods are invoked. Then comes the tasting of the offering by the priest, the Brahman has a special portion, the PraŚitra, the Agnidhra another, the Şaḍavatta, and all the priests invoke the Iḍā, which is taken from all the offerings, and, while doing so, they touch the sacrificer. Then the cakes are given to them, and thereafter each has a part of the Iḍa. The Fathers are invoked to take part, and the fees are given, in this case the Anvāhārya mess cooked in the Dakṣiņa fire, perhaps merely because of the name. The dis- tribution of the fees is followed by the Anuyājas, to the strew, NaraŚansa, and Agni Svisṭakṛt, and the Sūktavāka, which concludes with an invocation of prosperity for the sacrificer and a prayer; at the end of this prayer the Prastara, or bundle of grass which is supposed to represent the sacrificer, is put in the fire. Then comes the Śamyuvāka, an invocation of prosperity, accompanied by the burning of the enclosing sticks. The remains are offered to the All-gods, then follow four Patnisamyājas, offerings to the gods with the wives of the gods, to Soma, Tvaṣṭr, the wives of the gods, and Agni Gṛhapati the third is offered under a covering while the wife of the sacrificer touches the Adhvaryu: the offerings are of butter, and made in the Garhapatya fire. Then come minor rites to accompany the burning of the strew, and to make good defects, the Rakṣases are given the fragments which have been produced in the husking of the rice, the wife's girdle is loosened and laid down, the sacrificer in imitation of and assimilation to Visņu strides three steps from the south hip of the altar ground, which is made to be like the shape of a woman, to the east, pays reverence to the Ahavaniya and Garhapatya, and then lays aside his vow. 

The rite is to be performed all one's life, or for thirty years, or for fifteen only, in which case the two offerings are to be conjoined in the Dākṣāyaṇa form1 it is celebrated every day for a year only, both forms being used. In the case of the first offering of the new- and full-moon sacrifice, the Anvāram-

bhaṇīyǎ Iṣṭi is offered, which consists of a cake on eleven potsherds for Vişņu, a pap for Sarasvati, and a cake on twelve potsherds for Sarasvant. It is offered as an independent rite on the first full-moon day after the Agnyādhāna and Agnihotra. Each new- and full-moon sacrifice can be followed by an offering to Aditi and to Indra Vaimṛdha, and the sacrifice can be carried out with Soma if desired and so also the other Haviryajñas.1 

The position of Agni and Soma in the ritual is peculiar in view of the rarity of the conjunction of these gods in the Rigveda, and it is a legitimate and probable conjecture of Oldenberg's that the place they obtained was only gradually won by them, in consequence in some degree at least of the tendency to see the moon in Soma. 

## 05. The Four-month or Seasonal Sacrifices 

3 

The three four-month offerings are connected intimately with the seasons of the year, the VaiŚvadeva being offered in spring, the Varunapra- ghāsas in the rains, and the Sākamedhas in the autumn, at the beginning of each season. The connexion with the seasons is shown by the formulae, the names of the months which are connected with certain libations, and the formal cutting of the hair which is connected with certain of the rites. The man who first performs them must begin with an Işți to Agni VaiŚvānara and Parjanya or an Anvārambhaṇiyā Iṣṭi. In each case the sacrifice is introduced by five libations to Agni, Soma, Savitṛ, Sarasvati, and Puṣan. In the first follow offerings to the Maruts, to the All-gods, and to heaven and earth, the first and last of cakes, the second of a milk mess. The season is indicated by the use of a tree with budding branches for the wood for the fire, while the strew is made from plants which are shooting. 

The second offering, the Varunapraghāsas, is more important. One point in it is the preparation of two animals, a ram and sheep, from barley, which the sacrificer and his wife cover with wool and equip with the marks of sex made prominent; the Adharyu makes the one, the Pratiprasthatṛ the other: there are two Vedis, and the south one is assigned to the latter priest, who there performs a mimicry of the action of the Adhvaryu. There are offerings to Indra and Agni, to Varuna, to the Maruts and to Ka: the ram and the ewe are offered in the milk messes presented to Varuna and the Maruts respec- tively, the remainder being eaten. A further important point is the ceremony already referred to, by which the wife of the sacrificer is called upon to admit what lovers she has and to offer in the Dakṣiņa fire the plates of Karambha, 'porridge', which number one more than the members of the family.

two figures Hubert and Mauss (Année sociol. ii. 111) adopt the view that they represent the spirit of barley as ferti- lizing and fertilized, which is eaten in the rite, and that the ram is Varuna visible', but this is quite impossible, or a mere mistranslation of CB. ii. 5. 2. 16.

husband and wife then share a bath, washing each other in it. The two elements of the rite are clearly enough the aim to secure the abundance of the flocks, and the sin offering to Varuna, whose presence in the rite may be due either to his deep and undeniable connexion with water, or merely be ac counted for by the sin offering and the concluding bath, which are clearly in great measure merely pieces of magic to which a religious connexion has been attached. 

" 

The third festival is the Sākamedhas: the number of offerings in it, especially for the Maruts, is considerable, but the most important element is a feast for the dead, the Pitṛyajña, or Mahāpitṛyajña, where the Fathers are honoured as Somavantas, connected with Soma', sitting on the strew, and as burnt by Agni'. The rite follows the rules for offerings to the dead: it takes place in a hut south of the Dakṣiņa fire, in which a Vedi is made and the fire there placed: the offerings are made with the term Svadha1 in place of Svāhā. Still more important is an offering to Tryambaka, which is an offering to Rudra, everything therefore being done in the north, the region of that god. At a cross-way a fire is made and cakes offered in it, at least four, but properly one more than the number of the members of the family. One, however, is thrown upon an ant-heap in the north with the words, 'This is thy portion the mole is thine animal, O Rudra'. On returning the priests engaged and the sacrificer all say, 'We supplicate Rudra away from us, away the god Tryambaka'. As in the offering to the Fathers, they go round the fire thrice from right to left, smiting the left thigh, then thrice in the opposite and normal way, smiting the right thigh, and the same form is followed by the unmarried women of the family, in verses which show that they hoped thus to secure marriage and avoid death. The remains of the cakes the sacrificer throws up in the air and catches as they fall: the cakes are then tied up in two baskets, tied to a bamboo, and placed on a tree or some similar object so high that an ox cannot reach them. Rudra is then asked to go away beyond the Mūjavants, after which the breath is held and the sacrificers return from the place without looking back, and touch water. The fee is a white horse, 

This term is of ambiguous sense, but refers perhaps to the self-disposal or volition of the dread spirits. This according to Oldenberg (Rel. des V'eda3, p. 581, n. 8) is due to their partaking of the food for the dead. Contra, Colinet, Mélanges Lévi, pp. 159 ff.

So also in the Baudhyavihara rite in HCS. ii. 9. 1. Rudra thus stands out in ritual as associated with a primitive mode of offering. Cf. above, Chap. 9, § 10. 

This common rite in connexion with

chthonic powers Weber (Rājasūya, p.11, n. 4) ingeniously but most implausibly conjectures to be due to a desire to show the complete confidence of safety produced in the mind of the performer by his devotion. The placing of gifts on a tree is a rite with many parallels; Meyer (Gesch. d. Alt. I. ii. p. 722) holds that the idea is to bring the offer- ing (e.g. in Ilion and Bambyke live animals) into immediate contact with the divinity temporarily resident in the tree. Cook (Zeus, i. 538) holds that the fertilizing animal is placed on the tree to secure its life. We are reduced to

or a bull, white or with white marks. The festival is followed by an offering to Śunāsirau, which is evidently an agricultural rite for ploughing, addressed to two parts or deities of the plough. The features of it are a cake on twelve potsherds for Śunasirau or Indra Śunasiriya, fresh milk or barley gruel for Vayu, and a cake on one potsherd for Surya : the fee is a six or twelve span plough or two plough beasts, while for the offering to Surya a white horse or sheep is the fee. A curious way of celebrating the whole of the offering together, in five days from the 11th day of the light half of Phalguna to the full moon, is recorded as practised by the Kathas. The offerings can also be connected with the Soma and the animal offering in such a way that the six days of the three make up a Pṛsthya Sadaha. 

## 06. First-fruit Sacrifice (Agrayana Işti) and others 

Before partaking of any of the fruits of the fields it is necessary for a man who has established the fires to make offerings. The normal offerings are those of rice in autumn, and barley in spring: alternatives are bamboo seeds in summer, and millet in autumn or the rains in these two cases Soma is the god to whom the offerings are made: in the other case Indra and Agni receive a cake of the new fruits, and the All-gods and heaven and earth also have offerings. In the first case the fee is a garment or a repaired car, in the second the firstborn of the calves cast that year. In place, however, of the ordinary Işți the new- and full-moon sacrifices may be performed, or the Agni- hotra made night and morning with the new fruits. Or, again, the rice or barley may be given to a cow to eat, and then the Agnihotra offered with the milk of that cow. In that case the motive of the offering may be taken as merely a desire to secure that the first-fruits shall, in the first place, be used by some one other than man; but it is more probable that we have nothing more here than the not rare practice of giving animals food in place of the deities, or yet more probably that the offering is merely a variety of the normal offering, milk being used instead of the actual first-fruits, a simple explanation, and one perfectly reasonable in itself. The offering of first-fruits then remains a perfectly natural offering to the gods, rather however as the formulae show an offering to secure the safe use of the fruits, than the expression of gratitude to the gods for their gift. That it was felt to be in any way sacramental, or even as inducing a special sense of community, is not to be seen in the Vedic evidence. 

Of other Istis there are innumerable varieties, but they are all based on the model of the new- and full-moon offerings, and differ only in the presence of 

mere conjecture. Helm (Altgerm. Rel. i. 244 f.) ascribes the German rite (Tac. Ann. i. 67) either to an offering to wind and air demons or to tree spirits.

certain new offerings. Thus, there are Iştis for one who desires a son, for various purifications, for making people subject to the sacrificer, and so on. One of the most interesting is the Karirişți, which is obviously a dressed up rain spell. A black horse is placed in the east facing west; the sacrificer robes it with a black garment and makes it neigh, and from the sounds which it makes and its actions he can foretell rain.1 The new-and full-moon offerings themselves can be applied to fulfil wishes, and forms of these offerings are mentioned such as the Munyayana, Turāyaṇa, and Vasisthayajña, which may extend to a year in duration. 

## 07. The Animal Sacrifice 

According to the Sutras we must distinguish between the animal sacrifice as an independent offering and the sacrifice as connected with the Soma sacrifice the offering of a goat to Agni and Soma in that offering is often treated as the Prakṛti of all animal sacrifices, but in some cases the indepen- dent animal offering which is called the NirudhapaŚubandha takes the place of the Agniṣomiya. The rite is to be performed by any man who establishes the fires, before he eats meat, and then yearly or half yearly, in which case the beginning of the bright course of the sun and the end of that period are pre- scribed by some authorities. The form of the offering is that of the new-moon sacrifice, the victim taking the place of the milk offered to Indra or Mahendra, but there is present another priest, the Maitrāvaruṇa, whose duty it is to give directions to the Hotṛ to say his Yajyä verses. For Indra and Agni, or Surya, or Prajapati, a goat is the victim; it must be perfect, free from blemish, such as the loss of a horn or an eye; but in other offerings than the Nirūḍha- paŚubandha are found many other animals, including normally oxen and sheep; and exceptionally, as at the piling of the fire, at the horse sacrifice and at human sacrifices, large numbers of victims are alleged to be offered, mainly if not entirely in theory. For Nirṛti the dove, owl, and hare are offered, to the Rakṣases the black dog, the ass with lop ears, and the unknown taraksu.4 Some animals appear as unfit for ordinary sacrifice, the dog, the durvaräha, 'bad boar', and edaka, vicious ram'. The normal rite occupies two days, of which the former is filled by preliminary rites, the second being the day of the actual sacrifice. The two days however may be compressed into one. 

An essential feature of the rite is the use of a post, to which the victim is

tied in the greater rites as many as eleven are used: the tree is solemnly cut down with protestations that it is not being injured, and, when a splinter is struck out of it in the cutting, that is kept and placed ultimately in the pit in which the post is inserted. The stump is treated with respect, and receives a libation, accompanied by a prayer that it shall spring up with a hundred shoots. The post is placed in a hole which is half within, half without the altar. Round the post a band is placed at the height of the navel; if the sacrificer wishes little or much rain he places it lower or higher. For the sacrifice the altar is placed west of the fire, and in the east third of it another altar, Uttaravedi, is provided as at the Varunapraghāsas, and a fire placed there, which takes the place of the normal Ahavaniya, while that serves as the Garhapatya. There are required also special implements, the spit for the heart, and the utensils by which the omentum is cooked. When the prepara- tions are over, the victim is bathed, and brought up, and tied to the post by a string, which is fastened to the left forefoot, round the back, and over the left horn it is then sprinkled and given a drink.1 Then the kindling verses are said, the butter oblations are offered, the victim is anointed with the butter, and the usual procedure of the new- and full-moon sacrifices followed down to the fore-offerings, which number eleven and to which the Apri litanies provide the Yajya verses. After the tenth of the fore-offerings, the splinter of the tree, and the one edge of the two-edged knife, are dipped in the butter: the actual slaying must be done with the unconsecrated side by the slaughterer or Śamitr, the other being used by the Adhvaryu to cut off portions for offering. The Agnidhra thrice carries a brand round the victim, the Apāvya libations are performed, the Adhvaryu gives through the Maitrā- varuņa the order to the Hotṛ to recite the old litany for the slaying of the victim; from the Garhapatya fire flame is placed on the Śamitra fire, the victim is then taken over to that fire, preceded by the Agnidhra with his fire- brand, followed by the Pratiprasthātṛ, touching it with the spit, the Adhvaryu holding on to him and the sacrificer to the Adhvaryu, thus keeping in close contact with the holy power in the victim. Then the victim, with its head facing west, its feet north, is by the Śamitrs strangled or pierced without sound, while the rest of those present turn their heads away. Then a libation is made, and the wife of the sacrificer brought up. The Adhvaryu or the wife pours water over the members of the victim and washes them. The omentum

is taken out and placed on a spit: in the first blood a grass blade is dipped, and thrown north-west or south-west as a spell to devote the enemy to the deepest darkness. It is cooked on the Śamitra fire, and then placed on the Uttaravedi, where it is covered with butter. Then come the eleventh fore- offering, the two butter portions, and then the offering of the whole of the omentum, which is covered with pieces of gold and butter. The spits are then cast into the fire, and the fees distributed, three barren or three milch cows. Then come the making of the rice cake and the cutting up of the victim: of these eighteen portions are made, of which the first eight count as daivatāni : the heart is cooked separately on a spit, the rest of the pieces are cooked in a pot, while the excrement, blood, and stomach are offered to the Rakṣases, in a pit west of the Śamitra fire outside the altar-ground. The various parts of the animal are then offered, the priests have shares both of the Ida as usual and of the meat. Then come the 11 after-offerings, offerings to the strew, the divine doors, &c. With each of the after-offerings a supplementary offering is connected in which the Pratiprasthātṛ offers pieces of the intestines which are left over. The splinter, the staff, of which the Maiträvaruņa never lets go, and the Prastara, bundle of grass', are put into the fire. The offering to the wives of the gods is performed with the tail of the victim, the heart spit is buried, with a verse imploring Varuna to forgive sin, in the presence of the sacrificer, his wife, and all the priests.1 As they go back they each pick up three dry twigs, and place them on the Uttaravedi. 

The animal sacrifice can be used for many special purposes, in which cases some variation is made to adapt it to the special end in view. 

In all its essential features the offering must be regarded as a gift only: the presence of the divine essence in the victim is clearly proved by abundant evidence, and the priests all taste of it. But there is not the slightest sign in the elaborate ritual, nor in the formulae which are recorded in full, that there was any idea that the death of the victim was the ritual death of one of the gods, or that the ceremony was a sacrament, in which worshippers renewed or strengthened their union with the god by a common meal.2 

## 08. The Soma Sacrifice 

3 

The model form of the Soma sacrifice may be said to be the Agnistoma, which is the simplest form of the one-day Soma sacrifice, that is an offering on which the Soma is offered on one day only, in the morning, at midday, and 

1 Above, Part III, Chap. 18, § 6. * Ibid., § 5. Hubert and Mauss (Année 

sociol. ii. 81, 82) indeed compare the invocation and consumption of the Iḍā to the Mass and transubstantiation; but this is clearly a grave exaggeration. The Ida is the divine power present in the food when eaten : there is no question of the death and eating of

a divinity.

The Soma Sacrifice

in the evening. The name Agniṣṭoma appears to be due to the fact that the last of the Samans used on the day is addressed to Agni. Its time of per formance is left vague by the texts: the evidence that it was a spring festival, celebrated at the new- or full-moon, which marked the beginning of the year, at which the nectar of the gods was offered to them in the shape of King Soma, as is held by Hillebrandt, is clearly inadequate even to make probable this thesis. 

In the Soma sacrifice the animal sacrifice plays an important part. In the first place, on the last of the Upasad days, which precede the day of pressing, there is an offering of a goat for Agni and Soma: secondly, there is a victim which is offered throughout the day of pressing, and which is sacrificed to Agni in the Agniṣṭoma, but in the Ukthya form of the Soma sacrifice to Indra and Agni, in the SodaŚin to Indra, and in the Atirātra to Sarasvati: the more prevalent view, however, adds the extra victim to each different form, so that the Atirātra form has all four. Thirdly, after the final bath and before the concluding Işți there is a barren cow for Mitra and Varuņa, or three for Mitra and Varuna, the All-gods, and Bṛhaspati. 

The offering is preceded by the choice of the priests, who are invited to come by a herald announcing the offering, and the obtaining of a place of sacrifice which the sacrificer asks from the prince, and which the latter must give on pain of the grave displeasure of the priest. Before or after this act, the consecration of the sacrificer takes place in the manner above1 described. The length of the consecration may last anything from one, three, or four days up to a year he sends out people to obtain food for him in this time, and his name is absolutely taboo. Then comes the purchase of the Soma, in which takes place a pretended buying by a cow, but it is taken away from the seller: there is a clear mimicry in some measure of the winning of the divine drink from the hands of the Gandharvas. The Soma is then brought forward on a cart, and the Subrahmanya utters the formula, whence he derives his name, and which invites Indra to the drinking of the Soma. The guest-offering is then given to the Soma, and the priests and the sacrificer, by touching together butter taken from the guest-offering, conclude a close alliance not to prove false to one another in the rite. The Agnidhra brings the Madanti waters which all touch, and the sacrificer undertakes the Avāntaradīkṣā, ' intermediate consecration', in which he draws tighter his girdle, clasps more firmly his fist, and only drinks warm milk. Then comes the Pravargya rite, which will be described below, and three days of Upasads, in which offerings are made before and after midday with reference to the iron, silver, and golden forms of Agni. The term refers to sieges, but it is impossible to accept the suggestion of Hillebrandt 2 that the rites of besieging cities have been here interpolated the siege is a mythical one. The second Upasad day is the time

[Part III 

for the construction of the Mahavedi, 'great altar'. The carts, which have the Soma, are placed in it, and three paces east from its west end is the Sadas, 'seat', which is a hut covered over, in which ceremony the Udgâtṛ helps the Adhvaryu as in other parts of the service. In front of the axle of the right- hand cart four sounding holes are made, which are used as an earth drum to increase the sound of the pressing of the Soma with the stones. Over the holes, which at the foot are not separated, are placed the pressing-boards, and over them again the skin on which the stones are placed. The earth thrown up from the pit serves to make six fire hearths or Dhiṣṇyas, which extend from south to north, and are appropriated to the Maitrāvaruņa, Hotṛ, Brāhmaṇāc- chansin, Potr, Neştṛ and Achāvāka. Outside the Sadas, on the right side of the Vedi, is the Mārjālīya hearth, used for cleansing the utensils, and opposite it the hut for the Agnidhriya fire. 

The offering of the victim to Agni and Soma is the occasion of an interest- ing rite the sons, grandsons, and relatives of the sacrificer are invited to assist in it the Adhvaryu takes hold of the sacrificer, the wife of the Adhvaryu, of her the sons, of them the grandchildren, and of them the relatives, thus presenting a picture of family ritual, which is the more note- worthy in that it is not connected as usual with the worship of the dead. The whole body set themselves in procession to the Agnidhriya and the Ahavaniya to the recitation of verses for the bringing forward of Agni and Soma. Before the offering is actually made, the Avantaradīkṣā comes to an end. The sacrificer unloosens his girdle, lets go his fist, and gives up the restrictions hitherto imposed on him. The victim is then offered, and the waters for use are drawn in some place shadowed from the sun, while the cows are milked, and the sacrificer spends the night awake and guarding the Soma. 

The early dawn of the next day sees the service commenced by the per- formance of the Prātaranuvāka, morning litany ', addressed to Agni, the Dawn, and the AŚvins: the rule according to some texts is that the recitation is to be kept up from very early in the morning to the break of day. At the same time cakes are made ready for offerings to Indra Harivant, Indra and Puşan, Sarasvati, Bharati, Indra, and Mitra and Varuna. Then comes the ceremony of fetching waters for use in the mixing of the Soma. 

The pressing of the Soma may be preceded by the offering of cups of curds, butter, or Soma, in which case a few stalks only are pressed in the Vājapeya and the Rājasūya there are also the AnŚu and Adābhya cups, the first of sour milk merely touched with Soma stalks, the latter of Soma. The great pressing is preceded by the UpañŚusavana which provides Soma for the UpanŚu cup. The pressing takes place in three rounds: the Adhvaryu, Pratiprasthātṛ, and Unnetṛ are the performers: the juice is poured into the Adhavaniya vessel, which is filled with water, and is then passed through a sieve to the wooden tub. The Unnetṛ draws Soma from the Adhavaniya with a vessel, and pours it into the Hotṛ's cup, and the sacrificer then pours from it an unbroken stream on the sieve from which the next cups are drawn

for offering, the Antaryāma, Aindravāyava, Maitrāvaruņa, Śukra, Manthin, Agrayana, Ukthya, and Dhruva, which, therefore, are called Dhārāgrahas, as opposed to the other cups, which are made full from the wooden tub with the vessel called Pariplava. The rest of the Soma is placed in the Pūtabhṛt vessel, except a part needed to fill the goblets, Camasas, of the priests. After libations to atone for loss of drops of Soma, the Bahiṣpavamāna Stotra is performed by the priests to accompany the purifying of the Soma: it is repeated outside the Sadas. The priests creep to the performance of this Stotra, each holding the previous one,1 and the Adhvaryu starts the perform- ance by handing to the Prastotṛ a handful of Darbha grass, which the latter hands to the Udgatṛ, asking the Brahman's authority to begin. The song is duly sung, the AŚvina cup is offered, and the victims sacrificed, and a cake offering is made in accordance with the preparation of the early morning. The cups for the double deities, Indra and Vayu, Mitra and Varuna, and the AŚvins, are then offered; then are filled the goblets of the priests, and offerings of the Śukra and Manthin cups made for the strange figures of Śanda and Marka. The oblations are made from the cups of the priests by the Adhvaryu, and the priests partake of the remainder. The emptied cups are now filled again and placed under the back part of the southern Soma cart, receiving the name NārāŚansa and being allotted to the Fathers as Avamas, Ūrvas, and Kavyas. The Achāvāka hereupon makes his appearance, and, if the Hotṛ consents to allow this late innovation among the priests to have a share in the rite, he is given a portion of the cake; then follow 12 or 14 season offerings and then the Hotṛ recites his Ajya Śastra, the contents of which have already been given. The end of the Castra is marked by the offering and partaking of the cup of Soma and the NārāŚansa cups are also partaken of, but not offered. From them is taken a cup for the All-gods, and then follows the second Stotra, followed by the Praüga Śastra of the Hotṛ; the cup is offered and partaken of with the NārāŚansas as before. Then a third of the Ukthya is taken for each of Mitra and Varuna, Indra, and Indra and Agni respectively, and used as the libations for the Stotras and Castras, three in number, which end the pressing: the Castras are recited by the Maiträvaruṇa, Brāhmaṇāc- chansin, and Achāvāka. 

The midday pressing follows mainly the form of that of the morning: the season cups and those for two deities are omitted, and a new priest appears in the shape of the Grāvastut, 'praiser of the stones', whose business it is to say the verses addressed to the pressing stones, and who during his work keeps his head covered in a cloth lent to him by the sacrificer. The Śukra and Manthin, the Agrayana, the two Marutvatiyas, and the Ukthya before or between them form the cups for the midday pressing. The Bahiṣpavamāna is represented by

the Madhyandinapavamana Stotra. At the end of it there is the place of the preparation of the drink of hot sour milk, the Dadhigharma, which is proved to have existed even in the time of the Rigveda. Then come the cake offering, the filling of the goblets, the offering of the Śukra and Manthin cups, and the further ceremonies down to the depositing of the NārāŚansa cups, after which the fees should be given, consisting of 7, 21, 60 to 1,000 cattle, or all the sacrificer's goods save his eldest son. In case of these two highest numbers he must also give a mule, for some uncertain cause. The sacrificer divides his largesse, cattle, sheep, horses, elephants, servants, clothes, in four heaps, the Adhvaryu has one share, out of which portions are obtained by the Prati- prasthatṛ, the Nestṛ and Unnetṛ, of a half, a third, and fourth respectively of the Adhvaryu's share, and so with the other priests. An Atreya is given a gold gift in addition: Kanvas, KaŚyapas, and ignorant Brahmans get nothing even a daughter may be given in the form of marriage known as daiva, divine'. After the fees are received two Marutvatiya cups are offered, and then a third which is the occasion of the Marutvatiya Śastra of the Hotṛ. Then a libation is made to Mahendra, which is accompanied by the first Prstha Stotra of the Saman singers, and the Niskevalya Śastra of the Hotṛ. Three Atigrahyas are offered at the same time, for Agni, Indra, and Sürya. Then follows as in the morning three Ukthya cups with the second to fourth Prstha Stotras and the three Castras of the Maiträvaruņa, Brāh- maṇacchansin, and Achāvāka.

: 

The evening pressing is intended by an Aditya cup, which is the means of producing magic effects according as it is prepared. It is made out of the remains of the cups for two deities, and is made ready, when both doors of the hut of the Soma carts are closed. The main pressing is much as in the morning, but the old Soma shoots are used as well as new. The Agrayaṇa is performed with four streams, not three as at midday, or two as at the morning. The Arbhavapavamāna Stotra is followed by the proceeding with the un- finished animal offering, then the cake offering takes place, and the rest goes on as at midday until the NaraŚansa cups are disposed of. There follows a libation in which the Fathers are referred to. After that the Săvitra cup is offered, and thereafter the VaiŚvadeva cup which gives rise to the VaiŚvadeva Śastra. Now a pap is offered: and the Udgātṛs look at themselves in butter. Then a Pātnivata cup is offered, in connexion with which the Agnidh sits on the lap of the Neştṛr, who fetches thereafter the wife of the sacrificer. The Adhvaryu starts the Yajñāyajñīya Sāman, the sacrificer repeats the formula called Saptahotṛ, the Neştṛ causes the wife to be looked at by the Udgatṛ, and she pours along her thigh water. Then follows the Agnimaruta Śastra. With this the rite is drawing to a close: the main sacrifice is completed, the Hariyo- jana cup is offered, and finally there is the Avabhṛtha in which many of the utensils are thrown into the water; the sacrificer and his wife have a bath, and put on new clothes. There still, however, have to be performed an Udayaniyā 'On Vedic marriage cf. Macdonell and Keith, Vedic Index, ii. 479 ff.Chap. 20]

offering, the sacrifice of a barren cow to Mitra and Varuna, for which the Bahvṛcas substitute a mere milk offering, an offering to the minor deities, or in the case of a king to the divine impellers, and the burning of the strew and other minor rites, and at last an Udavasaniya offering. 

There can be no doubt whatever as to the great part played by Indra in the Soma offering: the midday pressing is almost entirely his, the Maruts appearing only in his company, though at the evening pressing his place is comparatively slight. In the morning we find in the Prauga Śastra, which is certainly to be traced to the Rigveda, invocations of seven sets of gods, first Vayu, then Indra and Vayu, Mitra and Varuna, the AŚvins, Indra, the All- gods, and Sarasvati, while the three litanies of the assistants of the Hotṛ are devoted to Mitra and Varuna, Indra, and Indra and Agni. In the evening the ritual finds places for the Adityas, Savitṛ, the All-gods, Agni with the wives of the gods, and Indra with the bay steeds. The Rbhus thus play a very minor part, though they have verses and though their old importance, which is asserted in the Rigveda, may be traced in the name of the Arbhavapavamāna Stotra. In the case of the Adityas we have evidence in the Rigveda of their having a share in the offering, and so also in the case of Agni and the Maruts, but so comparatively seldom as to show that the position of these gods was distinctly far from assured as regards their share in the Soma sacrifice. The wives of the gods are also mentioned in the Rigveda as having a part, but never Savitṛ, a fact which is doubtless fair evidence that the Rigveda did not know him as having a place in the rite, and that he was later brought in, per- haps because of his growing importance, perhaps as an Aditya. The position of Agni also in the rite is a proof that he was not at first one of the great Soma drinkers he appears in it in the main as connected with Indra, or as one of many other gods. On the other hand, the evidence of the Rigveda forbids the adoption of the view that the Soma offering was originally given to Indra alone: if that were the case it lies in times beyond our possibility of knowledge. The exclusion of Rudra, which seems, however, to be post-Rigvedic, though it is marked in the ritual, is the obvious result of his hostile nature.1 

In some places it is clear enough that the Soma sacrifice was considered as a rain spell: 2 the pressing of the juice from the plant, and the pouring of the water and the juice through the sieve, are sufficient in themselves to import a rain spell of the normal Vedic type, and there can be no doubt that this view explains the fact that Soma is often regarded as a rain bringer, though doubt- less in part that idea may be merely an extension of the practice of applying to any great god all the powers, which are important to man. But to go so far as to suggest, as Hillebrandt does, that the essence of the sacrifice was a piece of magic, the moon's rays being full of nectar and being represented by the shoots of the Soma plant, so that the manipulations of the priests are

adequate to supply the gods with the nectar drink which they love, is to misunderstand the nature of the sacrifice completely, and further the whole idea is vitiated by the assumption which the author has never proved nor even made plausible that Soma in the Rigveda is the moon. Nor, as we have seen, is there any real possibility of proving that the Soma offering has any totem- istic flavour it can be shown to be nothing but the offering to the god of the intoxicating drink, which in itself, on the other hand, creates the conception of the god Soma, who later and only among the Brahmans in the first instance is by the exercise of creative fancy equated with the moon.1 

An ingenious but implausible suggestion is that of von Schroeder, who, 

2 

accepting as primitive the connexion of Soma with the moon, holds that the purpose of the rite was to enable the sacrificer to assimilate in the form of a symbol of the moon the strength of the moon itself, just as in the Pravargya ceremony we may see the sacrificer acquiring the strength of the sun by drinking the hot milk, which is as naturally offered to the sun as is Soma to the moon. There is, however, clearly no positive evidence to support these suggestions as representing primitive views of either offering.

## 09. The Pravargya or Hot-milk Sacrifice 

In the Soma sacrifice the Pravargya is inserted by the ritual text-books as an element which is to be performed twice a day in the course of the Upasad days, giving, with the normal three Upasads, six performances. But there is great doubt as to whether the rite is necessary, or whether it should be per- formed also at the first Agnistoma, or not until after one has been performed. The discrepancy of opinion suggests that the rite was originally a separate sacrifice altogether, and this is borne out by the Rigveda, where it seems to have been an offering made in the morning only. From clay chosen from a pit east of the Ahavaniya fire, to which a horse leads the way, a Mahāvīra pot is made, a span high, two spare pots, and various other utensils. A stool of Muñja grass is also made as a throne for the pot. The pot is heated, the milk of a cow and a goat is poured in. Finally, the hot drink is offered to the AŚvins, and two Rauhiņa cakes are also offered in the morning to the day, in the evening to the night. At the outset of the ceremony the wife of the sacrificer is made to cover her head, but she joins with the rest at the close in the finale of the Saman which is sung. At the end the offering utensils are arranged so as to make up the semblance of a man, the three Mahāvīra

Hubert and Mauss (Année sociol. ii. 129, 180) see in the rite the birth and death of the god, but in this case as usual they read into the rite much more than even what the Brahmanas see as a pure speculation: we have no right whatever to regard this view as primitive or popular.

vessels marking the head, and so on. There are as usual prescriptions for the various accidents which may happen in the course of the rite, and, when it is performed, the sacrificer for a year eats no food, has intercourse with no woman of a certain class, and drinks from no earthen vessel. Moreover, for a year before the offering the same taboos should be observed and the rite studied in advance. 

3 

The rite is explained by the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 1 as a mystic union of the gods which provides a new body for the sacrificer, and this theory is accepted by Geldner, who regards it as an allegory of sexual union generally. This is not an attractive explanation: the explanation of the Mahāvīra pot as a symbol of the Linga is wholly unsupported by a single word in the formulae, and the explanations of the Brahmanas are always to be taken with the utmost care. On the other hand, we have clear suggestions in other passages that the rite, which is one of a specially dangerous, that is, sacred type,' was understood as a sun spell, and this is directly indicated by the formulae used at the rite. The pot is covered with a golden plate, which can be nothing else than a symbol of fire or the sun, the pot glows, the milk, which in its whiteness is a sun symbol, boils with heat. The sacrificer by drinking as usual a share of the milk thus gains power at the same time as the sun is strengthened. Nor is there any objection to the fact that the offering is made to the AŚvins: the turning of magic into prayer and sacrifice is a constant feature of the Vedic ritual, parallel to the turning of prayer and sacrifice into magic, and, once the rite existed, the idea of presenting the milk to the AŚvins, the harbingers of morning, was almost inevitable." 

Mystically the rite seems in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 5 to have been inter- preted in the sense that the pot was the sun, the milk the divine flood of life and light which falls to the sacrificer: as the sun is the head of the universe, so the pot is the head of the sacrificer: the rite provides the sacrificer and the universe alike with a head. Hence the deep reverence paid to the pot, and its optional character in the rite, since the Soma sacrifice by itself would confer the same blessings. The Aitareya Brāhmaṇa holds that it must not be performed until after a Soma sacrifice, a view which is explained by the Kauṣitaki Brāhmaṇa which requires that the body of the sacrificer should be first completed by the Soma sacrifice, and so made able to receive a head.

for the one victim there prescribed. In that case the ceremony is lengthened by the performance for each of the victims of the formal rite of the slaying, &c.: the general parts, such as the fore-offerings, are not repeated for each. Thirteen posts are used in place of one: the twelfth, the UpaŚaya, is not set up, and the thirteenth is reserved under the name of Patnivata for an offering at the end of the ceremony. The middlemost post is placed near the fire, then one on either side, the rule being that the height increases from north to south: the UpaŚaya is bound round with two cords, and placed at the southern post with maledictions on an enemy. To the centre post is tied the victim for Agni, north to it the sheep for Sarasvati, south the goat for Soma, and so on, ending with the victim for Varuna on the south: mentally a beast of the wild, such as a mole, is attributed to the UpaŚaya. After the offering of the omentum of the Anubandhya cow, preparations are made for an offering of a victim to Tvaştr at the Patnivata post, but the victim, which must be reddish brown, after the carrying round of fire is allowed to go free, being replaced by butter, with the offering of which the rite ends, unless it is stopped sooner at the carrying round of the fire. 

## 11. Other Forms of Jyotiṣṭoma 

The ritual texts rank the Agniṣṭoma as the first form of the series of Soma sacrifices which bear the generic title of Jyotiṣṭoma. The list is in their view the Atyagnistoma, the Ukthya, the SodaŚin, the Vajapeya, Atiratra, and Aptoryama or Aptoryama. The number of the series is seven, and it is most probable that the number is simply the sacred seven, and not a trace of an original view. The Atyagniṣṭoma, the Vajapeya, and the Aptoryāma have not the place of forms of the Jyotisțoma in the older Samhitas, and probably were added to make up the number to seven.1 

The essential distinction of the Ukthya from the Agnistoma lies in the fact, that at the third pressing of the Soma the number of Śastras and of Stotras is brought up to five each by the addition of three others, so as to correspond with the five of each which are found in the other two pressings. The Stotras and Śastras accompany the rounds of goblets at the other pressings. Further, the Castras bear the name Uktha or Ukthya of the Ukthya cups which are given to Indra and Varuna, Indra and Bṛhaspati, and Indra and Visņu, and not to the same deities as at the morning and afternoon pressings. The name of the sacrifice is of obscure origin: the more probable view is that it was so called, because there was a discussion as to whether the Ukthya cup in its three portions was to be used at the third pressing: the question would then be a disputed one and the sacrifice, in which they were used, would be called that with the Ukthya or more shortly Ukthya. The Samans of the extra

335 

Stotras seem to have been the SakamaŚva, Saubhara, and Narmedha. A further difference lies in the fact that there is a change of Samans at the Pṛṣṭha Stotras of the mid-day pressing: in the first and the third of these the Bṛhat and Cyaita replace the Rathantara and Naudhasa, while the second and the fourth retain the old Samans, Vāmadevya and Kaleya. There is also a second victim, a he-goat for Indra and Agni, for the day of the pressing. 

1 

The SodaŚin 1 differs from the preceding rite by the addition of a ram for Indra, and by the possession of a sixteenth cup, which is offered at the morning pressing or at all three, as the last of the Dharagrahas. It is accompanied by a special Stotra and Śastra making the number up to sixteen, with the fifteen of the Ukthya, and, in accordance with this increase, there are also four sets of goblets in place of three as at the Ukthya. The Soma cow has to be of very small stature and have red ears. The SodaŚin cup is treated with special care it is placed in a square vessel of Khadira wood, addressed as soon as it is put on the Vedi, and, in giving the signal for the commencement of the Stotra when the sun is half set, a gold piece is handed to the Udgătṛ in place of the usual piece of grass. The sacrificial fee is a reddish brown horse or a female mule. 

The Atyagniṣṭoma is closely connected with the SoḍaŚin, though in the view of the ritual texts it is treated as if it were simply an Agniṣṭoma with an extra Stotra and Śastra. It is really a SoḍaŚin in which the three Stotras and Śastras of the Ukthya, and of course the corresponding goblets and Ukthya cup, are omitted. Its real place in the ritual is not as a separate sacrifice at all, but as the form of service on the tenth day of a DaŚaratra, a period of ten days, which with an Atirātra before and after it makes up the common form of a DvadaŚaha rite: it must in all probability be treated as a variant form, pro- duced by those theologians who did not approve the addition of the three Stotras and Castras at the Ukthya rite. 

The Atiratra attains the number of twenty-nine Stotras and Śastras by adding a series of twelve of both, which are used to accompany three rounds, Paryayas, each of four sets of goblets, which in turn are led off by that of the Hotṛ, Maiträvaruṇa, Brāhmaṇacchansin, and Achāvāka. The offerings are made during this nocturnal carouse, which gives the name to the rite, to Indra ApiŚarvara. When the cups have been duly offered and the priests have drunk, then the Sandhi Stotra is performed, while a cake is made ready for the AŚvins, the name of the Stotra being derived from the twilight, which is about to break. It has nine verses and is sung to the Rathantara tune. Then follows the Prataranuvāka to the AŚvins, which must contain a thousand verses or more, or a thousand Bṛhati verses, made up artificially from other metres : the last verse is to be said after sunrise. Then the Adhvaryu takes the cup of the Hotṛ, the other assistants of the Adhvaryu the rest, and with the Soma

[Part III 

from the previous night, a cup is offered to the AŚvins, while the Pratiprasthātṛ offers the cake. There is also a fourth animal victim, a he-goat for Sarasvati. 

The Atirātra might, it is clear, be performed without the SoḍaŚin cup and the corresponding Stotra and Castra, but this is not the prevailing view. It lasted with its nocturnal continuation over the night, and so can be considered as the tail of the sacrifice, which laps over from the end of the month into the next month.1 

The Aptoryāma is classed sometimes with the Atirātra as an Ahina, that is a rite lasting more than a day, instead of as an Ekaha like the other forms of the Jyotiṣṭoma. It is marked out from the Atiratra by the addition after the Sandhi Stotra and the AŚvina Śastra of four more Stotras and Castras, accompanying four sets of goblets for the priests which are drawn for Agni, Indra, the All-gods, and Visņu, or according to others for the deities of the Sandhi goblets. As an independent rite, it is practically unknown it is, however, occasionally mentioned with other forms of one day ceremonies. 

The last form of the Jyotiṣṭoma is the Vājapeya, which is of special nature and will be treated below. 

## 12. Other Soma Sacrifices of One Day's Duration.

The Agniṣṭoma is the model on which innumerable other kinds of sacrifice can be formed, in order to bring about certain desires. The Vicvajit is occasionally mentioned in it a man gives all his goods as the fee, or at least a thousand cattle and hundred horses. In the former case he first hands over to his eldest son his share in the property. After the offering he spends twelve nights in different places, three where an Udumbara is, eating fruits and roots only, three among Niṣādas, without eating the grains cultivated by them, three with folk, and three with folk like himself, or according to another view either VaiŚyas or Rajany... The symbolic nature of the rite is obvious. 

The six Sadyaḥkras are offerings which in one day include all the rites, including the Dikṣa from the beginning to the end of a Soma sacrifice. The first serves as a model of the rest: the priests, Hotṛ, Udgātṛ, Adhvaryu, and Brahman, are stationed in the four quarters at considerable distances: the altar is a sown field, or field full of ripe barley or rice: the Uttaravedi a threshing-floor. Milk is churned into butter in a skin by the primitive mode of shaking it. The offering is supposed to bring the attainment of heaven, of cattle, and of the defeat of a rival. The second removes disease, and brings strength and food. The fourth is the ViŚvajit Śilpa, at which one should give as many fees as possible; the fifth is the Cyena, which is employed for

exorcism, and the fee in this case consists of one-eyed lame cattle without horns or tails, mixed with diseased ones.1 

Of special importance are the four Vratya Stomas, which are rites. apparently intended for the admission into the Brahmanical community of persons who though Aryans have been living outside that community. It is in the ritual said to be intended for the case of persons who have lost their position as twice born by various reasons, including living among non-twice- born people. Of such people it is said that they do not study, do not practise agriculture or trade; they call good words bad, perhaps a reference to differ- ences of dialect, they punish the guiltless with blows, presumably an allusion to difference of law, and, though unconsecrated, speak the speech of the con- secrated. According to the views of Katyayana, the first offering is for Vratyas, who, skilled in dance, song, and music, are capable of teaching these arts to a company of Vratyas, the second for eunuchs, the third for those of little account, and the fourth for old impotent men. The dress of the Vratyas is described as including a special kind of turban (uşnişa), white garments with black fringes, and a curious kind of bow without a string (jyähroḍa): at the rite also is used a special sort of cart (vipatha), and a silver ornament as worn by Vratyas. The Gṛhapati, who is to be chosen from the leader of the Vratyas to be con- verted, carries two skins, one white, one black, and a pair of shoes,, black and shaped like ears, or provided with ears. All these articles are to be given as a fee at the proper time to an unworthy Brahman from Magadha, a sign that Magadha was not regarded as strictly Brahmanical, or to Vratyas who have not yet been converted, and who are thus made scapegoats. When the ceremony is over, the Vrätyas cease to have that characteristic: they become admitted to full membership of the Brahmanical society, and can engage in the pursuit of sacred learning. 

The rites are specially interesting, as they mention several words which are not easily explicable, and evidently were not well understood at a very early date they may be borrowed from the speech of the eastern tribes, and together with the mention of the Brahman from Magadha suggest, but do not prove, that the Vratyas came from the east rather than from the west, though we know that the western tribes were by no means fully Brahmanized,

* A rash hypothesis (cf. above, Chap. 1), based on late linguistic facts, and supported by worthless ethnological material, claims that the Vedic Indians were Aryans who entered their homes from Chitral and Gilgit and not directly connected with the Punjab (see e. g. Risley, People of India, pp. 55 ff.). The theory contradicts the evidence of the Rigveda, and the Chitral route, as Holdich (The Gates of India) insists, is impracticable for a people's migration. 

338 

Vedic Ritual 

[Part III 

and it has been suggested that the Vratyas represented one or other of the many Aryan tribes which were in motion in the period 1500-1000 B.C. There are clear traces that the Udgātrs were specially active in the business of bringing in these outlying members of the Brahmanical society: possibly this may stand in some relation to the fact that the Chandogas were never held in the highest repute among the Vedic Indians.1 The suggestion of Charpentier a that we are to see in these Vratyas adherents of Rudra-Śiva must be regarded as impossible. It is, however, of interest to note that already in the Athar- vaveda3 the Vratya is a well-known figure, and by the curious ideas of that Veda is turned into an expression of the supreme deity. 

2 

Of other rites of this class the Upahavya is interesting, as it is born of strife between the gods and the Asuras, and in it the names of the gods are carefully changed to avoid mentioning them aloud: thus the name of Indra is Śakra, of Soma Indu, and likewise the hotā deva is changed to hota yakṣe, and so on, even the simple word sarva, all, becoming the old viŚva. There is a rite, the Sarvasvāra, for one who wishes to die: the sacrificer in it is com- pletely covered over and sits facing south on a dark skin. In the Bṛhaspatisavɛ on the other hand, which is offered by one who wishes such rank as a Puro- hitaship, the sacrificer must be treated with respect, be greeted by others with- out returning the salutation, and be styled Sthapati, ‘lord', all these things by sympathetic magic working the desired end. If the Apacitis are offered to bring a man honour, he must pay dearly in Dakṣiņās in proportion to what he aspires to attain, and so in all these offerings the greed of the priest for fees shows itself. 

7 

The Gosava is of special interest, because it involves incest with one's mother, sister, and a woman of one's own Gotra, that is with whom marriage is forbidden. The Jaiminiya Brāhmaṇa records that Janaka of Videha declined to undertake it, though it would have secured him the world of the Ox, doubtless Prajapati as in the Atharvaveda," but a Śibi king did perform it, carrying out literally the rule of acting according to nature.

## 13. The Vajapeya or Drink-of-Strength 

The Vajapeya is of especial interest in that it preserves, despite the formalism imposed upon it by its inclusion in the Soma ritual, many traces of very popular origin. It is said by many authorities to be a festival of the autumn, and it is also allowed either to perform it independently, or as the sixth day of a Sarvamedha or universal sacrifice. It consists of one pressing day and at least 18 days of consecration and three Upasad days, so that it takes up at least 17 days and may be spun out to a year. It adds to the ordinary SoḍaŚin form a seventeenth Stotra and Castra, and the number seventeen is also introduced into the Bahiṣpavamāna and Madhyandinapa- vamāna Stotras in place of the Trivṛt and PañcadaŚa Stomas there normally used. The number of cups in the ordinary rite is increased by the addition of the AnŚu and Adabhya, and also five Vajapeya or Aindra cups; there are added a dappled barren cow for the Maruts, and seventeen goats for Prajapati, hornless but capable of procreation. The sacrificer, his wife, and the priest all wear garlands of gold, which form the fees. The special features of the rite begin with the midday pressing, at which a warrior with seventeen arrows measures out a course for a race, marking the place where the last falls with a twig of Udumbara. Then three horses of the sacrificer are yoked to his chariot, sixteen others are yoked with four horses each, and the sacrificer is victorious in a formal race, during which 17 drums are beaten, and the Brahman climbs up a post, on which is fastened a wheel of Udumbara wood, to sing the Saman of the strong steeds, while the wheel is turned to the right. The horses are given, before and after the race, the offering to Bṛhaspati to smell, to gain its strength. In the second place, along with the cups of Soma there are offered by the Neștṛ alternatively cups of Sura, which are purchased from a long-haired man and placed in a special place. Mention is also made of a cup 

of honey, which is not used for any offering, but is placed in the hand of a Kṣatriya or VaiŚya competitor, and seems to be an unintelligible remainder of an older rite. In the third place, the sacrificer for himself and his wife solemnly mounts to the sun by climbing with the aid of a ladder to the top of the sacrificial post which is decorated by placing on it a wheel-shaped garland of meal, in which position he is touched by the priest or others with salt in AŚvattha leaves. He then descends and sits on a throne, and is sprinkled with a mixture of water, milk, and seventeen other substances, or so many as can be thought of, with the exception of one of which he never again eats. The rest of the mixture is used for certain libations called Vajaprasaviya, and the festival closes with seventeen Ujjitis, benedictions, which can be accom- panied by libations.

The name of the offering is explained by tradition as food and drink', by Oldenberg1 as the drink of strength', and by Weber as the protection of strength'. The last rendering is clearly to be rejected: the drink which Weber denies to be seen in the offering is the Soma, and we cannot assume that the name is older than the use of Soma in the rite. It is important to note that the rite could, it is clear from scattered notices, be used by a VaiŚya and not merely by a Brahman or a Ksatriya, but it is also clear that the offering was connected with the attainment of high prosperity, and it may well be that it was intended to be offered only by one who was in the technical sense a gataŚrī, 'who had attained prosperity', and so could aspire to highest things. More- this is indicated by the fact that the person who performs this offering is not expected to take notice of persons who have not done so, go behind them, or share a bed with them. The nature of the rites is clearly on the one hand that of the attainment of victory and power by the symbolic acts of winning, of being hailed as victor, and anointing: references to fertility are obvious also, and the sun spell of the wheel is noteworthy. It is accordingly impossible to lay down precisely the original character of the rite: 2 it was not merely the feast of victory of the winner in a chariot race, such as might be paralleled in Greek ritual, nor was it solely an agricultural rite: it has been blended by a mixture of many elements to form a general offering available for any successful person.

This curious position of the Vajapeya clearly led to confusion: some texts place it above the Rajasuya, and say that by the latter mere kingship is con- ferred, by the former paramount lordship. But other texts make the Vajapeya appropriate for a paramount lord, and the Rājasuya for a universal monarch like Varuna. The simplest solution is that which makes the Vājapeya a rite which is performed by the king before the Rājasuya and by the Brahman before the Bṛhaspatisava. The essential priestly character of the rite as it stands is shown by the prominence of Bṛhaspati and the part played by Praja- pati.

Other special forms of sacrifices for obtaining a special rank are the Sūta, Grāmaṇī, Sthapati, and Go-Savas.5

The royal consecration is a Soma sacrifice having the usual Dikṣā and Upasad days and preceded by a long series of preparatory rites. It is mythi- cally connected with the consecration of Varuna or with Indra, and it

displays many popular elements in its character, as was inevitable from its nature. The great nobles and office bearers of the court play an important part, the Purohita performs many of the priestly functions, the people are at least present to hear the announcement of the consecration of the sovereign. It connects itself with Vedic history: the tribes who are mentioned are the Bharatas or their successors in blood and tradition, the Kuru-Pañcalas. The preliminary ceremonies begin with the first day of Dikṣā on the 1st Phalguna, followed by offerings to Anumati and to Nirṛti, who receives the fallen portions of the grain on a salt piece of ground in the south. With the 15th of the month commence the observances for a year of the four-month offerings, the periods between the new- and full-moon days being filled up either by the new- and full-moon offerings or offerings to the sun and the moon. These offerings cease with the Śunasiriya offering on the 1st Phalguna of the following year, and on that and the next two days offerings are made to the deities of the quarters, and others, and then on the 4th to the 15th offerings called the Ratninām Havinşi, which are offered in the houses of the jewels' of the king,1 his wives and high officers, the deities chosen being the appropriate gods for the persons in whose houses the offerings are made, as for Aditi in that of the chief queen, for Nirṛti in that of the discarded lady. After these follow various libations, and on the 1st of Caitra comes the day of anointing, which is per- formed as an Ukthya rite. There are offered on it eight offerings to the divine instigators, who are to pay heed to the crowning of the prince in the rite. The actual anointing takes place after the Marutvatiya cups: seventeen kinds of waters, brought from the Sarasvati, drawn against the current of the stream, or with it, &c., are used: they are sieved after mixing and poured into four vessels, of PalaŚa, Udumbara, Nyagrodha, and AŚvattha. The sacrificer clad in splendid raiment takes from the Adhvaryu a bow with three arrows, and is proclaimed with the Avid formulae which he repeats announcing his anointment. The evil spirits are appeased by the gift of copper placed in the mouth of a long-haired man. The sacrificer then strides to the various quarters, and steps on a tiger-skin, beneath which is a piece of lead, on which he tramps as on the head of Namuci. With gold under his feet and a gold fillet over his head, he is anointed by the Adhvaryu in front, and also by a kinsman, a Rajanya, and a VaiŚya, representing the whole people. After this are per- formed six Partha libations which are offered to correspond with six before the anointing; the king steps on the skin the steps of Viṣņu and puts in the

PalaŚa dish the remains of the mixture, which he hands to his eldest son, that he may continue his work and strength. An offering is also made in which the names of the father and son are first confused, then rightly said., A mimic expedition for booty is performed: the king in his chariot goes out against cattle of his kinsfolk: at the time of the fees he plunders them and they surrender their belongings: a third of their goods goes to the priest, a third to the drinkers of the DaŚapeya, and the owners are allowed to have a third back. But they also receive villages, and are called Rājanyas, but unworthy of anointing.1 In another account, which does not in this interesting way bring out the conception of the pretenders to the royal throne and their defeat, the king mounts his horse and advances to the quarters, a parallel to which is quoted from the ceremony of coronation of the King of Hungary. Before descending from the chariot which he mounts for the fray, the king puts on sandals of boar's hide, and prays neither to injure the earth, nor be injured by it, a clear allusion to his high sanctity. After the later KeŚavapaniya rite he never stands with bare feet on the ground. He then sits on a throne placed over the tiger-hide, and takes five dice from the Adhvaryu: the priest gently beats him from behind with sticks of pure trees, doubtless to expel any taint of ill. Before the dicing begins the Purohita hands the king a wooden sword, which he passes on to his brother, and through him it is taken by a man. who marks out the place for dicing, where a hut is erected. After the dicing, which is merely formal and which deliberately was so carried out as to make the king a victor, the sacrifice progresses to the normal end, but the bath is followed by an offering to Indra and Visņu of a special nature. Then comes the preparation for the DaŚapeya offering, for which the Dikṣa consists in ten Samsṛpām Havinşi. The offering itself seems to have been in origin an inde- pendent offering: it is performed on the 7th of Caitra: the performers must have ten generations of Soma drinkers: from ten cups ten drink together at each it is uncertain if the relatives of the king may drink or not, but he certainly has a goblet. After this, according to some authorities, the king, the people save the Brahmans, and the steeds may not have their hair cut for a year. There are also a number of minor offerings to propitiate the quarters, to

win the seasons, for Aditi or the Adityas, and the Maruts or the All-gods. In Jyaiṣṭha follows in the next year the ceremony of the cutting of the hair, the KeŚavapaniya, which may be followed by two Vyuşți offerings a fortnight later, and the Kṣatradhṛti, a month later, a rite interesting as it is connected with the ruin of the Kurus. The fees are exaggerated beyond measure, 

even 240,000 cows being given. 

The rite is full of magic and symbolism: its nature is obvious and has in- numerable parallels: it is worth noting that the king is expected to rub in the substance of the anointing mixture with the horn of a black antelope: it is thus clear that the holy strength is actually in the mixture, and must be made to impregnate the system; the keeping of the long hair, like the Frankish kings, is to preserve for a time this holiness. The position and prominence of the game of dice 2 are interesting: it is possible to see in it a connexion with the foretelling of prosperity, but it must have been made the more natural in that the king was interested, we may believe even at this period, in the revenue to be derived from dicing, which was carried on in the Sabha, house of assembly', and which in later times was assuredly a valuable monopoly, and probably so in earlier days. 

+ 

Different forms of consecration are referred to: the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 3 distinguishes the great consecration, Abhiseka, of Indra from the renewed con- secration of a consecrated king, and its account of the consecration, which deals only with the anointing, differs very greatly from that of the Yajurveda, which it possibly presupposes. Great stress is laid on the fact that the king is only given a curious mixture to drink, being absolutely denied the use of Soma, a fact explained by a long mythological story. 

## 15. The Horse Sacrifice 

The horse sacrifice is in the ritual reckoned an Ahina, that is a rite with more than one day on which the Soma is pressed, in this case three. It is an old and famous rite, which kings alone can bring, to increase their realms: we have lists of the great kings of old 5 who were consecrated and who performed the horse sacrifice. The horse chosen must be swift, in front black, behind white, and with a dark mark. The offering begins on the 8th or 9th of Phalguna or in summer. On that day a mess of rice is cooked for the priests, and the king, his four wives, and their four hundred maidens of different ranks

assemble, the king spending the night at the Garhapatya fire. Next morning the horse is bound, and sprinkled in standing water: a man of low class kills with a club of Sidhraka wood a four-eyed dog, and lets it float on a mat under the horse. The sacrificer says, ' He who will kill the horse attacks Varuna: away the man, away the horse!' The horse is then led back to the fire, and offerings are made of cakes to Savitṛ in various forms for three days. The horse is then set free to wander with a hundred old horses, and guarded by four hundred youths of the same relative rank as the ladies of the queen, who are armed with armour, with swords, arrows, or sticks according to their rank, as princes, warriors, sons of heralds and headmen, and sons of atten- dants and charioteers. They must guard the horse from any danger, in- cluding bathing and intercourse with mares, doubtless acts calculated to reduce its sanctity of power. The princes among them are promised the royal consecration as the reward for success. If any ill fall upon the horse, it must be atoned for: if it dies, a new horse is found and some ceremonies repeated. During the period of its absence the priests and the sacrificer sit on golden thrones: the Hotṛ begins the telling of the cyclic 2 narrative, Pariplava Akhyāna, the telling of tales, Akhyānas, of ancient kings, which last by series of ten days for the whole year. At the end of the performance the Adhvaryu offers in the Dakṣina fire libations for the movements of the steed, and in the Ahavaniya, after sunset, the Dhṛti libations to secure the success of the rite at his bidding a lute player, a Rajanya, sings to the lute three Gāthās, verses, made by himself which refer to victories in battle connected with the sacrificer. All the performances repeat themselves daily for a year, or six months, or even for half a month, if the period is reduced. When the horse returns, the king, who has been celebrated hitherto with the kings of the past, is from the Dikṣā day of the new sacrifice hailed as with the gods, and on the three pressing days proper with Prajapati. The first pressing day falls on the full moon of VaiŚakha: there are 21 posts and 21 victims for Agni and Soma: on the days of pressing the victims are two sets of eleven each. The second pressing day is the most important. The Stotra is started at the neighing of a horse in the morning after the Śastra of the Hotṛ, three other horses are yoked with the sacrificial horse, and are driven to bathe. On the return of the horses the victim is anointed by the chief of the queens, and 101 gold pieces placed in its mane and tail. It is given the remains of an offering made the previous night; but, if it will not eat them, they are cast into water. Then take place curious riddles between the Brahman and the Hotṛ, the Brahmodya. Then the victims are bound to the posts, in all 327 or 349 tame animals and a large number of wild animals from the elephant to the bee,

making 609 in one version. The large numbers, especially of the wild animals, which were, however, to be let go after the fire had been carried round them, are suspicious: the best defence 1 to be made is that there was need of large numbers for the festival to follow the sacrifice. The horse is covered with a garment and slain: the queens go round it from left to right thrice, and thrice vice versa: the chief queen goes near the horse: both are covered with a garment, and the queen unites with it: meanwhile the priest and the maidens and the other wives indulge in ribald dialogue. Then the horse and the other victims are cut up. The blood is cooked, the omentum offering of the ordinary ritual prepared before it another Brahmodya between Hotṛ and Adhvaryu, Brahman and Udgatṛ, sacrificer and Adhvaryu, takes place. The rest of the horse is cooked, the blood offered at the end of the Sviṣṭakṛt offering and also on other occasions. Before the Sviṣṭakṛt offering the cooked flesh is offered to Prajapati, and at the end of the second day offerings are made, through the night, of various plants. 

The offerings of the third day are followed by the final bath, in which is performed the curious rite of an offering on the head of a man already referred to." The fees are given in various forms: the conquered land is to be divided: even the wives of the sacrificer are sometimes demanded the Adhvaryu apparently obtains a daughter in wedlock, and also the fourth wife. 

3 

The Rigveda clearly knows this greatest of all Vedic sacrifices, though it is certain that the holocaust of victims was not then usual; only a goat appears to lead the way for the horse, and, though this is not conclusive, still it makes it doubtful whether the early ritual had the large number of victims offered. The victims too seem to be led round the fire, not vice versa. But it is clear that the offering was already a Soma sacrifice, and that in essence the rite was known reference is also made to the use of gold and the cloths for decking the steed. 

4 

The meaning of the sacrifice is in the former view of Oldenberg * the offering to Indra, the god of the warriors, of a swift strong steed from which the sacrificer would thus derive magic power, whether directly or indirectly through the fact that Indra would thus be made strong to aid him. The slaying of the dog he thinks intended as the destruction of hostile powers, or perhaps in origin as providing the horse with a guardian; such a function is sometimes given to a four-eyed dog in the Avesta. The relation of the queen and the horse is clearly a fertility spell, while the obscene language, he thinks, might be explained in the same sense, or as an amusement of the gods, or a

mere relic of the plain speech of the crowd. In the view of Eggeling 1 the horse, the next animal to man in the scale, is the appropriate offering on great occasions at the sacrifice the steed can be identified with Prajapati, and so Prajapati comes properly into the ritual. On the other hand he points out that the horse is connected with Varuna, in that the horse is the sun horse which traverses the heaven, which is Varuna and is conceived as a sea of waters, so that the horse is sprung from the waters. Varuņa may, therefore, have been the carlier deity of the offering. 

The original force of the rite is somewhat obscure. The possibility of comparison with the October horse at Rome 2 is obvious, and the eating of the horse, the fertility rite in which it appears, and the obscenity of the conversa- tion, point to a vegetation ritual, but the absence of any suggestion that the horse was a vegetation spirit, or that its body was in part used for a direct vegetation magic, is against that theory. In the view of von Negelein,* the offering was one made to the sun conceived as a steed, in order to strengthen him for his course in the heaven. As Indra with his steed defeats the Asuras, so the carthly king by the horse sacrifice, uniting himself mysteriously with the sacrificial horse and its magic power, defeats the Asuras. Indra's horse is the thunderbolt which slays Vṛtra, and so the human horse aids the king to defeat his enemies. Varuna then, and later Prajapati, were given by tradition the ownership of the horse, first connected with Indra. The difficulty of this theory is to see exactly why the horse is connected with Indra. He is not the sun in Vedic and probably not even in pre-Vedic myth. On the other hand Varuna is the god of the waters par excellence: the waters in many lands are conceived as horses, both sca and fresh waters being so regarded: to rivers and the sea horses are offered as in Greece: Indra would then not be the primary figure in the myth as von Negelein holds, but a natural intruder in the rite. The most attractive alternative to this view is undoubtedly the acceptance of the sun as the sun horse, offered originally to the sun as a spell to strengthen it, and the chief difficulty in that view is merely the fact that the sun is not the recipient of the offering, in any measure. If he were actually offered to, it

would be easy to understand the place of Indra: that Indra should have com- pletely superseded him is odd, but on the whole the explanation of the horse as the sun steed seems the most plausible. It is at least certain that in the Vajasaneyi Samhita the steed was regarded in the rite as identical with Dadhikrävan whose sun character is not to be doubted.1 Perhaps the true solution lies in the view that two rites are confused, the offering of a horse to the sun and of a horse to Varuna as god of the waters. Prajapati must in any case be deemed to be a later addition to the rite. It is of course possible that the position of Varuna was not won until after he had become prominent in the ritual of the final bath, and that then he appropriated in part the sacrifice of the steed.

## 16. The Human Sacrifice 

The human sacrifice as prescribed in two of the ritual texts 2 is based closely on the horse sacrifice; while there the chief victims are the horse, a Gomṛga, and a hornless goat, here a man is added, a Brahman or Kṣatriya bought at the price of a thousand cows and a hundred cattle, and he is per- mitted like the horse a year of freedom, in which he can do as he wishes, save that he must remain chaste. The offering is to be performed by a Brahman or a Kṣatriya who is not successful. When slain, the chief queen must lie beside the victim as beside the horse: the attempt to find a reference to this practice in the Rigveda 3 is a failure. On the other hand the nominal offering of large numbers of other men, 166 at 11 posts, is mentioned by the Catapatha Brāhmaṇa, but we have every reason to assume that this is mere priestly imagination, unless, as is possible, the conceptions of the priest were occa- sionally made real by a king. It is laid down 5 that a king may on this occasion give up his goods and enter into the life of the wandering mendicant, but this seems merely to have been a facultative rule. It must, however, be noted that the rite of an actual slaying of man is not described in the Brāhmaṇas at all: there is in the Śatapatha and the Taittiriya and their Sūtras merely the symbolic offering of men, who are let free like the wild animals at the horse sacrifice, and therefore the actual offering rests merely on Sūtra evidence, the Vaitāna and Śãñkhāyana, and not even on the early Sutras. It is not credible that the Brāhmaṇas should have passed over the rite if they had actually known of it; its mention in the later Sutras is consistent only with the invention of it, as a reasonable complement to the theory of sacrifice which saw an anomaly in the omission of man from the victims.

Vedic Ritual 

[Part III 

No other trace of human sacrifice exists in the Vedic literature apart from the quite different case of the use of a man and four other victims as an offering at the piling of the great fire altar.1 This usage is not actually laid down for the contemporary time by any Brähmaņa: the most contemplated is the use of the head of a man who has been slain by lightning or by an arrow shot, not a victim killed for the purpose, and normally the head of a goat seems to have sufficed. But it is clearly no real sacrifice at all. The legend of ŚunahŚepa, which has been thought to embody an old legend of human sacrifice which was later abolished, and for which the recitation of the story suffices when recited to the king at the royal consecration, has been noted above; its essential feature of the horror of the proposed offering, whether the victim is the son of the king or merely a priest, and the view thus taken is quite incompatible with the idea that the actual human sacrifice was per- formed in Vedic India.2 

## 17. Other Ahina Rites 

While the human sacrifice occupies five pressing days, the universal sacri- fice, Sarvamedha,3 takes ten, and it is modelled on the offering made of him- self by Brahman Svayambhu, in the beginning of things. Its relation to the human sacrifice is held to be the perfection of the former at the human sacrifice, according to Śañkhāyana, the offerer gives away the kingdom with the people at this he gives the earth away also, and in Hillebrandt's view the rite marked the act by which the king left the royal life for the ascetic, as the Buddha afterwards did. It is, however, difficult to take the offering seriously it is based on myth, and seems no more than a purely priestly fiction this is borne out by the fact that it is mentioned only in the latest Sutras, though it figures in the legend of Naciketas. 

There are many other forms of the Ahina rite, with more than one and not more than twelve pressing days, making up at most with the Upasads, &c., not over a month. The number of variations is very large indeed, and the different forms are given names, according to the families or individuals who invented or practised them. Of their make-up the most important rule is that they must end with an Atiratra rite, and in all the days of the Abhiplava and Pṛṣṭhya Sadahas are usually brought into account of these further particu- lars will be given below. 

Apart, however, from mere priestly inventions, there are clear traces of popular rites: the most interesting is the Śabalihoma, performed in spring to increase the herds. The sacrificer cuts hair and beard, puts on an unused

garment, lies twelve nights on an uncovered elevated spot, and drinks hot milk. The fire in his house must be kept burning: no one, save a friend to give him the directions to perform his functions, must accompany him: he must say little and keep close. On the morning of the twelfth day he offers a libation of honey and sour milk with a formula addressed to Śabali. Before the voices of beings are heard, he goes from the village to a wood where he can hear none of the sounds of the village animals, takes a bunch of grass and cries thrice with loud voice' Śabali': if any animal other than a dog or an ass replies, his sacrifice will be successful. If no answer comes he repeats the performance a year later; if, however, at the third time there is no reply, or an ass or dog answers his first appeal, he will have no success. In the view of Henry,1 Śabali is the personified cloud, of varied hue, whose purpose can be expressed by the cow rich in milk. Originally a rain spell, the rite was developed for more general purposes. The PañcavinŚa Brāhmaṇa, however, treats Śabali, the wonder cow, as representing Vac, speech. 

## 18. The Sattras or Sacrificial Sessions 

8 

The rite of twelve days, DvadaŚaha, may be performed either as an Ahina or a Sattra, and all rites with more than twelve pressing days are Sattras the number of years they may be continued extends to thirty-six or more up to 1,000. The Sattras all differ from other forms of the Soma sacrifice, because all the performers must be consecrated and must be Brah- mans there is therefore no separate sacrificer: all share in the benefits of the offering each bears the burden of his own errors, whereas at the ordinary sacrifice the sacrificer receives the benefit and the evil results of errors alike. Moreover, they should usually be Brahmans who perform the same kinds of rites, and have the same deity, Tanúnapāt or NaraŚañsa, at the Apri invoca- tion; if not, the deity of the majority is adopted. During the Sattra all other sacrifices cease to be performed by the priests taking part in the rite any sexual intercourse is forbidden, as are swift movements, laughing without holding the hand before the mouth, untruth, connexions with non-Aryans, and so forth. One of them plays the part of sacrificer: the others hold on to him when he does those acts which only one man can perform. The Adhvaryu consecrates the sacrificer, and so on until a student consecrates the Unnetr. The wives of the priests are also consecrated each with her husband. There are no fees instead the priests go south saying as they shake black skins, 'What here from my life departeth, that, O Agada, I bring to thee as a fee,' evidently a device to secure long life. The aims of the Sattras are most

various: the obtaining of wealth, of cattle, of offspring, of prosperous marriage, and many other things. Much as they are, it is clear, elaborated by the priest, they reflect here and there primitive conceptions of sacrifice. 

The model of all Sattras is the DvadaŚaha, which is made up of a Praya- niya and an Udayaniya, which, as in all Sattras as opposed to Ahinas, must both be Atirātra days, as the beginning and concluding rites respectively of a Prsthya Şaḍaha, and of either 4 Chandomas or 3 Chandomas and an Avivakya day as the tenth. The name Prsthya is based on the different treatment of the Pṛṣṭha Stotra of each day corresponding to the Castra of the Hotṛ on the first it is in the Rathantara tune, on the second the Bṛhat, the third the Vairupa, the fourth the Vairaja, the fifth the Śakvara, the sixth the Raivata. Of these days the first and fourth are Agnistomas, the others Ukthyas. The Chandomas are Ukthyas, the tenth is an Atyagnistoma: it is called Avivakya, because on that day no dispute about errors in the ceremony is allowed.1 A further variation is possible: on the fourth and ninth days the Agrayana cup may be drawn first, on the six and seventh the Śukra, in which case the Stotras and the Śastras must also be transposed, or they may be trans- posed without change in the order of the cups: this makes the period of ten days bear the term vyudhachandas. The Soma is daily watched by one priest, the rest may study the Veda, fetch wood, and eat. The tenth day is marked by interesting rites, the singing of the Saman called the success of the Sattra, and the performance of a Brahmodya like that at the horse offering or regarding the unqualified Prajāpati. 

Rules are given for building up the DvadaŚaha to longer Sattras; the simplest addition is that of a Mahāvrata day after the period of ten days: other additions are inserted before that period, the shorter before the longer. But these rules are very much varied in practice. Of the various forms by far the most interesting is the Gavām Ayana, the way of the cows', which is a Sattra of one year's duration. 

C 

The beginning of this Sattra 2 is variously prescribed, at the full moon of Phalguna or Caitra, or four days before the full moon of these months or of Magha. The middle day, the Vișuvant, divides it into two halves, of which the latter is in many respects intended to be the reverse of the former. The scheme of the offering is a Prayaṇīya Atirātra, a CaturvinŚa day on which the twenty-four-fold Stoma is used, the form being either an Agniṣṭoma or an Ukthya; five months each of four Abhiplava Sadahas and one Pṛṣṭhya ; a sixth one of one Pṛṣṭhya, three Abhiplavas, one Abhijit, an Agniṣṭoma rite, and three Svarasāman days making up 28, to which the first two days are added to complete the month. Then comes the Vișuvant. The second half- year has as the seventh month three Svarasamans, one ViŚvajit, one Pṛṣṭhya, and three Abhiplavas; then months 8 to 11 have one Pṛṣṭhya and four

Abhiplavas each, and the last has three Abhiplavas, one Ayus day, one Go day, one DaŚarātra, and the Mahāvrata and Udayaniya days. 

The Abhiplava Sadaha, which is often used in Sattras of all kinds and also in Ahinas, differs in certain respects from the Pṛṣṭhya. In the first place in it the Prstha Stotra is alternatively Rathantara and Bṛhat only. In the second place the days of the Abhiplava are differentiated as Jyotis, Go, and Ayus according to the Stomas used for the different Stotras. The Jyotis form, which is an Agniṣṭoma, having twelve Stotras only, employs for 1-6 the PañcadaŚa, for 7-11 the SaptadaŚa, and for 12 the EkavinŚa. The other two are Ukthyas and have fifteen Stotras: for 1 the Go uses the PañcadaŚa, for 2-5 the Trivṛt, for 6-10 the SaptadaŚa, for 11-15 the EkavinŚa. The Ayus has for 1 Trivṛt, for 2-5 PañcadaŚa, for 6-10 SaptadaŚa, and 11-15 EkavinŚa. At the Vișuvant the sun is honoured with offerings, but the Mahavrata 1 is much more fully known to us. The rite is according to the ritual allowed to be performed variously as a one-day rite, an Ahina, or in a Sattra, and the latter is its natural place. It is clearly an old festival of the winter solstice, and not even originally, as Hillebrandt holds, of the summer solstice, when the strengthening of the sun was an essential duty. There is beaten an earth drum, doubtless to scare away the demons who might attempt to overthrow the power of the sun; the Hotṛ sits on a swing and is swung to and fro, to represent the path of the sun in the sky, and strengthen its power to perform it; ritual abuse is exchanged for fertility purposes, between a student or, in a later usage, a Magadha, and a hetaira; there is actually carried out sexual intercourse; the consecrated persons are alternately praised and reviled; there is a mimic fight between an Aryan and a Śūdra for the possession of a white round skin which is declared to be a symbol of the sun; 2 the skin of an unfruitful cow is hung up or stretched out and warriors pierce through it with arrows, perhaps as a rain spell. Women celebrate to the sound of the lute 

in the south the patrons of the ceremony: maids dance round the fire with water pitchers, while the Stotra is being performed: they pour the water on the fire, and their song shows that they desire richness in milk with water for the cows. The desire of heat and rain seems clearly united: the position of the sun nearest earth is indicated by the priest, who touches the board of the

swing and the earth with one hand, and says, The God hath united with the goddess '.1 

From the point of view of the priest, most important elements of the Mahāvrata are the Mahāvrata Stotra or the Prstha Stotra, corresponding to the Mahaduktha of the Hotṛ: it is noteworthy for the fact that it is intended to reproduce the form of the fire, the five Samans, the Gayatra, Rathantara, Bṛhat, Bhadra, and Rājana, are equated to the head, right and left wing, tail and body, and accompanied by the Stomas from Trivṛt to PañcavinŚa in order. The later ritual of the Śankhayana Śrauta Sūtra identifies the Stotra with the body of a man, showing the influence of the mystic speculations of the priests who performed the Agnicayana, 'piling of the fire', and who saw in this act the making up of the universal father, the creator god Prajapati, identified with the primeval giant who in the Puruşasūkta is conceived as having, when sacrificed, provided the material for the whole world."

C 

Of other Sattras an interesting one is that performed on the Dṛṣadvati, a specially sacred river, and still more that on the Sarasvati, which is marked by many special rites. The sacrifice is performed as the sacrificer moves along the bank from the place where the Sarasvati disappears in the desert, across the confluence with the Dṛṣadvati, at the crossing of which an offering is made to Apam Napāt, to the place where the stream arises, the Plakṣa Präsravana, where an offering is made to Agni as Kama, desire'. The sacrifice is accompanied by the driving of a hundred young calves along with a bull into the wood, and is terminated when these have reached the number of a thousand, or the sacrificer dies, or the cows disappear. At the end of the whole sacrifice, a mare and a woman are given as a present to the worthiest of those who have taken part in the performance. The final bath is taken at Kāravapacava on the Yamuna. This and the Drṣadvati offering are important for the fact that they mention several places of the Kuru land, such as Parīņah," and indicate the boundaries of that country, the chief home of Brahmanism. 

## 19. The Sautrāmaṇī 

The Sautrāmaņi 6 is not a Soma sacrifice, but is classified by the Sutras as a Haviryajña, though its chief characteristic in its form as recorded is the offering of Sura. It has two distinct forms, the Kaukili, which is an inde- pendent offering, the other the Caraka, an offering which forms part of another 

This is clearly the wedding of sun and earth, a form of that of sky and earth; cf. Brunnhofer, Arische Urzeit, pp. 325- 7; Cook, Zeus, i. 526 ff., 604, 672, 709, 733.

offering, as the Rājasūya and the Agnicayana. It is prescribed for various occasions, but the characteristic ones are the rites for a man who is vomiting Soma, or from whose nose, ears, &c., Soma flows as a result of over-indulgence in the drink. The Caraka form seems clearly a reference to the school of the Black Yajurveda, which is often so named: the view of Hillebrandt 1 that it alludes to the medical teacher Caraka, in whose school Sura was used as medicine, is improbable and unsupported by any evidence. The differences between the two forms are of detail: thus the Kaukili is marked by the singing by the Brahman of certain Samans. The use of the Sura is accom- panied by offerings of animals, to Indra a bull, to Sarasvati a sheep, and to the AŚvins a goat. These are offered on the fourth day of the rite, which is modelled on the fourth-day Soma sacrifice, along with oblations of milk, of Sura, and of animal fat. The goat for Agni and Soma, which in the Soma sacrifice precedes the pressing day, is replaced by a bull for Agni, and the barren cow at the end of the Soma rite is replaced by a bull for Indra Vayodhas. In the Sură, which is prepared from various kinds of herbs in a wonderful way, are mixed hairs 2 of a lion, a tiger, and a wolf, to confer corresponding characteristics on the partakers of the cups of Sura. The Fathers also receive an offering of the Sura. After the libation to Vanaspati in the animal offering, a throne of Muñja grass is set down between the two Vedis, which, as at the Varuṇapraghasas, are used in this rite, and on this the sacrificer sits down with silver under his left and gold under his right foot: the offerings, thirty- two in number, of fat are then made, while the remainder is used to sprinkle the sacrificer, so that it flows from his mouth. The Adhvaryu then touches the sacrificer, who calls on his servants with their ritual names, and they lift him up first knee high, then navel high, and then as high as the mouth. He then steps on to a tiger-skin as establishing himself in the lordship: the thirty- third cup of fat is offered, a Saman is sung, and all join in the finale. A milk offering to Mitra and Varuna, and a bull for Indra Vayodhas conclude the rite. It is conjectured by Hillebrandt that the rite was taken over by the Indians from a non-Brahmanical tribe, and then remodelled on the basis of the Soma ritual he thinks that the Sura was once a drink akin to the Madhu, and offered to the AŚvins. The AŚvins are not prominent as Soma-drinkers, but they certainly are connected with the Madhu, and the Sură seems from the evidence of the Avesta to have been once a sacred and honoured drink. The Madhu or Sură cult, he thinks, may have flourished on the banks of the Saras- vati, where the Vasisthas show little anxiety about the Soma cult, and may not originally have practised it, but have learned it from later intruders. The

hypothesis, however, is not supported by any evidence of value,1 and there are clear traces that the rite was based on myth, that of the effects on Indra of over-indulgence in Soma and the resulting illness which was cured by the efforts of the AŚvins and Sarasvati, a fact alluded to in the Rigveda. 

## 20. The Piling of the Fire 

The piling of the fire altar is a rite which is regarded as being always available for performance along with the Soma sacrifice, but which is declared to be obligatory only in certain cases, including the Mahāvrata, and even that view is far from being universally prescribed. There can be no doubt that it was by no means a normal or frequent rite: its elaboration is such that no ordinary sacrificer would trouble himself with it, and it must have been only occasionally used. The main authority for it in the Śatapatha Brahmaņa is a different authority from the chief source of rules on the rest of the sacri- ficial ritual including the Soma sacrifice, Yajñavalkya: it is attributed to Śandilya, and others mentioned in connexion with it are Tura Kāvaṣeya,3 who performed it on the Karoti, and Nagnajit Gandhāra, names which have been held with some force to point to the North-West, where in conjunction with the fire cult there may have been special activity, perhaps in consequence of contact with Iran. 

The beginning of the sacrifice is the offering of victims, including a man: the heads are to be built into the altar and the bodies are placed in the water whence the clay for the fire-pan and the bricks of the altar are derived. The clay is solemnly collected with the aid of a horse, an ass, and a goat. a procession being formed to the place which the horse is supposed to deter- mine, and the clay being brought formally back. Then the wife of the sacri- ficer makes the Aṣāḍha brick, and the sacrificer makes the fire-pan and the three ViŚvajyotis bricks. The fire-pan is kept filled with fire, from the time of the consecration, which takes place fourteen days after the animal offering. and for a year the sacrificer carries it about, and performs various rites, striding the Viṣņu steps and adoring the fire in the pan. Then comes the actual ceremony of the building of the altar, which is made in five layers, of which the first has 1,950 and the whole together 10,800 bricks, which are given diverse names; the length of time used in the rite differs greatly: the first four layers may occupy eight months and the last four, or a few days may suffice. Noteworthy features of the building are the placing in the lowest layer of a golden figure of a man, which seems to be meant as symbolic

of Agni, who is thus as it were put bodily in the altar, while a tortoise is also immured alive,1 and addressed as a mystic being. After the altar has been erected, there are 425 libations for the Rudras, made of all sorts of wild plants. The mode of cooling the altar is also noteworthy: the Adhvaryu draws lines on the altar with a reed to which a flag, a twig of VetaŚa, and an Avaka plant, all things closely connected with the waters, are tied. The formal placing of fire on the altar is carried out with much ceremony: the priest and the sacrificer step upon the altar: milk of a black cow with a white calf is offered on the last-deposited naturally perforated brick, the fire-brand is deposited on it, and special wood is used to kindle it. Then come a number of libations, for VaiŚvānara, for the forty-nine winds, which are to be as helpful to the sacrificer as they were formerly for Indra, the shower of wealth libations, 372 libations for Agni, thirteen for the names of the months, sixteen again for Agni, the Partha offering, one introduced by the mythical king Pṛthi Vainya 2 at his royal consecration, and fourteen Vājaprasaviyas, whose remnants mixed with milk and water serve to anoint the sacrificer, who, according as he touches the altar or stands or sits, uses a black antelope-skin as a carpet, or a goat-skin, has certain wishes fulfilled. After the anointing, follow six further Partha oblations, twelve Rāṣṭrabhṛts, and three oblations to the winds, which are offered in the place of the horses of the chariot, and treated as if they were horses. The first pressing day of the rite is marked by the yoking of the fire before the Prătaranuvāka, and by its releasing with appropriate formulae at night. To the ordinary rites of the Soma sacrifice are added offerings to the minor deities, Anumati, Kuhū, Rākā, Sinīvālī, and for Dhatṛ at the Udaya- nīyā Iṣṭi, and at the very end of the final libations an offering of milk for Mitra and Varuna. The performer of the piling is subjected to certain taboos: he may not go out in the rain, nor eat the flesh of a bird, the altar being deemed to be of bird or human form, nor have relations with any save a wife of the same caste after a second offering of the Agnicayana, which is permissible if the first has not good results, he may only have relations with his own wife, and after a third not even with her. In these cases the obvious meaning is that the sacrificer is to avoid wasting in any way the sacred power of the fire, which is within him, and which might be dispersed uselessly, while he must not eat the bird which is the symbol of the fire. 

There can be little doubt that this vast ceremonial is not a simple or primitive rite: it is a definite attempt of the priest to embody in the ritual the conception already found in the Rigveda 3 of the creation of the universe from the dismemberment of the primeval giant, which requires as its comple- ment the process of building up the fire altar, which is a symbol of the universe, and of the cosmic sacrifice which is eternally repeated. It falls, therefore, to be considered below as an important expression of the theory of sacrifice of 

This practice may clearly be connected 

with the recorded discovery of toads living inside rocks, &c.

the Brahmans: much as there is of magic and many offerings as there are in the ritual, it is essentially in conception the embodiment of philosophic theory, a fact which explains its loose connexion with any real sacrifices.1 

## 21. The Hotr Formulae 

The ritual requires in many places the use of the Hotṛ formulae, which are formulae in which the priests are mentioned as being identical with deities and other objects, the formulae being distinguished according to the number of priests so mentioned as Caturhotṛ, Pañcahotṛ, and so on. They are termed offerings, because they represent various sacrifices from the Agnihotra to the Soma offering inclusive. They are often used in the course of important rites, in which case they are normally assigned to the sacrificer, but also they can be employed independently, either by themselves or with the accompaniment of cups of some offering and the cry Svaha. Thus a man, who wishes cattle, must for twelve nights drink hot water, put on a fresh garment and sleep on the ground. Early next morning he goes east, says the DaŚahotṛ, and offers the Caturhotṛ with butter. They can even be used as spells, in which case an offering is made on salt ground, or a break in the earth, and in place of the ordinary Vasat-call harsh words like khat or phat are used. This use is clearly an abuse the formulae are of the nature of Upanisads, and must be treated as representing the desire to substitute mental processes for the tedious- ness of the sacrifice. But it was inevitable that even they should sink to magic uses.2 

## 22. The Expiations 

In the intolerable complications of the Vedic sacrifice, coupled with the tendency to inaccuracy of the Indian mind of the Vedic period, may be found ample excuse for the number of prescriptions which are laid down for the purpose of expiating errors in the sacrifice. In some cases the expiations are elaborate in the extreme in most they are fairly simple. Of the former the most notorious case is that of the Kuṣmaṇḍa, which serves as a means of purification from grave sins, and which is dealt with in detail in the Taittiriya Aranyaka, whereas most of the other expiations are confined to the Sutras or to the later portions of the Brahmaņas. 

4 

Of these expiations the most interesting are given in the KauŚika Sutra," which details magic ceremonies intended to remove the evil results of the violation of certain taboos. One of these is the primitive dread of disturbing

the earth, for which a natural explanation can be found in the deadly character of the work of commencing agricultural operations in a tropical climate: the earth must be consoled for the wound on her by the operation of opening her body.1 An expiation is equally required for the eating of food which has been buried in the ground: it takes the homoeopathic form of offering in the fire grains which have been so buried. In domestic life the sin of marrying before an elder brother must be expiated and two hymns are provided for this express purpose. Expiations are also provided against Agni as Kravyād, the term which applies to the fire by which the body of the dead is burned, but which denotes also a definite aspect of Agni which he may assume without the actual contact with the dead. But the list of expiations is endless: there is hardly any sphere in which errors cannot be committed and expiations required, and the Brahman is the author par excellence of these rites.
