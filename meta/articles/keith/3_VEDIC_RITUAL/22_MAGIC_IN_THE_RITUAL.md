## 1. The Relations of Magic to Religion 

THE theory that all religion is later than magic has already been discussed, and its fundamental weakness pointed out,1 and it is therefore possible to con- sider the question of the relation of these two factors apart from any pre- conceived doctrine of the priority of magic. The position in the literature of Vedic India is a simple one with very few exceptions the Rigveda is a book in which magic is not dealt with a few late hymns are indeed found there, but these stand out as exceptions in a religious milieu. (The Atharvaveda is a book of magic, mingled with some theosophy: that it is priestly magic, and not popular magic uninfluenced by the priests is clear: the priests have con- stantly altered, and changed much of what they dealt with, but the book itself is conclusive proof that the priests of that time were keenly concerned with magic rites. The position is further made clear by the Brahmaņas, which show beyond possibility of doubt that the whole of the sacrifice was penetrated by conceptions of magic. Scarcely any rite but can be so adapted as to pro- duce magic ends the rites are often varied in detail for this very purpose, the mode in which the post is covered with the cord will determine the amount of rain which will fall, the priest can bring to nothing the kingdom if he varies by manipulations the offering; he is constantly told how to alter the words, when he dislikes the sacrificer, or when he seeks to obtain for him such special blessings as a male child. } 

2 

The Atharvaveda and the Brāhmaṇas prove, therefore, that the India of their period was one in which magic and religion were inextricably blended: the same conclusion is suggested by the Rigveda itself: the man who is pure complains that he is called a magician and a companion of evil spirits, and doubtless many among the priests who composed the songs of the Rigveda were not devoted to magic or specially interested in it. The exaltation which saw in the poetry of the Rigveda the highest form of honour which the gods could receive, would scarcely trouble itself about the lower field of magic. But we cannot believe that there was ever a time when the Vedic sacrifice was not filled with magic elements, and all that we can say with certainty is

Magic and sacrifice represent two different aspects of man's efforts to accomplish his desires. They are essentially distinct and are felt to be so in the higher faiths. But in primitive religions 

the elements lie side by side in no strongly felt differentiation.

that the desire to see magic in everything was one which was growing in the period of the Brahmanas, which degrade the sacrifice from the position of an appeal to the bounty of heaven to the position of the greatest power on earth, which controls the gods and produces whatever is desired by the priests. Magic thus won a powerful support from theosophy, and we cannot in the Vedic literature say that magic was regarded as a wicked thing, except when it was practised by others against a man. If he could, he would himself use magic to confound his enemies.1 The code of Manu in effect well sums up the point of view of its own, and also of the earlier Vedic period, in the doctrine that, while witchcraft is a bad thing, the Brahman who is wronged need not seek redress tamely by civil process through the intervention of the royal authority, but should assert his own power by his magic arts. The position is natural enough; all religions have to contend with magic, and, while the higher religions cast much aside, they cannot be successful in removing all. The Vedic religion had, however, developed no such moral or religious basis as would render it possible to demand the disappearance of magic rites, and thus magic flourished under its aegis in almost a disconcerting degree. Nothing shows how much the idea of the magic power of the sacrifice and its importance superseded moral considerations in the minds of the priests than the offerings prescribed by one text to enable a man to break faith at pleasure without punishment by Varuna. 

## 2. The Nature of Vedic Magic 

In the sphere of Vedic magic we have to do both with personal and with impersonal substances. The conception of all sorts of demons as threatening man is one which is supplemented by the more impersonal view of substances or potencies, which dwell in things, and which are often, therefore, of value in magic rites. It is possible that the earlier view is that which conceives these potencies either animatistically as actually alive, or animistically as spirits, but in the Vedic literature the two views, personal and impersonal, are both clearly found, and, like everything in the Veda, they are never clearly kept apart. Such powers are the power of error in the sacrifice which clings to the sacrificial post, and therefore may pass to the sacrificers, if care is not taken to render it harmless, the nature in woman, which causes her to slay her husband or to bear no children to him, and to bring death and disease among his cattle."

It is not vitally to be distinguished from the strength of the tiger, which is found in its hair and its skin, and which makes these things suited for use in many magic performances, by which man seeks to attain for himself strength and kingship over men, such as the tiger exercises over animals. The frog and the Avakā plants can be used for cooling, for they have in them the nature of the water, a fact which shows clearly how real the presence of the deity in a symbol was to the Vedic conception. The banished king uses a clod of earth from his home in his desire to regain his kingdom: the lightning 1 leaves its strength in the tree which it blasts, the boar in the earth which it kicks up: 2 the name, the image, the hair, the very footprints of man, are so connected with him as to be suitable modes of injury. Hence we can understand such legends as the theory that in laughing Makha allowed his brilliance to depart from him, that the gods placed it in the plants, and thus was millet produced. Or again the white Valakhilyas practised asceticism: half of it with the resulting power Tarkṣya drank, and thus created the bird Garuda. The same idea displays itself in the constant fear of being affected by the mouth, which is one of the motives, no doubt, of the fasting recommended often by the Veda; of being affected by mere inhalation, whence often the holding of the breath is laid down; or of being affected by sight, whence often the eyes must be shut, or the sacrificer must at least not look round. The constant play of fancy between the real substance and the spirit is seen in the treatment of such ideas as Papman, impersonal evil, or the spirit of a thousand eyes, or of Takman, the actual fever disease, which seizes the patient, and makes him shiver, and the spirit which brings this about.

Of the means, which we may describe as magic in opposition to the rule of petition and offering which is religion, much of course is based on actual observation of fact, and much is based on mistaken fancies: magic, indeed, is doubtless in some sense and in fact the forerunner of science, and like science is slow in clearing away misconceptions of all kinds. At times it is desirable to attract substances or spirits, at times urgently necessary to drive away such things another branch of the subject is divination, which rests on the same foundation of contiguity or similarity, upon which rest the other laws of magic. Che means are various: the word is of great importance, and so again are figures or representations of things which may be used as substitutes for or in addition to articles connected with the things or persons, who form the sub- jects of the conjuration. The time again is of importance: many things should be done at night, but others at special times of the day or the year, and

various places are specially favourable, such as cross-roads, or graveyards, where spirits do mostly congregate, and where are the evil birds of prey and the jackals. But in special circumstances almost any place is suited specially for the rite. 

It is natural, that, representing as it does a part of the primitive science of man, magic should be found in similar forms all the world over. There is little that is of special character in Indian magic, and the variety of its rites is enormous fortunately or unfortunately for our opinion of the intelligence of the Vedic Indian not only has the Atharvaveda come down to us, but the KauŚika Sūtra contains (vii-lii) in the fullest detail, often however unintelli- gible to us, the nature of the rites which were used with the texts of that Veda. Other details occur in the PariŚiṣṭas of the Atharvaveda, in the Samavidhāna Brāhmaṇa, in the Ṛgvidhana and minor texts. The antiquity of these works is by no means very great: the age of most of the practices may be indefinitely remote. The only practices of which we can say definitely that they are in- novations are those, not at all few in number, in which priestly ingenuity has used mythical ideas, in order to found on them a magic practice. Thus in one rite laid down in the KauŚika Sūtra 1 we find that as a means of driving away evil spirits the use of a food is prescribed, which has been cooked with wood of a tree in which birds nest: this is due merely to the fact that in accompanying verses Indra, the averter of evil spirits, is invited to come as a bird to a tree. 

## 3. The Removal of Hostile Influences 

In a modified degree the principle is adopted in Vedic ritual that hostile powers should be propitiated. Thus the Rakṣases are given the portions that fall away from the grain, when it is pounded for the offerings: the blood, the entrails, the excrement of the animal victim, are made over to them or the snakes. Diseases treated as demons are propitiated and shown reverence in the hope, which is expressed, that they will depart, being satisfied with what is done for them. The disease Takman is entreated to depart, and addressed as a god, just as among the Esths down to modern times the same procedure of paying homage was adopted to make a disease depart. What is more interesting is that both methods might be tried in close conjunction: the jackal might be addressed with formulae of reverence at the one time, and at the same time a fire brand be thrown at it.3 The ants receive an offering, but, if that fails, a poisonous mixture is made for them, and the aid of the gods in their utter extirpation is invoked. Snakes are simultaneously treated with reverence, and their extinction invoked: in the snake offering itself, while the snakes are fed, the sacrificer draws round the house a line of water to keep them away from it. But as a rule the attitude of the Vedic Indian to

the hostile powers is the desire to banish them far from his life, to deceive and cheat them in every way: hence such actions as fasting to forbid them en- trance, refraining from breathing, from intercourse, from looking round and so on. The same idea is also to be seen in the fact that on certain occasions dis- guises are adopted, and that the hair which is cut from the child or youth is carefully buried. In this last instance, however, in many cases the hair is prescribed to be buried in such a place as a cow stall, and in that instance it may be that the burying was rather to bring prosperity to the cows 1 than as a piece of prophylactic magic, or the two ideas may have been merged into one. The difficulties of realizing the precise sense of magic rites is far greater than that of interpreting religious ceremonies. Other modes of avoidance are mentioned, in addition to not looking round at any dread sight, or not coming into physical contact with what is dangerous: thus the mother is impure for ten or twelve days after birth and is avoided, and the bricks for Nirṛti at the setting up of the fire altar are put in place without actual contact. Steps are taken to efface the footsteps of the priest, who carries the fire of the sacrifice, just as a clog is bound to the foot of the dead to wipe out the tracks. Similarly the use of different doors from the normal may be prescribed: the child attacked by the doggie demon cough is taken into the assembly hall, where the spell to exercise the demon is to be performed, through a hole made in the thatch. When the sacrificer dies, and the fire hitherto maintained by him becomes the place of resort of powers of death, it is removed, but not by the door. Or, again, something may be interposed to shut out the demons: water they cannot cross, and the use of water prevents the evil influence of the bricks for Nirrti or the funeral rite exercising its power. Similar cases of the inter- position of obstacles are presented by the use of a stone to sever the living from the dead, the mat 5 employed for the same purpose, and at the sacrifice the enclosing sticks placed round the fire in order to keep off the demons. 

The use of water for actual washing away different forms of evil is extremely common, as in the final bath: the place where a pigeon has alighted is washed clean: the bride is washed to rid her of all evil influences : after dealings with Rudra, demons, or the Fathers, it is necessary to purify oneself by touching water, but not rain water, which is deemed to have some degree of impurity and to spoil offerings on which it falls. The face is wiped after an evil dream. Lead and wool are used also for cleansing purposes.7 The urine of a cow has as in Iran and in modern India great properties of cleansing. The new-born child is washed, and also the breast of the mother: but smoke is also used to purify the child, while fire is a constant source of protection. The sickle with which is cut the grass for the sacrifice is made glowing by means of fire, thus driving off the Rakṣases.

Vedic Ritual 

[Part III 

The use of noise to drive away demons is common: the drums at the Mahāvrata rite are paralleled by the sounds made by the Soma stones at the pressing, which are made doubly resonant by the device of putting under them sounding holes. The noise of the Saman is also powerful to drive away evil, if the critics of the Saman singers also make it a ground for the breaking off of the holy study for the day on which it is heard. Pots are beaten at burial. When a gong is beaten, it is expected that the demon which has a child in its grip will be driven away.1 The fragrant bdellion also serves to drive away demons, while the Apāmārga plant is famed for this service, which, as its name denotes, it derives from its power to wipe off the influences of such powers. The ritual use of beating is not unknown: it occurs during the royal consecration, when the priests gently beat the prince, and it may per- haps be recognized in the beating of their thighs by the maidens who dance round the fire at the Mahāvrata, bearing on their heads the water pitchers." 

2 

The use of a staff is of special interest: the student is given a staff, and is forbidden ever to let anything intervene between his body and it. When his studentship is over, it is thrown in the water with the rest of his outfit, but he obtains a new staff, and this is expressly stated to be of use not merely for protection against human foes but also from Rakṣases and PiŚãcas. The Soma offerer has a staff, which he receives from the priest to guard him, and which he ought never to let go.5 The Maitrăvaruņa priest stands through the service with staff in hand, slightly bending forward, in the attitude of readiness to smite the demons." A specially consecrated staff brings fortune wherever one goes: if a circle is drawn with it and one thinks of a place, then no enemy can enter that place. The wooden sword of the sacrificer is used to cut up the earth on the altar place, and it is thrown into the dust heap, being treated as the enemy, Araru, who is destroyed. After an offering to the Fathers the sword is drawn over the altar to send away the demons. Small staves are shot in the air at the wedding ceremony to destroy the sight of the Rakṣases. 

Yet another form is that of shaking: the black antelope skin used at a sacrifice is shaken out with the view of removing any evil that may have crept there the corner of the garment of him who offers to the Fathers is similarly shaken to remove any evil spirit. Remains of Sura were thrown away on an ant heap. Akin to these rites is the use of a comb to purify the hair of the bride from dangerous influences of any sort, and also the passing of people through narrow holes, of which the classical example is that of Apālā in the Rigveda, whom Indra dragged through the hole of the chariot, of the cart,

and of the yoke, and so healed of a skin disease, and which is to be seen also in the marriage ritual, when the hole of the yoke of a car is placed on the bride. The aim of this rite is probably also to be seen in the making of a hole in the roof of the assembly hall for the introduction of the boy who is ill: the narrowness was probably a feature of the rite. The question which arises in this case, as in the case of the passing of an army under the yoke in the Roman usage, is whether the guilt of blood or the disease is considered to be wiped away by the contact with the sides of the hole, or whether it is to be classed as one of the devices by which an enemy is deceived and the angry demons or spirits of the dead are baulked of their prey. 

3 

In many other cases the plan is adopted of the transfer of the evil to some other person or thing. The principle is at work in the case of the scapegoat, of which the classic example is to be found at the final bath of the horse sacrifice. The bride's garment after marriage is hung up on a tree or post, so that the evil influence in it may be disposed of. Similarly the cloth with which she is wiped is given to the guardian of the maiden, who puts it in a cow- stall or hangs it up in the wood. The Vratyas at the end of the festival, by which they are admitted to the Brahmanical community, hand their apparel and utensils to other Vratyas, or an inferior Brahman of Magadha, who bears away the defects inherent in them. A cow which is unfit for a fee is given to an enemy. After a miscarriage the woman is taken to three different huts: she is made to stand on lead and washed, her dark garment is taken off, and the hut burned. The sufferer from a headache goes out with a turban on and scatters grains: when an attack comes on, he deposits the turban, the winnowing fan which he has used, and a bowstring: apparently the demon is to come out of the head into the turban and to make for the grains, when he will be attacked by the bow.5 To avert a bad omen a hook is tied to the foot of a black bird, a cake attached, and it is sent away to hang on to the enemy as the hook hangs to it. Sleeplessness is banished to Trita Aptya or to an enemy. An offering is prescribed, by which it is possible to prevent two enemies transferring to a third person their mutual hatred. For a person who is possessed of an evil spirit various devices are combined: fragrant substances are mixed together and burned, the person concerned stands against the water of a stream, and water is poured over him, an offering is hung up on a bird- frequented tree, in each case to take away the evil. Fever is banished to the distant people of Gandhara and the Mujavants. A ceremony is prescribed by which when a man is thirsty in illness he transfers the thirst to another man.? The disease jaundice is transferred to birds of appropriate hue, like the

thrush or parrot. Fever is transferred to a frog by pouring water over the patient and putting a frog under the bed; the connexion of the frog with the disease may be very old. An interesting means of finding out the presence in a house of a demon like a PiŚãca is to hang up in the house kindling wood, and the strew for the sacrifice: if they are moved, the presence of the spirit is certain.2 

Diseases are specially often the subjects of exorcism in one form or another a woman suffering from lung disease must be rubbed by a chaste man with balls of fresh lotus leaves, limb by limb, and thereafter the leaves are thrown to the west.3 

3 He who suffers from an inherited disease is deluged with water and a plough is held, apparently a mixture of washing and contact. Diarrhoea is dealt with by tying a string round a bunch of Muñja grass, and giving the patient to eat earth from a field and from an ant-heap. Sick cows are made to drink salt water.6

## 4. The Attraction of Beneficial Substances and Powers 

The sacrificer must avail himself of the same means to attack his enemies as they use to attack him: if the enemy assail, the skilled priest can send against them the demon Apvā which seems to be the diarrhoea caused by terror, and to symbolize in emphatic fashion the fear produced by panic in battle: this performance is already recorded in the Rigveda.' So also it is perfectly in keeping with the ideas of magic that terror and fear would be conveyed to the enemy by the process of sending a white-footed one, presum- ably a sheep, against the opposing host. In such a case Apvā is indeed a dreadful thing, but it is in the control of the priest and therefore useful to him. In other cases he has more direct control: he can use one substance for wash- ing himself, another he can drink or cat, another use as an amulet; with yet another he can rub or anoint himself. The avoidance of the touch of anything dangerous is one side of a practice, of which the other is the touching of things which are bencficial. The touching of the victim has two sides : it may convey the death to which the victim is being led, but it may also convey and this is the view which Brahman logic 1o finally adopts-the power and strength of the divine essence. Hence we have an enormous number of rites, the standing on a tiger-skin to obtain royal power, the use of an antelope-skin, the placing of the wife on a bull's hide, the placing of her and of the student upon a stone to attain firmness, the depositing at the fire-piling and other offerings on the place of the fire altar of a piece of earth

from an ant-heap, since the ants as finders of waters give richness: the same ants per contra are often used to destroy dangerous substances like the remnants of offerings.

Various strange messes are prescribed for eating: the least unpleasant may be the mixture of milk, of cow-dung, of bdellion, and salt which is taken at an agricultural offering: the burying of a similar mess could, however, produce equal results. The wife must eat a barley-corn with two beans attached to secure a male and a strong infant. A peculiarly unpleasant drink, in which the members of a cow form an element, will secure all desires. The common eating of the king and the priest 3 and of the bride and bridegroom show that unity of essence was thus produced: it may be conjectured that the Tānu- naptra ceremony was originally of this kind, though the common eating has disappeared. The idea would then be that he who injured any of those united to him by the common meal would injure himself. The use of anointing is often recorded an enemy might be injured by anointing sweat on reed arrow-points and offering them.5 The king and the sacrificer at the royal consecration and the Sautrāmaņi were formally anointed and so on. Other means are breathing, as upon the new-born child to give it life, and the putting of substances in the nose to produce offspring. 

8 

The eyes should not see many things, such as the taboos imposed on the Snātaka and his teacher, but, on the other hand, the eye may have purifying influence, and hence with the eye of Mitra the guest may look on what is given to him.' But the glance of a snake is deadly, and so may the glance of the bride be therefore her husband places salve on her eyes to secure his safety." 

8 

In a number of interesting cases effective results are produced by using in the rite things connected with the object to be attained. Thus for a prince in exile it is well in the rite to use, for the kindling wood to cook a magic drink, wood from a stump of a tree which has grown again, or to place on the fire altar earth from his old realm. To defeat the ants when troublesome the use of a ladle of Badhaka wood is valuable, as Bādhaka means 'repelling'. If victory in battle is the object, earth which a boar has torn up may be placed on the altar, and thus give the rite the strength of the boar. 

In other cases burying things produces good results, as in the burying above referred to of a curious mixture for the prosperity of the herds: so too the burying of hair and other objects such as nails. On the other hand, it is necessary to provide rites to dig up objects, such as one's own hair and nails, which an enemy has buried: a special ceremony for this is mentioned in the Taittiriya Samhita.10

Vedic Ritual 

[Part III 

For the purpose of protection the use of amulets is very common indeed : it is not indeed quite clear exactly what idea was conceived to be embodied in the use of these amulets. In the opinion of Oldenberg,' the view taken of the amulet was, in the first instance, that there was in it a spirit which took its abode therein, but in the period of the Vedic belief the view had been altered by a process of development, so that the effect of the amulet is produced by a substance resident therein. It is, however, a little difficult to accept this view of the development of ideas. The view that the first element is spirit, and that the belief in the utility of the amulet is due to the view that a spirit is living in it, is unnecessarily refined: the fact, admitted by Oldenberg, that the amulet is not rarely addressed and treated as having an actual spirit in it, is most naturally of all explained by the fact of animatism: the amulet is conceived to be a living substance: only by a natural development of thought is there any element of a non-spiritual substance found. Animism in the strict sense of the word, therefore, need hardly come into operation, in so far as it postulates the belief in a mere detachable spirit. 

The potency of nakedness as a magic rite is seldom mentioned save for rain spells the KauŚika, however, tells how to expiate a day of ill omen by sitting naked and rubbing the forehead, and in its collection of spells for inducing slumber in women it prescribes nakedness in the performer of a rite, consisting in the besprinkling of the place where she is from a vessel full of water and the remains of an offering. 

## 5. Mimetic Magic 

In one special class of cases the effect which it is desired by magic means to produce in nature is brought about by the simple plan of representing in sensible form, within the means available to man, the operations which it is desired should take place. Thus when an enemy is to be defeated it is useful to break in two a piece of grass which is thrown towards the opposing host the breaking of the grass symbolizes the breaking in two of the armed foemen. Or the rite can be made more effective in quite a simple way: as a daughter-in-law by an old taboo is expected to shrink away from her father-in-law, so by taking the hostile enemy as the daughter-in-law, and by

addressing to it the remark that the father-in-law is looking at it, the hostile army will then break up in utter confusion.1 More elaborate instances of the same thing are of course the ceremonies of the Mahavrata where the water thrown on the fire produces rain, and the winning of the white round skin which represents the sun is a spell representing the recovery of the sun from the hostile powers affecting it. In the royal consecration the victory of the king over his rival is graphically depicted in mimic form: his success in dicing is a picture of his success in the position of king on earth. The fertility of the earth and of the crops is produced by the mimicry of sexual relationships at the Soma sacrifice, at the horse sacrifice, and by the actual performance of ritual intercourse at the Mahāvrata offering. At the Vājapeya the chariot race is a magic performance to secure the pre-eminence of the sacrificer, just as in the rite he is made to be the victor in the race in question." The Sautrāmaņi offering is a clear imitation of the story of the healing of Indra from his intoxication with Soma after the slaying of the demon Namuci: it is used to secure the sacrificer the success for which he is anxious in whatever sphere of life he may live. This sort of magic is particularly common in rain magic: 5 herbs are often dipped in water, black garments assumed, black victims offered. One rite is of interest: the heads of a dog and a ram, hairs, and old shoes are fastened to the end of a bamboo, and passes are made in the air as if in combat with a demon: the animals may be intended to aid in the breaking open of the sky, just as at the Mahavrata the shooting of arrows through, but not so as to penetrate, a skin, is pre- sumably intended to let the waters of the skies flow down on the earth.

The death of a man can be, as in all lands, compassed thus in many ways: an image of him may be made of wax and melted or it may be pierced to the heart, or again his shadow, which is in some degree the man, may be likewise treated again a chameleon may be killed and formally burned in mimicry of the rite of the burning of the dead man. The footmark of a maiden can be used as a means of winning her love: the footmark of a beleaguered king is scattered to the winds. Worms are generally to be banished by the crushing and the burning of twenty-one selected UŚira worms. The running away of a slave or some other persons may be prevented by the idiotic rite of pouring round the person affected the urine of the performer from the horn of a living animal, a symbol of strength: the urine represents the person to whom the slave belongs, and thus the person in living presence is in the vicinity and prevents the slave from running away.10 The destruction of misfortune of any kind often takes the shape of the burning or throwing away in water of old

things such as garments, sunshades or shoes.1 To destroy the borer insect which is damaging crops, one of the species is buried, head downwards, the mouth closed with thread, to prevent further depredations. When the Soma is being pressed, he who desires to destroy a foe should think of him as he pounds with the pressing stone: the pounding will directly affect the foe. More amusing is the device to be adopted to secure the transfer of a stream from one course to another: the new bed desired is watered, plants like the Avaka are put along it, and a frog is also put there. The stream will therefore follow the path thus laid down. The same principle is at work in the rule by which objects to be attained arc often expressed in a speech as so won. Thus when the wife is given an offering to look at in the ceremony of the parting of the hair and is asked, 'What dost thou say?' she replies, 'Offspring.' Similarly in the rite to attain male offspring her answer as to what she drinks, in the magic drink given to her, is the producing of a son. The husband and wife on the fifth day after the wedding ask a young Brahman what he sees, to which he replies, Sons and cattle.' So in the rite of the animal offering the question, Is it ready?' has always the answer that it is; in the plough festival the question of the wife whether the ploughing has been accomplished receives an affirmative reply; and such cases are to be found in every important rite. A mode of divination can be made a mode of conveying good fortune in this way: thus a merchant, going on a journey, places balls of dung on the limbs of a friendly Brahman and asks what sort of day it is, to which the latter replies that it is good and lucky."

## 6. Divination and Ordeal 

The principle of divination is in large measure directly due to the doctrine of mimetic magic: if the use of a representation of things can produce them, it is also legitimate, if less easy, to deduce the future of events from the behaviour of things, which are supposed to be an imitation of the events. This, however, is no doubt not the whole ground of the belief in the power to read the future, and, moreover, the fact that the future was uncertain must have induced many people to resort to the gods for aid in unravelling it. In these cases the performances are indeed much the same as in an ordinary species of divination, but the belief is different: it is the view that the future is revealed by the god, through the means employed: magic here is supple- mented as often by religious conceptions.

The use of means is very varied: the fire of the sacrifice and the victim at the sacrifice are specially suited to give knowledge by their magic connexion with the gods as well as religious conceptions: more clearly connected with the activity of divine powers in Vedic belief is the drawing of omens from the flight and the movements of animals, which are specially clearly connected with birds or beasts, with gods or spirits of the dead or demons. When a ceremony is performed to win for a maiden a husband, the side from which crows first appear is that from which her wooer will come.1 The movement of the cow at a particular moment in the Soma sacrifice shows the fortune of the sacrificer. The clear flaming of the fire at a sacrifice brings with it the prospect of twelve villages for the sacrificer; if it smokes, of at least three.3 More interesting is the rule that, when the body of the dead is being burned, the soul will go to the heaven, atmosphere, or the earth according as the eastern, western, or southern fire first reaches it. The owl is invoked to fly round the village and give signs for the future: it is a bird which flies to the dwellings of the gods, and the Rigveda already knows birds of omen." The hyena's howl is uttered either of its own will, or on the prompting of other powers. The battle's result can be judged by the lighting of a special fire on a suitable place and observing the movements of the fire, or it can be fore- casted by taking three bowstrings, and placing them on a fire: the move- ments of the three, of which the middle one is treated as death, will show the event that which keeps clear from it will represent the victorious army, that which comes into contact with it the army which is to be ruined." The character of the bride can be judged by the choice by her of balls of earth chosen from very various places: the sex of the future child by the fact whether the member of the body of the prospective mother which a Brahman boy touches has a masculine or feminine name.9 

The meanings of dreams is an interesting part of Vedic magic and is dealt with in various passages, including an Atharvan PariŚista. The Rigveda 10 already regards as ominous the making of a garland or neckband in a dream. Ten dreams which forebode death are recorded in the Aitareya Aranyaka : 11 when one sees in a dream a black man with black teeth who kills him, when a boar kills him, when a wild cat springs on him, when one eats and then spits out gold, when one eats honey and lotus roots, when one goes to a village with asses or boars, or when one drives south a black cow with a black calf, wearing

a garland of nard. If one has a dream, one should, as we have seen, wash one's mouth. The view is also held that certain stars are unlucky, especially Mūla.1 Moreover, many sights forebode evil: the sun seeming as the moon, the heaven red like madder, when one's shadow appears upside down in a mirror or water, or when one's head smells like a crow's nest.2 Evil is further portended by meteors and lightning. Of ominous birds the main classes are those which are black or whose appearance or utterance is horrible: the pigeon, the owl, the vulture, the Dirghamukhi, &c., but the bird is also called generally the mouth of Dissolution. Birds, too, are said to go about in the semblance of the Fathers, other animals are seldom mentioned in this regard; the fact that a horse on several occasions is used to forecast prosperity, or other results, is rather due to its connexion with the offering than to its intrinsic nature as ominous, though fortune in popular superstition can be inferred from the neighing of a horse. Other prodigies are the appearance of an ant-heap in the house, the making of honey there by the bees, the scream of a jackal, the drinking of one cow from another, the cows giving blood for milk, and so on.5 

The existence of men skilled in the interpretation of omens is natural and is also recorded, as for instance in the case of the men who could tell the marks which led to luck or otherwise in the choice of a wife. We hear also of a prophet who made his prophecies on the basis of the smoke of dung, the Śakadhūma of the Atharvaveda, whose business it was, it is clear, to fore- cast the weather. We learn also of men who by the means of plants such as the Sadampuṣpă 7 were able to behold sorcerers male and female, whether they went in the sky or on the earth: the same idea of the power of socerers to assume various forms is found in the Rigveda where it asks for the destruction of the demons, who in form of birds fly about the village at night. Necromancy, however, is not apparently known, nor the inspection, on a system, of the entrails of the victims, in order to read the future.

The ordeal is nothing more than a form of divination in one of its aspects: the idea in it is not that the deity would actually punish an accused person so much as that it should by its treatment of him show whether or not he is innocent of the charge made against him. But the analogy of the ordeal to the oath in which the swearer invokes a penalty on himself, if he is telling untruth, shows that the separation of the ideas of punishment and discrimina- tion cannot be assumed to have been present to the Vedic mind: 10 the form

of ordeals recorded for early Vedic times shows the prevalence of punishment at the same time as the test of fact: the Rigveda has not any certain example of the ordeal: the only Brahmaņa cases are those in which Vatsa asserts his purity of Brahmanical origin by walking through the fire without harm affecting him,1 TriŚoka's assertion of superior Vedic knowledge by a fire ordeal and the successful crossing of a stream, and the glowing axe which is brought up for the purpose of testing the accused thief. The fire as a sentient power by failing to burn or by burning shows innocence or guilt: but it punishes at the same time, and this is roughly speaking true of some of even the later ordeals, such as the poison and water ordeals.3 A procedure to prevent the burning of the hand in the ordeal of plunging the hand into boiling oil to extract a piece of gold is prescribed in the KauŚika.* 

## 7. The Magic Spell 

The power of the word is very marked in all systems of magic and naturally not least in India. The magic spell is sometimes in prose, in the style of the formulae used by the Adhvaryus at the sacrifice, more often in verse, some- times newly made for the purpose, sometimes, and indeed very often, chosen without any appropriateness from the vast body of existing sacred literature. Of this latter tendency two examples may be given the number available is legion. The finest hymn to Varuna in the Vedic literature is found in the Atharvaveda where it has been preserved in a charm.5 The great hymn of the Rigveda, which celebrates the god Prajapati in the form of questions, has the second verse used in a spell for preventing the miscarriage of a cow, doubtless for no better reason than that the idiotic system on which names of authors were assigned to every hymn of the collection resulted in postulat- ing an author Hiranyagarbha, he of the golden womb', really an epithet of the supreme god, and the fact that the deity was Prajapati." 

Of the spell one characteristic is the regularity with which many gods are invoked it is absurd to suppose that in these enumerations there was normally any sense of the different deities invoked all that was desired was 

to strengthen the spell by the utterance of as many names of deities as possible in some cases the mention of individuals is dropped and merely the numbers are given, 99 or 88 or 77 and so on: the fondness for such numbers

[Part III 

is a feature of many forms of magic.1 Analogous to this feature is the fact that when anything is to be dealt with every conceivable place where it may be is enumerated: a disease is banished, not merely from the place where it is paining the person afflicted, but from all his members. On the other hand, where possible the exact name and origin of the thing dealt with must be given if one can name father and mother so much the better: the drum 2 is described as coming from the lord of the forest and strung by the cows. Some- times names of, to us, inexplicable and perhaps esoteric character are given, such as hrudu applied in the Atharvaveda to fever, in accordance with the well-known rule that in magic a mysterious name is the most potent of all.4 

8 

A second characteristic of the spells is the stress laid on the recital of comparisons which have magic effect in producing the results desired. The kidneys are made to settle themselves firmly by comparison with the mountains which abide for ever, or the bird which is at rest in its nest, or the cows which have come back to the stall.5 The amulet is made effective by the fact that it was the one bound by the Dākṣāyaṇas on Śatānika. The dying round the Brahman, which is prescribed in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa as the spell par excellence of the Purohita against the foes of his master, is accompanied by comparison with the mode in which the constellations appear and set again. The birth of the embryo is encouraged by the comparison with the wind which moves the lotus pond on all sides, and so on indefinitely. The use of the word 'grow' is necessary when the Arundhati plant is addressed in order to heal a broken bone below', 'away', are used when a disease is expelled: if one practises witchcraft, one should use the word 'broken' when offering a cup in bringing about harmony the word in unison' is of value. The importance of the name has already been mentioned: it results in the giving to each child of a secret name. Nor is there missing the rite by which a formula is repeated backwards: if the offering priest is interrupted by the servants of the sacrificer, he should repeat backwards the DaŚahotṛ formula, and thus bring the sacrifice to ruin." The use of harsh words like phat, &c., is mentioned possibly even as early as the Rigveda.10 

The word has special force in the form of the curse, which is often recorded in Vedic literature and which as is well known is one of the most common motives in later Indian literature. Fish are killed out of hand by men, because they betrayed to the gods Agni when he fled for shelter to the waters and for that deed Agni cursed them to be slain by men.11 The trees which

caused illness to the gods were cursed by the gods to be destroyed by a handle of the woodman's axe, made from their own bodies. The curse is often men- tioned as being invoked to recoil on the curser himself, showing that it was a common form of magic attack. It might also be heightened in effect by a formal offering, in which the rules of the sacrifice are violated and the points of reeds are sacrificed to the accompaniment of formulae declaring that the sacrificer takes from the enemy, who has played him false with his wife, hope and sight, children and cattle, breathing in and breathing out. The curse 

2 in the Brahmanas is constantly expressed in a curious form if a man per- forms an act in the offering incorrectly, then he places himself in such a posi- tion that, if any one were to say of or to him something unpleasant, that would come true. The point is clear: the mistake exposes the man guilty of it to the risk of the effective working of any curse which is invoked upon him.

3 

The Vedic oath is often recorded: the king at the great consecration recorded by the Aitareya Brahmana must swear to his priest to be true, at the cost otherwise of all his merit in sacrifice and gifts to the priests since the beginning of his life, his good deeds, his offspring, passing from him on the occasion of his falsehood. But a still older form of oath recorded 5 is by cows, or waters, or Varuna, and the Indian to this day swears in some cases by Ganges water which he holds in his hand. The legal literature allows oaths for a Brahman by his truth, for a Kṣatriya by his teams and weapons, and for a VaiŚya by his cows, grain and gold, but these are not recorded for the Vedic period, and the first is modern in appearance as compared with the Vedic oaths. Later, too, we find that the touching of oneself in the oath was not rare, as showing the spirits the person to be punished if the oath were not kept : this usage is proved for late Vedic times by the provision that the touch in such a case is, like the offering to Rudra, a ground for purification by means of water.8 Possibly, too, the curses recorded that a man's head shall fly off, which is paralleled by the Buddhist malediction that the head should split in seven pieces, may be connected with this idea of touching the head. A joint curse is that of the Tānūnaptra rite, which is an oath of fidelity of the priest and the sacrificer in the Soma sacrifice, with a curse on the violator of the oath. There is in the Aitareya Brahmana 10 an echo of the famous story of the lotus theft, in which the various persons accused of stealing the lotus fibres declared themselves guiltless by the device of invoking the most dreadful

misfortunes on the head of the thief, while the true thief, the god himself, revealed his nature by invoking nothing but good. (The classical instance of a broken oath is that of Soma, who is punished for falling to keep his promise to dwell with the twenty-seven wives whom he received from Prajapati, by the disease Rajayakṣma, perhaps consumption.1 

## 8. The Magic Sacrifice 

In many cases the sacrifice itself is degraded to merc magic: this is a precise parallel to the degradation of the formulae to spells which we have already seen, and of which the mystic Hotṛ formulae, originally of a superior type of thought, but later degraded to common magic purposes, are the best example. The actual sacrifice itself may be adapted to magical ends: thus to secure the opposite of the natural results the sorcerer performs it with the arrangement reversed as far as may be the movements are not from south to north and from left to right, but from north to south, the region of the dead, and from right to left. Or again the offering verse in a sacrifice for Indra may be addressed to the Maruts, and vice versa in an offering to the Maruts. The KauŚika Sūtra has full descriptions of black magic, an idea which has never been without votaries and which in the Middle Ages attained great fame.2 More directly the sacrifice becomes not merely in the theosophy of the Brah- mans the great power of the universe: more prosaically it becomes the means by which the sorcerers who practise magic against one can be made to show themselves, by which rival wives can be overcome, by which the monarch in exile can regain his throne. The sacrifice can be adapted to these ends by any manipulations of its component parts or by the precise mode in which the ritual acts are performed. 

3 

Slightly different is another method of producing magic results: in this case the nature of the offering chosen differs essentially from the ordinary sacrifice thus ants are offered poison; for a rival reed-points are sacrificed, the order of sacrifice being also altered; 5 to win cattle, dung of a pair of calves, to win sheep, of a pair of sheep, is offered: long life is aimed at by offering nails of Khadira wood; and from the practice of passing people 

1 TS. ii. 3. 5. 1 ff. Two theories of the effect of a meal combined with an oath may be noted. Oldenberg (Rel. des Veda', p. 502, n. 4) thinks that the comunon meal results in creating identity of substance of the partakers, so that he who wrongs another thus wrongs himself. Westermarck (Anthro- pological Essays presented to E. B. Tylor, p. 374) holds that the meal operates a transference of conditional curses to those concerned (and to the god if he is party to the convenant).

through holes to rub off evil or make them invisible to their foes, the use of sacrificing through a hole 1 naturally came into existence. 

In one other respect the magician avails himself of the forms of the ordinary sacrifice. One of the most important ingredients in every magic offering is the Sampata, the remnant of the butter offering made at the new and full moon, and the KauŚika Sūtra 2 contains precise instructions for the performance of these offerings, though it would be erroneous to imagine with Caland that every magic ceremony required to be accompanied by such a rite, a rule which would have restricted the workings of magic to a very short period. In the operations of his ceremonies the magician follows closely the ordinary rites of sacrifice: the person in whose interest he sacrifices takes stalks of Darbha grass and touches the priest with them to establish close contact with him, and smells the smoke of the oblations made in the fire by the priest. On the other hand, it is characteristic of the special nature of the rite that it is performed in the north-eastern quarter away from the village, and when it is completed the performers wash themselves in the stream near which the rite has been carried out, and return to the village, never turning round lest they may see the dread presences which they have evoked. The materials of the magic rite, apart from the frequent use of uneatable materials, are in the main the same as those of the ordinary ritual, but the diverse varieties of butter found in that ritual are replaced by the regular use of Ajya alone, while the Ingida is often mentioned as an ingredient.' Special interest attaches to the frequent use of earth from an ant-heap as we have seen, the ant, doubtless owing to its skill and industry, was regarded as an uncanny animal by the Vedic Indian, and possibly experience may have proved the existence of some value in the earth. An interesting excursion into the realm of sacrifice is made by this belief in the ceremony of the piling of the fire altar, when the clay for the making of the bricks has been collected, the priest is to gaze at it through an ant-heap, i.e. presumably through a tunnel made in such a heap. The explanation of this rite is obscure: Henry suggests comparison with the German superstition that by wearing a moleskin a man can see sorcerers: possibly the medium of an ant-heap conferred on the priests the faculty of discerning whether any evil influences were affecting his materials. Another curious ingredient is lead, and its three substitutes, iron filings, dried river foam, and a lizard's head. Woods of various kinds play a large part

the AŚvattha, which is often in fact employed in magic rites. But scarcely anything from an elephant's tooth or hair downwards comes amiss to the sorcerer, who in India as elsewhere is anxious to increase the importance of his action by asserting that his ingredients have been obtained from afar : an antidote against snakes is dug up on the ridges of the mountain with shovels of gold by the little Kiräta maiden, an assertion with which we may, if we will, compare the practice not rarely recorded, under which people of higher culture ascribe to those of lower culture possession of superior magic powers.3

In other respects the parallelism between sacrifice and magic ceremony is extremely close: in both cases the operator expects and receives a reward, but the KauŚika Sütra only rarely gives us an exact measure of the Dakṣiņā payable: in some cases the materials used may have been the fee. but often these would be too worthless or too valuable and it is reasonable to believe that the fee was usually fixed by agreement. The magic ceremony can serve most of the purposes of the formal sacrifice just as a main object of the regular offering is long life, so an infinity of charms provide life, and amulets of varied kinds are provided by the magician. There are spells for the house, to guard against fire, to bring rain, to secure increase of cattle, to pre- vent injury and increase the growth of crops, to secure safety on a journey or trade venture and success in gambling. Spells provide success in the assembly, bring victory in war, restore an exiled king, produce harmony or discord among the several classes of the people just as sacrifices do. Even more than sacrifice are magic ceremonies adapted to secure success in love, the over- throw of rivals, constancy between husband and wife, the birth of a son rather than of a daughter, safety in child-birth, and the protection of the life, always precarious and doubly so in such a climate as that of India, of the infant, and spells as well as sacrifices protect the whole adolescence and life of man. Specially rich in spells is the domain of medicine: remedies are provided in this way against many diseases, including intestinal worms, to which the Vedic Indian attributed many diseases with which they had no concern; fever whose several varieties were already known from their periods of recurrence; wounds and fractures, one formula used having some faint claim to be Indo- European in character; 6 skin affections including even leprosy; the effects of poison; and even perhaps diseases ranked as hereditary. The means employed are often obscure, and, while traces of some medical knowledge are not wanting the use of the probe has been recognized by Henry 10 and

The Magic Sacrifice

Caland1-in the main the spell seems to be relied on, together with symbolic acts for banishing, for example, the yellow jaundice to the yellow bird. 

A question of some difficulty presents itself as to the performers of these magic rites. Many of them are of such simplicity that it would appear obvious that they could be carried out by each householder for himself, for example, the rites to secure the safety of the cattle against wild beasts while grazing and their safe return at evening. Nor can we reasonably doubt that in the first instance the householder was his own magician as well as sacrificer. But in the KauŚika Sûtra, as is natural, we find it assumed throughout that the performer of the rite is essentially the Brahman priest, whose Veda the Atharvaveda essentially is, and that no rite has any value without his presence. We may, therefore, assume that by the time of the Sutra, and even earlier, the control of magic had largely fallen into the hands of these priests, and this fact accords well with their clearly increasing importance in the history of the sacrifice proper, in which the services of the Brahman in making good by his presence and his skill defects in the ritual win for him the credit of the performance of half the sacrifice. 

5

Henry, however, goes much further than this and insists that the Brahman was the first of priests, originally a magician, and that the spell is the primitive form whence prayer has emerged, as from the magician the priest has evolved with the growth of religion. Common as this view is, it is clear that it has no support in historical evidence, as in the Rigveda Brahman, both masculine and neuter, means normally priest and prayer, not magician and spell, and as a theory of religion it must be held to be as defective as are all theories which endeavour to develop religion from something essentially not religious.7 

8 

It is of interest to note that, while in the main the magician is content to use the Vedic pantheon as it appears in the sacrificial ritual, he is also pre- pared when necessary to fashion fresh figures or to modify those already existing. While Rudra in his forms as Bhava and Carva is invoked in a hymn against internal disease in terms which are suggestive of the popular favour which was to turn him into Śiva, the great god, Viṣņu takes an inferior place, though the representation of his three steps can be used to strengthen the magic act. The Apsarases appear in close connexion with dice, possibly as Henry 10 holds in the main because the term krid, 'play', applies to them par excellence: such linguistic considerations are of real importance in Vedic

thought. In battle charms we find not merely Apva, the spirit of panic and its physical result, but also Trişandhi, which is clearly Indra's bolt, Arbudi, and Nyarbudi, who is plainly but a verbal variant of the former.1 In Henry's view 2 Arbudi himself is a duplicate of Indra, like Namuci, but this view is much less probable than that of Bloomfield," who sees in him an old derivative of Arbuda, the cloud serpent slain by Indra, who comes to be regarded later merely as a serpent divinity and auspicious, like Takṣaka, who also figures in the Atharvaveda. It is characteristic of the Atharvaveda that Asura in independent passages has always an evil sense, that abstract deities like Arāti, illiberality towards priests, and perhaps Nirṛti, dissolution, take a pro- minent place, and that a faded mythological figure like the mysterious Trita appears, in the form Tṛta,' in connexion with a hymn which is interpreted as an expiation for the somewhat venial fault of marrying before an elder brother, a fact on which is based the theory of Max Müller, which Henry inclines to approve, that Tṛta is the departing sun. On the model of Puşan is created the god Süṣan, from su, 'beget', who is invoked to secure safe delivery."

One direct addition to our knowledge of the ordinary sacrificial ritual is made by the Atharvaveda, which in its last, late, book has a section of hymns styled collectively Kuntapa.10 The contents of this collection is very varied, but it includes several riddles, in part obscene, as well as a panegyric of a king: 11 doubtless we must assume that these are fragments of popular 12 merriment in connexion with sacrificial rites which have been stereotyped. 

In the sacrificial ritual, however, the most interesting of the innovations of the Atharvavedins is the introduction of rites regarding the presentation of the presents claimed by the priests. Instead of mere appendices to the actual offering, these become in themselves offerings of the highest importance and value.13 The other ritual texts 14 know of Savas as consecrations for various rites of importance, but in the KauŚika 15 the Sava is essentially the ceremony

Henry (La magie dans l'Inde antique,

which centres in the giving of largesse to the priests. The Atharvaveda has many hymns in connexion with these donations, two of which are noteworthy in connecting an prdinary Soma rite with the formal preparation and cooking of porridge for the priests, one preparer boasting that he is the fifteenth of his line who has performed the operation in other cases animals are the fees, and are extolled in the most exaggerated terms as divine: the goat recalls Aja Ekapad, that faded mythological figure of the Rigveda. In another case a house is taken to pieces and presented to the Brahman. A counterpart to these demands for fees is the stress laid on the sacred character of the Brahman: his wife is inviolable: nay Soma has made over to him his claim to the first mating with every woman. His cow is equally sacrosanct, and on the strength of his own sanctity he can demand, when such a portent as the birth of twin calves takes place, that the erring cow should be made over to him as alone fitted to be its master." 

## 9. Yoga Practices 

7 

The ritual, as has been seen, both in the case of magic and of the sacrifice, is full of elements which appear systematized in the later Yoga philosophy and practice. But it would be a mistake to exaggerate the degree of corre- spondence, and in point of fact much that is later characteristic and essential is lacking in the earlier Vedic literature. In special hardly any trace can be found of the importance later attaching to elaborate regulation of the breath, despite the fact that the division of the breaths or vital airs as five is early. The suggestion that the term Śuşma is a word with ecstatic implications is wholly implausible. The inducing of perspiration as a part of the Dikṣā and as a means of exciting ecstasy is clear, but it does not appear as a distinct or important rite as with the Scythians of Herodotos or the aborigines of North America or Australia. Nor do we find any clear reference to the various sitting postures familiar to the later Yoga, for it is absurd to believe that the sense altar', if it ever really belongs to the obscure term Dhiṣaṇā, owes its origin to the fact that by his posture at the place of sacrifice the priest beholds the might (dhiṣaṇa) of the gods. The mysterious Uttanapad of the Rigveda as a cosmic power cannot with any plausibility be deemed to yield a proof of the practice of assuming the position of an embryo in the womb as a means of attaining mystic rebirth. That silence and solitude were conducive to ecstasy is, curiously enough, little referred to, and the dirt of both person and garments of the later Yogin is recognized only in a few hints. There is more evidence of fasting, and the hymn of Lopamudra and Agastya in the Rigveda 10 1 AV. xi. 1; xii. 8.

Vedic Ritual 

[Part III 

appears, despite its obscurity, to express the two kindred ideas of the magic potency engendered by continence on the one hand, and on the other of the cosmic importance of the rite of generation, both doctrines of the later system.1 The idea of a mystic union between the god and the worshipper, which finds its highest development in the Śakti cults of Bengal, appears wholly unknown to Vedic literature, and dancing as a means of producing ecstasy is never mentioned, though the gods as dancers may be a relic of the conception. The songs, and their musical accompaniments, together with the ritual exclama- tions which are preserved in the Song-books of the Samaveda, may have served a similar purpose; sound may often have accomplished results of spiritual excitement irrespective of the words, and the term Vipra, used of the poet, seems to suggest the trembling or quaking of divine inspiration. 

More important than these facts is the striking description of the Muni found in one late Rigveda hymn. He differs entirely from the Brahman student or the man undergoing consecration, for his ecstasy is not connected either with the sacrifice or with any of the rites ancillary to it or to the entry of the youth into the full life of the community. His mortal body men see, but he himself fares on the path of the Apsarases, the Gandharvas, the beasts of the wild, he dwells in the east and the western ocean, the steed of Vata, the friend of Vayu, inspired by the gods. He knows secret desires, he is the dearest friend, he supports Agni and both the worlds, he is the heaven and the light, and his ecstasy, it seems, is due to a potent draught which, with Rudra, he drinks from a goblet, perhaps a reference to the use of some poison to pro- duce exhilaration or hypnosis. His hair is long, his soiled garments are of yellow hue.

This description is curiously isolated in the Rigveda and later, not un- naturally, since this aspect of religious life does not fall within the normal outlook of our texts. In the Atharvaveda, however, we find the curious and enigmatical figure of the Vratya, exalted into a cosmic power, and therefore of obscure origin. It has been suggested that we are to find in him the type of Yogin, produced in the eastern lands under the aegis of the Kṣatriyas, who wandered about the country, received with friendship in the courts, bringing prosperity in his train by reason of his ecstatic practices, in which a part was taken by the hetaera, who is made part of his retinue, and the Magadha whose loud cries doubtless played a part in his rites. The suggestion is ingenious, but unfortunately it lacks any probative value. The references to the year long standing of the Vratya and his other actions are too indistinct to enable us to discern with any certainty the outlines of an ancient seeker after ecstatic trances, and the elaboration of his retinue, though it may be paralleled in other lands, is strange to Indian usage.
