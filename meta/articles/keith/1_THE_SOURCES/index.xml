      <description>THE oldest and most important of the sources for Indian religion is the collection of 1,028 hymns known as the Rigveda Samhita, which has been handed down to us in the Śakala recension. Preserved in its early stages by oral tradition and long regarded as too sacred to be reduced to writing, the text affords abundant internal proof of the general accuracy with which it was preserved. Moreover, an invaluable form of control exists in the texts of the other Vedas, the Yajurveda in its different recensions, the Samaveda, and the Atharvaveda, all of which contain much of the matter of the Rigveda.</description>

      <description>ALREADY in the Rigveda there are signs of considerable elaboration of ritual and of the employment of a number of priests at the sacrifice, and the later Samhitās and the Brāhmaṇas reveal to us a time when the functions of the priesthood have been definitely divided up and apportioned among sets of priests. The manual acts of the sacrifice are ascribed to the Adhvaryu priest and his assistants and are accompanied by muttered formulae, in prose or verse, styled Yajus: in addition at the greatest sacrifices, such as the Soma sacrifice, singers chant Sāmans, and reciters recite Śastras, while the Brahman priest supervises the whole performance, usually in silence.</description>

      <description>FOR the latest stages of the Vedic religion on its practical side the authorities are the Śrauta and the Gṛhya Sūtras,1 which deal with different but complementary spheres, and which incidentally preserve for us a considerable amount of formulae, prose and verse, which by accident or other cause have not found a place in any of the Samhitās preserved to us. The necessity of some manuals for the actual practice of the great complicated rites of the sacrifice must have been felt from an early period, but we have not now extant any of these manuals.</description>
