      <description>AN effort definitely to establish the date of the reform of Iranian religion by Zoroaster has been made by J. Hertel,1 who seeks to trace the activity of the prophet from 559-522 B.C., a result of much importance in view of the probability that no very great interval of time can intervene between the Rigveda and the Gathas of the Avesta.
Stress is naturally laid by Hertel on the fact that the religion of the Persians as described by Herodotos contains nothing specifically Zoroastrian, while it accepts much that Zoroaster rejected, especially the direct veneration of nature gods, and the animal sacrifice; moreover Herodotos records the drunkenness of the Persians, which may be connected with the Haoma offering, the fear of defiling fire or water, and the practice of the Magoi of permitting the bodies of the dead to be torn by birds or beasts, matters which are not recognized in the Gathās.</description>

      <description>H. Gūntert1 has traced the common possession over an area extending from Germany, through the Thraco-Phrygian area, to the Indo-Iranians of a number of mythological elements, which are preserved for us in complex and contaminated forms in the religious records of these peoples. The first of these ideas is that of the origin of mankind and the world from the sacrifice of a primeval being, an idea suggested by the great potency which primitive religious thought ascribes to the bloody sacrifice.</description>

      <description>J. Hertel claims that in India and Iran alike we find the conception of the heaven as a great stone building, filled with light, through whose doors, the sun and the stars, the light of heaven shines upon men. For this view is adduced the reference in the Rigveda to the palace of Varuna with a thousand doors, which is asserted to be none other than the heaven with its stars.</description>

      <title>D THE DRINK OF IMMORTALITY</title>

G. Dumézil in his Le Festin d&amp;rsquo;Immortalité seeks to establish, despite the silence of the Veda, the existence of an Indo-European myth of the winning of the drink of immortality. From the epic legend of the churning of the ocean he derives a myth which tells how, in fear of death, the gods took counsel as to procuring a drink to preserve them from it. Visṇu advises them to churn the occan for it, and, after coming to terms with the demons, and obtaining the assent of the god of the ocean, they accomplish their end, producing the Amṛta, and other good things, including Lakṣmi; a poison engendered in the churning is drunk by Śiva, whose neck thus becomes blue.</description>

      <title>E THE INDO-EUROPEAN FIRE CULT</title>

      <description>625
That fire should be regarded in its own right as a divine power, worthy of worship, appears so natural that it is only reasonable to recognize such worship as Indo-European. The sanctity of Agni in the Rigveda is, of course, especially that of the fire regarded as the recipient of sacrifice and the bearer of oblations, but it seems wholly unjustifiable to suggest that his sanctity arose from his nature as the sacrificial fire; rather he was the recipient of offerings as sacred in his own right.</description>

      <title>F CREMATION AND BURIAL</title>

      <description>The view that cremation was a distinctively Indo-European form of disposal of the dead cannot be supported by any evidence of value. There is abundant proof that burial is at least as ancient a method, and, indeed, it is possible to hold that it was Indo-European, while burning was introduced after that period among the different peoples either independently or by borrowing. The Vedic evidence, as has been shown, proves that burial was early; Herodotos&amp;quot; ascribes the usage to the Persians, while the Magoi, possibly by religious conservatism, preserved the method of exposure; burial he also</description>

      <title>G THE DRAVIDIAN ELEMENT IN INDIAN THOUGHT</title>
      <link>https://vishvAsa.github.io/vedAH/meta/articles/keith/APPENDIX/G_THE_DRAVIDIAN_ELEMENT_IN_INDIAN_THOUGHT/</link>

      <guid>https://vishvAsa.github.io/vedAH/meta/articles/keith/APPENDIX/G_THE_DRAVIDIAN_ELEMENT_IN_INDIAN_THOUGHT/</guid>
      <description>The desire to prove that Dravidian or pre-Dravidian peoples affected deeply Vedic thought and life is natural, and is supported by the generally accepted view that the population of India is predominantly Dravidian or at least of non-Indo-European origin. It is true, however, that in the absence of any real certainty of the physical characteristics of the Indo-Europeans this belief cannot be made the subject of strict proof. Assuming, however, the validity of the doctrine, there remains the question whether the invaders were essentially responsible for the Vedic religion and philosophy, imposing a superior culture on inferior races, or whether the process as regards culture was reversed; instances of analogical cases can be easily adduced.</description>

U. von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff holds that in the doctrine of Philolaos the five bodies in the sphaira are the four elements, which compose it, with as fifth râs opaipas Akós in the sense of that which gives the sphaira its form, the nature of that something being only vaguely felt; in the Timaios Plato makes the world-soul perform an analogous function. He insists that it is to Aristotle we must look for the conception of the ether as a fifth element, for he evidently deliberately claims this as his own invention.</description>
