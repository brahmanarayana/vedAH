## 1. Agni 

AGNI is clearly in the eyes of the priest only second to Indra in importance: in the Rigveda he has some 200 hymns for himself alone.1 From Indra, how- ever, he is essentially distinguished by his nature; he is intimately connected with the element of which he is the deity, and his nature is therefore far less anthropomorphic; moreover, what there is of human in him is derived, not from the conception of the warrior god, but from that of the ideal priest: if both gods are expected to send fortune and happiness to their votaries, Indra gives rather victory in battle and power, Agni the prosperity and happi- ness of the home. Moreover, while Agni is assimilated in much to Indra and as usual is accorded several of his feats and his powers, Indra remains compara- tively unaffected by the qualities of Agni. Indra also is not, like Agni, the messenger between gods and men, an office, which, if it makes Agni in some ways a god of the closest intimacy with the life of men, still does tend to reduce his status, and renders him in some sense inferior to the other gods. Nor is Soma the normal drink of Agni: he is indeed a Soma-drinker, but only in a minimal degree for a great god, and often because of his connexion with Indra. 

The appearance of Agni is clearly merely a description of the fire, and in one passage he is truly called headless and footless: elsewhere he is called butter-faced, butter-backed, butter-haired, flame-haired or tawny-haired. He has three or seven tongues, which receive in the later literature names of their own; his steeds are similarly given seven tongues. He has butter for his eye, four or a thousand eyes, and a thousand horns. He is also an archer. He is likened to, or identified with, a bull or horse or bird, an eagle or Hansa : even once he is called a raging serpent. Again he 2 is a hatchet or a car.

His food is ghee, but he also devours the woods, and eats thrice a day. Or he is the mouth by which the gods eat the sacrifice. He is invoked to come to sit on the strew to receive the offerings for himself, or the gods. 

Agni's brightness is often mentioned; he is like the sun, dispels darkness, and bears the epithet' waking at dawn'. But, when he drives through the forest, shaving the earth like a barber a beard, his path is black. His flames roar terribly, and his light reaches the sky. But he has also a car drawn by two or more horses, with which he brings the gods to receive the offerings of 

men.

Agni's mythic parents are Dyaus and Pṛthivi, or Tvastṛ and the Waters. But he is also produced by the gods whose father, however, he is; he is brought into existence by Indra or Indra and Viṣņu, or by the Dawn, and is the son of Ida, the personification of the sacrificial food. All these accounts are open to obvious explanations and are of no consequence. More important is the birth from the two fire sticks, the upper being deemed the male, the lower the female, and in mythical form being described as Purŭravas and Urvaśi, from that famous pair of lovers. They are also called two mothers, and many plays on the curious infant and his mothers occur.1 As friction is engendered by the action of the hands in turning the one stick in the other, he is credited with ten mothers, the ten fingers. As force is needed for his production, Agni is the son of strength. He is born ever new and is called the youngest, but still is old as being born for ever. Here and there occurs, in the Brāhmaṇa litera- ture, the idea that the fire at the end of a year is outworn, but the idea that the fire is at the beginning of each year to be for ally renewed in a special rite is not to be recognized. For the sacrifices such as the Agniṣṭoma, the four- monthly rites, and the animal offering, the fire is solemnly produced anew by friction, but there is no evidence that the winter solstice was felt to be a time when the fire as such was in need of any special renewal. If such an idea existed, it has not left any clear trace in Vedic ritual. 

As Agni springs from the wood, it is regularly stated that he dwells in plants. On earth too he has a place in the navel (nābhi) of the earth, a reference doubtless to the hole in the high place of offering in which the fire is deposited: hence Agni is the navel of immortality. 

Agni is also born from the waters: he is the embryo of the waters, kindled in the waters, a bull who has waxed great in the waters, and he descends from the clouds. In these cases it is probable that the waters of the clouds are meant in this aspect he is Apāṁ Napāt, who has become practically a separate deity. On the other hand, there is a widely prevalent view that the waters are terrestrial: several late hymns of the Rigveda tell of the flight of Agni because of unwillingness to perform the sacrifice, and his being found among the waters and the plants, and this legend is a common-place of the Brāhmaṇa period. In the Atharvaveda the Agni in the waters is clearly dis- tinguished from the lightning, and is made terrestrial. The Rigveda itself recognizes the existence of Agni in the streams. In the ritual there are many traces of the same view of Agni as in waters other than those of the clouds. 

1 The long period of gestation (RV. v. 2) is 

probably an allusion to the long latency of fire in the wood, ere evoked by fric- tion. The old mode of lighting the fire was preserved in the rite of re- kindling on March 1 the fire of Vesta in Rome and in the occasional use of this method in kindling the  ́ need fire in Germany (von Schroeder, Arische 

Religion, ii. 596 f.). 

• Hillebrandt, Ved. Myth. ii. 77 ff. Cf. his theory of Dawn as the Goddess of a New Year (above, Part II, Chap. 8, § 7). Cf. von Schroeder (Arische Religion, ii. 485), who regards Agni as reborn at the opening of spring, comparing the return of Apollo in spring (p. 528).156

[Part II 

At the dedication of tanks of water and similar rites, offerings are made to Agni in the waters; the Brahman student, when he performs the bath marking the end of his period of pupilship, takes water from a vessel, appropriating to himself the bright form of Agni and repelling the other forms of Agni, which have entered into the water. The waters used at the royal consecration are regarded as being full of Agni. In the ceremony of the piling of the fire altar, when it is desired to diminish the heat of Agni, cooling plants and a frog are placed on the altar, and Agni is asked to enter the waters of which he is the gall. It is clear, therefore, that the view that Agni is con- nected with the waters of the earth is an old one, but it must be noted that at no period is his connexion with the waters of the air forgotten: we find it expressly asserted in a Sūtra 5 text which shows that it was perfectly well understood. It is impossible, therefore, to accept the view of Oldenberg that the connexion of Agni in the terrestrial waters is the normal one, as opposed to the Agni of the aerial waters: both conceptions are clearly found equally authenticated. The explanation of the belief in the presence of Agni in the terrestrial waters may be a transfer from the belief in his presence in the aerial waters, but it can also be accounted for in other ways. Thus the phenomenon of the lightning coming down to and entering the waters may well have played a more important part than the more elaborate idea, clearly valid for the Brāhmaṇa period, which sees in the plants the closest connexion with the waters, and which pictures a cycle from the water to the plants, from the plants to the flame, from the flame to the smoke, from the smoke to the cloud, and thence to the water again. 

6 

In the third place Agni has a birth in the heaven; he is born there and was brought down by Matariśvan, who is doubtless his lightning form. The Aitareya Brāhmaṇa calls him at once heavenly and in the waters. Agni, however, is often as the god contrasted with the lightning. Agni as heavenly is the sun, born in the morning. The Aitareya says that on setting the sun enters into Agni, and in the Rigveda o Agni unites himself with the rays of the sun. But this side of the nature of Agni is little referred to: the sun was too great and prominent a deity to be treated merely as a form of Agni. 

7 

The three births of Agni are constantly referred to: he is made threefold, has three heads, tongues, stations. The order of his abodes is variously stated, as heaven, earth, the waters; or earth, heaven, the waters; or sky, air, and earth. Hence we must doubtless trace the view of the Nairuktas preserved for us by Yäska,' which makes the whole Vedic pantheon reducible to the three gods, Agni, Indra or Vāyu, and Surya. The second member of the triad must be taken to have replaced the lightning, which would be more easy, since the lightning has no mythic name to give it substance, and, therefore, the god

of the middle space is better represented by a deity of more concrete nature. On the other hand, it would be an error to underestimate the importance of lightning in Vedic mythology, on the ground that it is too transient in character to serve as the basis of mythology.1 

2 

Still more important is the fact that the three forms of Agni explain the practice that in the ritual Agni is worshipped on three altars, the Gārhapatya, the Ahavaniya, and the Dakṣiņa, which are kept quite distinct from the ordinary household fire. The alternative view that these fires are to be regarded as the source of the myth of the three forms of Agni can hardly be taken seriously. More plausible is connexion with fire as the sun, as domestic, and as driving away evil spirits, as von Schroeder suggests.3 

Though the birth of Agni is most often triple, yet in many passages he is given but two births, the one on earth, the other in the sky, or, less often, the one in heaven and the other in the waters. The idea is already found in the Rigveda that Agni descends into the waters, and that from the plants he arises again, and, from the distinction of the aspects of fire, we arrive at the frequent Vedic idea that the god is to sacrifice to himself, or bring himself to the sacrifice, or descend with the gods to the sacrifice. Moreover, by another view Agni is kindled not only by men or earth, but by the gods in heaven : * this doubtless points at once to the necessity of some kindler for the Agni of the heaven as for him of earth, and to the tendency to see in the gods the pre- cise analogues of pious sacrificers among men. But from yet another point of view Agni is manifold, since there are many fires on earth: the unity of the conception, however, as in the case of Dawn triumphs: the other fires are likened to the branches of the tree, Agni. This manifold nature of his origin is sometimes developed in detail, as when he is said to be born from the heavens, the waters, stones, woods, and plants. The rock whence it is born may be the stone from which he is struck out or the cloud: he dwells also in man as animal heat, in beast and birds, in biped and quadruped." He is the germ therefore of all that is. 

The three births of Agni give rise to the legend of his three brothers, or his brothers generically, who again with him make up the four Hotṛs, of whom three die according to the Kāṭhaka Samhitā." The legend of death seems purely imaginative. Of the gods Varuņa is once his brother, and Indra is his twin brother. From Indra Agni borrows, as we have seen, some of his feats, such as vanquishing the Panis. In one hymn Agni is mentioned with Soma. He lends himself also to identifications with other gods: thus in the evening he is Varuna, rising in the morning Mitra, as Savitṛ he traverses the air, as 

1 Oldenberg, Rel. des Veda', pp. 112 f.; Hardy, Ved.-brahm. Periode, p. 64; Hillebrandt, Ved. Myth. i. 368 ; ii. 129 ff. * It is connected with the dead, and they with the winds and the air. Hence it corresponds to the aerial, as the Aha- vaniya to the celestial Agni.

The Gods and Demons of the Veda 

[Part II 

Indra he illumines the sky; so the Atharvaveda 1 tells us. He has various forms and many names, he embraces all the gods, and once even in the Rigveda he is successively identified with twelve gods and five goddesses. 

Agni is not without martial traits, but his activity is quite different from that of Indra, who wars on the Asuras and on the Dāsas. Agni is in place of that the destroyer of the demons; with iron teeth he consumes the sorcerers, he drives away the goblins, he is the slayer of Rakṣases par excellence. Indra borrows this feature of his character from him, and it is also attributed to the Aśvins, Bṛhaspati, and Soma, but the primary claim of fire to destroy the wizards and the demons is an obvious one, and recorded by anthropology over all the earth. It is also most strongly attested in the ritual. 

The domestic side of the fire worship is revealed mainly by the constant reference to Agni as the friend in the homes of men, whence comes his de- scription as father, or brother, or son, or even mother. He has the epithet domestic, and is styled lord of the house. He is the immortal who abides among mortal in human habitations. He is further the protector of settlers, the man who makes mortals to settle down, and he is the lord of the clan (vicpati). The close relation of men to him is attested by the fact that we hear expressly of the Agni of Bharata, of Devavāta, of Divodāsa, of Trasadasyu, and of Vadhryaśva. His relation to the Añgirases and the Bhṛgus may have been mythical, but were not so conceived in all probability in Vedic times, and he certainly stood in close relation to families like the Vasisthas. His connexion with Aryan settlement is told clearly in the legend of the advance of the Aryans to the east under the guidance of Gotama Rāhūgaṇa and Videgha Mathava, the latter of whom has been compared rashly with Prometheus; the story preserves in the clearest way possible the record of the essential connexion between the introduction of the fire cult, and the advance of Aryan settlement and of Aryan culture. 

The ritual hardly gives a clear picture of these aspects of the character of Agni as the domestic friend and father, and as the protector and leader of the people. In it stress is laid in the main on the ritual of the three fires of the more elaborate sacrifices performed for an individual, and this elaboration is old, since in the Rigveda, while the name of only one of the later fires expressly occurs, that of the Garhapatya, there are references to the later practice of transporting the fire from one altar to another: thus Agni is said to be led round, to go round the sacrifice three times, to be led east and then west. But the importance of the domestic fire, which can be assumed for the earliest period, and which is preserved in some degree in the domestic ritual, is also attested by the fact that in the later ritual, and perhaps also in the earlier, the fire was first placed on the Garhapatya altar, a name which indicates that the

real domestic fire was the starting-point of the late development. There are fainter traces of the worship of fire not merely by an individual, but as the fire of the clan or community. In the later ritual we hear of the fire of the Sabha and the Avasatha, which were respectively the council-house and a place of reception for those who came to the Sabha, as it seems, and it may be conjectured from the fact that the word Sabhya as an epithet of fire is found in the Atharvaveda, though not in the Rigveda, that we are entitled to con- ceive of the fire as being lighted in the Sabhä for the cult of the clan or com. munity on the solemn occasions of the meeting of the people in council. There are parallels among other peoples of the Indo-European stock, and among the Iranians where such fires as those of the head of the clan and of the canton were known, but in the case of the Rigveda, the traces are scanty, unless stress can be laid on the term ' lord of the clan' applied to the god, and the title of king of the clans of men. It is, however, notorious that the Sabha, which appears as a real institution in the Rigvede, in the later period disappears, and is reduced at most to a small council, first of warriors and priests and then of priests only, so that it is possible that an earlier public cult disappeared in the course of time. Analogy suggests this conclusion, which is merely rendered doubtful by the imperfection of the evidence which can be adduced to prove the positive existence of the cult. 

On the other hand we have abundant references to the activities of Agni as a sacrificer, and he serves as the model for sacrificers. He is an essential element in the transmission of the sacrifice to the gods who cannot enjoy it without him. On the one hand he brings the gods down to the sacrifice and seats them on the strew that they may enjoy the food and drink offered. On the other hand he bears the oblation to the gods in the heaven. In either case he is constantly serving as an envoy between the gods and men, and is especially often called the messenger of men, though also that of Vivasvant. The Yajurveda elevates him into the messenger of the gods, and places over against him Kavya Uśanas as the messenger of the Asuras. A Brāhmaṇa * deals with him, not as the messenger of, but as the path leading to the gods, He is called the Hotṛ, the Adhvaryu, the Brahman, and Purohita of the gods, thus combining in himself all the activities of the human priest. He is thus the one most fitted to worship the gods, he makes the oblations fragrant. But there is also a tradition that he wearied of his office, and required to be induced by promise of rich reward to be the bearer of the oblation." It seems that he had to be found in the waters and the plants, and that he was

[Part II 

reluctant to undertake the duties. Hillebrandt,1 who thinks that the reluctance was connected with the death of his brothers, which is not, however, quite clearly referred to in the Rigveda and which may be only a later myth, and of independent origin, deduces from the story the view that it refers to the contrast between the two periods of the year, the northern and the southern course of the sun, Uttarāyaṇa and Dakṣiṇāyana, Devayana and Pitṛyāṇa, and that the legend explains the winning back of Agni at the end of the southern course of the sun, at the period of the winter solstice. He inter- prets the waters into which Agni retires as the fate of the sun at the winter solstice, an idea which, however, in India he considers to have been absorbed in that of the rainy season. The conjecture unhappily lacks any verisimilitude: the picture of the bringing of Agni to work seems no more than the conception of an individual poet of the constant theme of the mode, in which Agni comes to be employed as the sacrificer on earth. 

3 

In connexion with the sacrifice three forms of Agni are distinguished in the Yajurveda,2 the eater of raw flesh, the eater of corpses, and the sacrificial, and this distinction is perfectly well known in the Rigveda 3 so far as concerns the Agni which bears the offering, and the Agni which devours the bodies of the dead. The term kravyäd alternates in the Rigveda with kravyavāhana, later kavyavāhana, and a fire named kavyavāhana, appears as invoked with Yama at an offering to the Manes, which is performed on the afternoon of the new moon sacrifice at the last of the four-monthly offerings. From these facts Hillebrandt deduces the theory that from the fire, with which the dead was burned, there was taken a brand to rekindle the fire for the Manes, which he believes to have existed in the time of the Rigveda under the title of the Naraśañsa. The procedure is clearly wholly contrary to the spirit of the ritual, which regards death as requiring the extinction of all fires which are made thereby impure, and the evidence adduced for the theory is obviously inadequate to make it even plausible. 

4 

Another division of the forms of Agni is given by the Taittiriya Samhita," where the Agni which bears the oblation is distinguished from that which bears the funeral offering, called kavyavāhana, and that associated with the goblins (saharakṣas). 

As a sacrificer Agni has this advantage over the human sacrificer that he does not make mistakes, and if he errs in any way he can put all right. Hence he is all knowing, the sage, possessed of all wisdom, and exclusively bears the epithet Jātavedas,* used about 120 times of him in the Rigveda and explained there as he who knows all generations, though some modern scholars prefer the sense 'having innate wisdom'. The priest prays, therefore, to him to accord him power of memory and wisdom. He produces wisdom, and is himself eloquent, 1 Hillebrandt, Ved. Myth. ii. 187 ff. Von Schroeder (Arische Religion, ii. 528) compares Apollonine legend, but with- out plausibility.

and a cause of eloquence in others. In all other matters too he befriends his worshippers, he gives food, wealth, long life, he defeats enemies, and demons: even in battle he leads the van, which may be a reference to the carrying of fire before the host in its onslaught. He is also occasionally given the power to remit sin, to make guiltless before Aditi, to avert the anger of Varuņa,1 and in the later texts he is said to free from the crimes committed by man's father and mother.2 

Agni is also as a great god magnified by being declared to be above all the gods: Varuna, Mitra, the Maruts, and all the gods worship him. He delivers the gods in battle, he defeats the Dasyus for the Aryan, he vanquished the Panis and is even called breaker of forts and Vṛtra-slayer, but these aspects of his are really derived from Indra. He measures out the air and supports the vault of heaven like all the greater deities, but he has a special function of his own, the strengthening of the sun when at the Agnihotra in the morning he is produced. This is recognized occasion ally in the Rigveda and quite frankly in the Brāhmaṇa literature. But in many cases the two acts are regarded merely as simultaneous, and the later texts discuss the question whether the Agnihotra is to be offered just before or just after the sun rise. 

Agni is said to have produced men as also are other gods, but this relation- ship is neither often mentioned nor prominent. It is not probable that it stood in any special relation to the act of producing Agni from the fire sticks, though that act was naturally enough compared to the production of life: it lies rather in his close association with the worship of the family, which brings him into close contact with men. 

The derivation of Agni's name, Latin ignis, Lithuanian ugnis, is un- certain, though connexion with aj, ‘ drive ', is not impossible. In the Avesta the name is unknown as such and it does not appear among the Mitanni gods, which speaks in favour of the view that it is a specific development of the Indian priest. But the worship of fire itself, apart from the special concep- tion of it as Agni, is undoubtedly strongly marked in the period of the unity of the Indo-Iranians. The fire in the Avesta is the centre of a strong and developed ritual: the fire priests Athravans are clearly the same in origin as the Vedic Atharvans, and Ãtar must have been conceived as a great and powerful god, giver of food, of fame, of offspring, the friend of the house, the repeller of foes, probably known as in the lightning and the plant-born forms. Oldenberg holds that, as in Greece and in Rome Hestia and Vesta are

feminine, there cannot have been an early Indo-European worship of fire of any distinct character. This is true so far as the personification of the fire is concerned, but the close connexion of the fire with the home which is em- phasized by these two faiths, and which is also in harmony with the indica- tions of Vedic religion, suggests that the cult of fire must have been a very real one in the Indo-European period, a conclusion the more natural if, as is probable, the original home of the Indo-European is to be placed in a com- paratively cold climate.1 The stress laid on the fire in India would, therefore, be changed in emphasis, as not the domestic, but the sacrificial fire became the more important in a land where the sun provided for many things which elsewhere fire was required to accomplish. 

## 2. Bṛhaspati and other forms of Agni 

Bṛhaspati is a god of much importance in the eyes of the Rigveda, since it devotes to him eleven hymns and mentions him, under that name or as Brahmanaspati, about 170 times. He forms with Indra a pair in two hymns. But his character appears very clearly as a compound of the activities of other gods. Thus his appearance is like that of Agni: he has seven mouths, seven rays, a beautiful tongue, he is bright, pure, ruddy, and clear-voiced. He has sharp horns and a hundred wings; he carries an iron axe, wrought by Tvaṣtr, or a golden hatchet, and rides on a car with ruddy steeds. But he is marked out by having a bow whose string is Ṛta, which here doubtless refers to the holy rite, the sacrifice, showing that his weapons are also priestly. He is said to have been born from great light in the highest heaven, and with thunder to have dispelled the darkness, but also to be the half of the two worlds or of Tvaṣṭr, and he is the producer of the gods. 

Bṛhaspati is especially the divine priest; he is the Purohita, but also the Brahman, and the Brāhmaṇas constantly play on his position as the Brahman priest or the Brahman, the holy power', of the gods. In the later texts as Brahman he is probably denoted as the technical priest of that name, who oversees the sacrifice and, like Agni, is able by his invention to make good any defects which he may observe in the sacrifice. In the Rigveda the technical sense is doubtful: the Brāhmaṇācchansin priest may, however, be meant in one or two cases. He sings hymns, metre is his, he has singing hosts and thence is called Ganapati, a term once given to Indra. He is, as his name denotes, the lord of prayer, the generator of prayer which he communicated to

8 

theft of fire (Prometheus, Loki) is only faintly seen in the figure of Mätariśvan (Chap. 9, § 6) and possibly that of Bhrgu (Chap. 19, § 1).

men: hence in the later texts he is lord of speech, Vacaspati, a name which is specially his in post-Vedic literature. 

3 

Brhaspati is often named beside Agni, but he is not rarely identified with him: 1 he is given three abodes, is called son of strength, associated with Naraśansa, Matariśvan and the Añgirases. He is lord of the dwelling, while Agni for his part is called lord of prayer. Like Agni, however, he is associated with Indra, and becomes specially connected with the myth of the overthrow of Vala and the release of the cows, in which he acts with his singing host. He splits the mountains, drives out and distributes the cows, and the Atharva- veda makes his conquest of Vala proverbial. In winning the cows he finds the light, the Dawn, and Agni. He is also said to roar like a bull, to shatter forts, to overthrow Vṛtras and conquer foes. He is even given the epithet of bolt-bearer and is made a friend of the Maruts. He has also the more general traits of being a bestower of wealth and long life, a remover of disease, and a father. He stimulates also the life of the plants, through him the sun and moon rise alternately, and in the Yajurveda he is made the regent of the constellation Tiṣya, while in post-Vedic literature he is the ruler of Jupiter.”,

It is clear that the name was held by the Rigvedic poets to be derived from a word brh in the sense of Brahman, prayer, as it is parallel with Brahmanas- pati, and the meaning of the name is, therefore, lord of prayer or devotion.) The great similarity to Agni, which makes Bṛhaspati in much merely his double, can best be explained on the theory that Bṛhaspati is Agni in his priestly form, but that the connexion was one early developed. The most plausible of alternative views is undoubtedly that of Roth," which takes the god as a direct personification of the power of devotion, and Oldenberg develops a similar idea in insisting that Bṛhaspati is the typical priest who assists in the feats of the gods by his songs and his prayers. In that case it is necessary to suppose that he has won to himself the attributes of the gods by his close association with them in their activities, a view to which there is no good ground of objection in itself, but which is on the other hand not in any way more probable than the idea that the name was at first an epithet of the god. On the other hand Weber and Hopkins start from the marked similarity to Indra in the warlike deeds of Bṛhaspati, and make him out to be derived from the character of Indra modified under the views of the priesthood: " this view is also legitimate, but is subject to the objection that on the whole it is easier to explain the development, if the Agni side be taken as the standing

point in the discussion of the nature of the god. It is, however, impossible to accept the efforts of Hillebrandt to prove that Bṛhaspati is the moon, especially as a god of magic and the magic southern fire; the long list of parallels with Soma which he adduces will on investigation be found merely to refer either to points which are commonplaces of many Vedic gods, or to points in which Agni and Soma agree. The fact that Bṛhaspati produces effects on the plants is wholly inadequate to make out that he is a moon god, for there is no very clear trace in the Rigveda of the doctrine that all growth or even that most growth is due to the action of the moon: the heat and the water which are characteristic of Agni are essentially connected with plant life. 

The chief importance of Bṛhaspati lies in the fact that he is in the earlier Vedic period the root from which sprung the god Brahman, who appears first in the later stratum of the Brāhmaṇa texts. 

3 

While the identity of Bṛhaspati with Agni has been obscured by the development of the character of the deity, the identity of Vaiśvanara is made absolutely certain by the constant mention of Agni under that epithet in the Rigveda. It denotes 'pertaining to all men', and is normally believed to refer to Agni in all his aspects, celestial as well as terrestrial. In point of fact, however, the mention of Vaiśvānara is mainly in certain definite contexts. He appears in connexion with the descent of celestial fire and the agency of the Bhrgus and Mätariśvan, and once 3 Agni Vaiśvānara is styled Mātariśvan. In the Brāhmaṇas Vaiśvānara has a direct reference to the sun in the fact that it is said that Agni Vaiśvänara is the year, and that cakes offered on twelve potsherds are frequently presented to him. Vaiśvānara appears also in com- parison with the Maruts as connected with the princely rank: the Dhruva cup which is offered to Vaiśvānara is guarded by a prince, and is employed in a variety of rites for the preservation or restoration of lordly power. It is clear also that in these texts the fire specially related to Vaiśvānara is the Ahavaniya, so that we have a good warrant for seeing in the god a form of the sun, which on earth has a counterpart in the Ahavaniya fire. This explains well the controversy which existed even in early days regarding the nature of the god: it was maintained by the Yājñikas that Vaiśvānara was the sun, while Çakapūņi, with whom in effect Yāska agrees, held that he was the terrestrial Agni. Vaiśvänara would then be a suitable epithet of the sun, who is common to all men and seen of all.

The name Narāśansa is also used of the god, and with it is connected one of the great ritual distinctions of the Vedic ritual: some families took in the Apri hymns, used at fore-offerings in the ritual of the animal sacrifice, a verse

addressed to Naraśañsa, others took in place Tanünapät, while only a few families, such as that of Medhätithi Kāṇva and Dirghatamas Aucathya, solved the dispute by including invocations of both in the hymns. In the long run the tradition of the Jamadagni family prevailed and their invocation of Tanünapāt was accepted, the Vasistha family, however, remaining faithful to their invocation of Naraśañsa. The god has little that is characteristic about him in the Rigveda: he thrice a day sprinkles the sacrifice with honey; he anoints the three heavens and the gods. Soma is said to go between Narāśansa and the celestial one, which may refer to the contrast of terrestrial and celestial fires. In the Brāhmaṇas there is more distinct information : five cups are styled Nārāśansa, two at each of the first two pressings and one at the third after being tasted by the priests they are placed on the south oblation-holder. The epithet drunk by Naraśansa' is used of Soma in connexion with an offering to the Fathers, and the connexion of Naraśansa and the Fathers appears in one passage in the Rigveda, which may conceiv- ably point to the later ritual having been in this respect known to the Rigveda. Moreover in two hymns Naraśañsa seems to be identified with Bṛhaspati. On this ground Hillebrandt concludes that Naraśañsa is a designation of a moon god of the dead, equivalent to Bṛhaspati, and of the Dakṣiņa fire for the Fathers. He strengthens this view by pointing out that in a Brāhmaṇa text? the term three-headed and six-eyed is applied to Naräśansa, which would seem to identify him with Viśvarupa, son of Tvaștṛ, who, like Bṛhaspati, is in his opinion the moon as the home of the Fathers. The conjecture, however, is too bold, and rests upon the mistaken identification of Bṛhaspati and the moon, and the still less plausible version of Viśvarupa as the moon. It neces- sitates also the making of the word to mean he who praises men', applicable to a judge of the Fathers, instead of ' praise of men' in the sense' praised by men', which is the more natural sense. The comparison of the Avestan Nairyosanha leads to no further conclusion: traces of connexion with the Fathers are seen by Hillebrandt, but they are very faint, and his chief certain characteristic is that of messenger, which makes him merely a normal form of

Agni. It is impossible, therefore, to say more than that Naraśansa is a form of Agni: Bergaigne 1 thinks that he is specifically a god of prayer like Bṛhaspati, and this accords with the identification of the two gods which seems certainly intended by the Vedic poets. 

$ 

Tanûnapăt is even more obscure than Naraśansa. His name means either son of his self', a reference to the fact that Agni generates Agni, fire being sui generis, or‘own son ', i. e. of the divine father as suggested by Bergaigne.* He is contrasted with Naraśansa and Mätariśvan as the divine embryo. The dawns kiss Agni, the Tanûnapāt of the ruddy one. He takes the sacrifice to the gods: Varuna, Mitra, Agni honour him thrice a day. Who is meant is impossible to say: Hillebrandt, who once identified him with Agni as a guardian of the Soma and as lunar fire, has abandoned the suggestion: in the Brāhmaṇas he is variously identified with summer and Indra, while in the ritual he plays a part only in the Tânûnaptra ceremony in which the patron and the celebrants of the rite engage not to injure one another: in this rite he serves, it seems, as the god who watches over the fulfilment of the mutual oaths of fidelity. 

4 

Closely connected with Agni are other figures: the gods Mätariśvan, Ahi Budhnya, Aja Ekapād are in some degree associated with him, and the priestly families of the Atharvans, Bhṛgus, and Añgirases are closely related to him: they will be considered later together with the other families of priests, to whom they are perhaps more closely related in origin than to the god himself. 

## 3. The God Soma 

The poetry of the Rigveda is mainly connected with the Soma sacrifice, and this fact must be borne in mind in estimating the importance of the god Soma. In its present form the whole of the ninth book of the Samhitā is devoted to him and he has six hymns in other books: moreover he is invoked in parts of four or five others, and also as a joint deity with Indra, Agni, Püṣan and Rudra. The number of times his name occurs is incapable of accurate calculation, as the name is constantly mentioned without it being possible to say whether the god is really referred to. 

Soma resembles Agni in the fact that the anthropomorphism of the god is constantly coming into collision with the actual form of the plant and thus is prevented from attaining any clear development. Hence myths of a concrete character cannot spring up around the name, and the deeds which are given to Soma are simply borrowed by him from the other gods, especially Indra and Agni, with whom he is very nearly associated, since the former is the great Soma drinker and the latter for his part is a god of ritual like Soma. But on

the other hand the Soma is the great object of priestly interest, and the most elaborate imagery seems to have formed round the simple operations of pressing and straining the juice: the monotony of the ninth book is only equalled by its obscurity in detail, and, it must be admitted, much of the obscurity hides no real depth of thought but merely puerile fancies. 

For the juice pressed from the Soma plant the Rigveda offers various names, such as andhas, applied also to the whole plant, pitu, and often mada, the intoxicating beverage; it is even called food, and very often honey, a term which is applied also to milk and to ghee. 

* 

Frequently it is Amṛta, ambrosia ' the drink of immortality, or milk, or the wave from the stalk, or the juice of honey. A common name of the plant and the drink is Indu, the bright drop. The plant is brown, ruddy or most often tawny, and, in accord with this, it is the rule that the cow, with which in the rite the Soma is purchased, must be brown or ruddy, and that any sub- stitutes used for Soma must be similar to it in colour. The plant is made to yield its juice by being pounded with a stone or pressed with stones, which lie on a skin and seem in contravention to the ritual usage to be placed on the altar.1 The stones are called adri or gråvan, the latter usually employed with verbs meaning to speak and therefore more mythical than the word adri. It is almost, if not quite certain, that the extraction of the juice by pounding with a pestle in a mortar was known to the Rigveda 2 as well as the normal pounding with stones which is repeatedly mentioned: the Avestan ritual knows the use of mortar and pestle in connexion with the Haoma. When pounded the juice is strained through a sieve, which is called a skin, hair, wool, filter, or metaphorically perhaps ridge. In this state Soma wins the title Pavamāna, under which, as becoming clear, it is celebrated in the ninth book of the Rigveda. In the purified form it is called Çukra or Çuci, 'the bright,' and is offered in this shape to Indra and Văyu, who is the drinker of the pure Soma par excellence, a fact which is confirmed by the ritual where the un- mixed Soma is reserved for Indra and Vayu, while it is mixed with milk for Mitra and Varuna and with honey for the Aśvins. It is clear that after the purifying process Soma was often mixed with water: so in the ritual the pressing is followed by the mixing of water (ädhavana). Water however does not bear the technical name of äśir, which is reserved for the milk, fresh or curdled, and the barley with which Soma clothes himself as with a garment. The refreshing of the stalks of the plants with water, which is known in the later ritual as the Apyāyana, is possibly but not certainly, referred to in the Rigveda. The three offerings of the Rigveda3 correspond in some measure at least to those of later times: Indra is present at both the morning pressing

and at the midday pressing which is his alone, whence it later has a Çastra called Niskevalya, and the Rbhus have a place in the third offering. The term of three abodes' given to the god may allude to three tubs of the ritual, but this is uncertain, and the same doubt attends the three Soma lakes, of which mention is made, as drunk by Indra. The three backs of the god are probably the three admixtures. 

1 

So much of the mythology of Soma is clear enough: the actual plant lies immediately behind the god, and explains his characteristics. But there are other traits which show that the plant is a very powerful one. The waters which are mixed with the Soma give rise to many metaphors, and Soma is said to be the producer of the waters, and to be born of the waters: he streams rain from the sky, and he flows clearly with a stream of honey like the cloud full of rain. He is the father of the waters as well as their son, and the Soma seems in some cases to be deemed to be rain. The Çatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1 directly identifies the ambrosia with the water. The sound of the pouring of the Soma is likened to thunder, and lightning is associated with the process. Again, as a thunderer and a loud-sounding god, Soma is a bull and the waters are his cows: he fertilizes the waters. He is a sharp-horned bull. But he is also for his swift flow a steed or bird, and again he is identified for his bright colour with the sun, and made to dispel the darkness and defeat it. In all this there is clearly evident the fact that Soma is no mere plant on earth, but is in addition a great celestial deity. 

The same double side of Soma appears in the legends which make him drunk by the gods as well as by men. He is for both the drink of immortality, which makes them live for ever. In less exalted phrase he is of high value in healing, he makes the blind to see, and the lame to walk. He even destroys sin and promotes truth: in vino veritas. He inspires speech and so Soma is lord of speech: he has all wisdom and knowledge. He surveys all things with his thousand eyes. 

A votary declares * We have drunk the Soma, we have become immortal, we have attained the light, we have known the gods.' The Fathers too love the Soma with whom they sometimes go, and who in their life excited them to their great deeds. 

The god who is most closely united with Soma is Indra, who needs the drink to strengthen him to perform the slaying of Vṛtra: hence the drink is called the bolt, and Soma even takes the title of Vṛtra-slayer. Again Indra makes the sun to rise when he has drunk Soma, so that Soma is credited with this feat also. From this it is a short step to becoming a great cosmic power, who generates the two worlds and wields universal sway. He rides in a chariot with Indra, and is connected with the Maruts. He becomes a great and terrible warrior with a bow and shaft: he (alone of Vedic gods 3) is described as killing the wicked and he also kills the demons. The Yajurveda * says that Brahmans who drink the Soma can slay their foes by their mere look. Through

The God Soma

Indra he is associated with Vayu, and, more superficially, he is connected with Puṣan and Rudra. 

The dualism in the character of Soma appears in the two quite different accounts of his birth, in heaven and on the mountains. The mountain birth of Soma is made more precise by the epithet Maujavata, which seems to point to mount Muñjavant, and the Avesta declares that Haoma grows in the mountains. But it is by no means certain that the rock, from which the eagle brought Soma, is to be so taken; it seems rather to refer to the clouds and to point to his celestial form. Of the celestial abode of Soma there is abundant evidence of all kinds : he is the bird in the heaven, his home is in the highest heaven, but the contact with the terrestrial is clear in the fact that Soma going over the filter is also Soma on the summit (sānu) of the sky. 

2 

The bringing of Soma from the mountains was no doubt a physical act, performed regularly by the priests or on their behalf: the ritual shows that the tradition of using Soma was kept up, when the priests had long left the place where the Soma grew, and when it had to be brought from afar off. The sacred character of the plant, however, vindicated itself in a curious manner. It had come to be necessary to purchase the drink, or rather the plants whence the juice could be extracted, but the ritual shows the Soma seller 1 regarded as a disgraceful creature from whom is taken away, with blows, the price, a cow, paid to him for the stalks. On the celestial side there stands the Rigvedic myth of the descent of Soma which is brought down by an eagle to the earth. The myth is told at some length in two hymns of the Rigveda * and referred to in others. The eagle was restrained by a hundred iron castles, but it none the less secured the Soma and fled with it from the sky: the archer Kṛśānu, however, who saw the bird as it fled away shot at it and severed one feather : the Brāhmaṇas3 add that the feather or claw or the leaf of the shoot became a tree, the Parṇa or Palaśa, or a porcupine. The eagle is in the legend repre- sented as bringing down the Soma for Indra, and Indra is once directly called an eagle, when seated at the Soma offering, but not in immediate connexion with the myth. On the other hand Agni is called the eagle of heaven once and often a bird; the term eagle is applied in a Brāhmaṇa® to Agni as lightning, and from these data Bloomfield' derives the conclusion that the whole origin of the myth of the descent of Soma is the lightning flash, which comes forth from the cloud, the castle of iron, and which brings down to the earth the refreshing rain. With this accords the fact that in one passage of the Rigveda ® the descents of the lightning and of Soma are combined. It is not, it should how- ever be noted, of much importance whether the eagle be treated as Agni or as Indra, since an essential feature of Indra is the lightning which breaks

forth while the rain falls, and it is probable that, when he is hailed as an eagle at the Soma sacrifice, he is regarded as the bringer of the Soma. 

1 

Soma is a plant, and the most lordly of all the plants, and therefore he is king of the plants: he is also the king of the gods, of the whole earth and of men, but the Yajurveda 1 shows that the Brahmans had asserted that he was the only king of the Brahmans: at the royal consecration the other men might recognize the king, but to the Brahmans he was not announced as their king, who was Soma alone. Doubtless at this most sacred and trying moment of their inauguration kings had to accept theoretical claims of immunity from their control, which they knew how to value at their true worth for practical affairs. 

The connexion of Soma with the plants was, however, of high importance for his future as a god: the connexion of the moon with plant life seems to have been often noted by early peoples, and was very probably recognized by the Aryans in India; moreover the growth of the moon and its decline was significant of the same progress as the swelling up of the Soma shoots: the fiery clear drops of the Soma, as it fell from the plant, were likened to the rays of the moon reflected upon the water: the Soma had come to be held to be a bright deity. Hence it may be there rose the idea that the Soma was really at the same time the moon: it is asserted in the Chandogya Upanisada in so many words that the Soma is the moon and is the food of the gods and is drunk by them. The Brahmaņas regularly identify Soma and the moon; thus the Nakṣatras are said to have been the wives of king Soma, who, how- ever, preferred to stay with Rohiņi only, wherefore the other ladies went to their father, and, as a result, disease seized the king, who was fain to agree to live loyally with all his wives each in turn. The phases of the moon are explained by the fact that the gods and the Fathers eat the substance of the Soma which is ambrosia. In the Atharvaveda • we find that Soma is several times certainly the moon. In the Rigveda itself by far the most certain case is the wedding hymn," which is, however, by its confused character not an early hymn. There Soma is the husband of Surya, who is far more often connected with the Aśvins, or occasionally with Puṣan, and both these two gods and Puṣan also are introduced into the hymn, as if in recognition of their claim to have share in the wedding. Here Soma is said to be in the lap of the stars, and a distinction is drawn between the Soma which the priests know and that which they crush. That the identification was priestly and late is here asserted as clearly as anything of the sort can be expected to be asserted. It is possible that there are some other references to the moon character of the Soma in the Rigveda, as when it is spoken of as a drop going to the ocean, looking with the eye of a vulture, but the effort of deciding what are these passages is quite out of all proportion to the value of the results

which can be obtained. In the chaos of the ideas of the ninth book of the Rigveda there are passages which may be referred to Soma as the moon, or at least to comparison of Soma and the moon, but it is a very significant fact that the commentators on the Rigveda, despite their familiarity with the moon theory of Soma, never identify the Soma there with the moon. 

2 

In opposition to this theory Hillebrandt 1 insists that the moon nature of Soma exists throughout: that the deity is the moon sans phrase, but that in the moon there is an ambrosia which is eaten by the gods in heaven and in the form of the Soma plant is eaten by the men on earth, who in eating it thus, like the gods, partake of the substance of the moon. This god, he argues, was the greatest and most popular of all Vedic gods, and ranked even above Indra and far above the sun gods. He therefore treats, among others, Bṛhaspati as a moon god. The most serious objection to this view is the fact that, while in the later literature * the nature of Soma as the moon is apparent on every hand, in the Rigveda it can only be restored by conjecture, and there is a definite assertion in one hymn that the conception of Soma as the moon is mythic and known to the Brahmans only. Again, in the vast majority of passages, it is perfectly plain that the Soma plant and its qualities are referred to. If we could show ab extra that the plant is also the moon, this would not be a fatal objection to the theory of Hillebrandt, but, as this cannot be done, and as the ordinary view that the plant is deified and made into a great god is adequate to account for the facts, it is an offence against sound principles of method to adopt any other theory. 

3 

That the Soma cult goes back to the Avesta 3 is notorious: it is there said to grow on a mountain watered by the rains of heaven: as Varuna is said to place it on rock, so a god places it on Mount Haraiti: it is brought by an eagle in the Rigveda from the sky: in the Avesta it is taken from its mountain by skilled birds. It is in both India and Iran the king of plants, it gives long life and removes death: it grows in the waters. It was pressed twice a day according to the Avesta: its yellow juice was mixed with milk. But the plant had also a celestial character, and that character distinguished it from the mere terrestrial plant. It is brought down from heaven and is a mighty king. Even the epithet 'slayer of Verethra' has been found applied to the Haoma. Beside minor similarities, which attach to any divine natures, there are found the most striking similarities in the legend of the preparers of the Soma: they are in the Avesta Vivanhvant, Athwya, and Thrita, while those of the Rigveda are Vivasvant and Trita Aptya. 

Soma is derived from the root su, and means merely the pressed drink, and there is no parallel word in the other Indo-European languages, so that it must be recognized that the Soma cult was a special Indo-Iranian innovation, 1 Ved.

presumably produced by the discovery of some plant which when pressed produced a juice pleasant to drink or at least intoxicating. It is also most probable that the plant grew only in some area which was far from the homes of the Vedic Indians: substitutes came freely to be used for it, and all efforts to decide precisely what the plant was have failed to achieve more than probable results.1 But the word madhu, ‘honey,' is cognate with the Greek methu and the Anglo-Saxon medu, and the parallelism of the legends of the eagle and Soma, the nectar-bringing eagle of Zeus, and the eagle, which fetched the mead and which was really Odin, is obvious and undeniable. The question, therefore, arises what was the mead which is thus conceived to have been brought down, and it seems difficult to deny that it was originally simply the water of the rain or the dew. This is certainly the natural way of inter- preting the myth of Soma and the eagle, and the change made in the concep- tion in the Indo-Iranian period would be merely that this rain would have been identified with the Soma drink, thus transforming the old myth into some- thing very important and real. If, as has been suggested, the old myth made the home of the mead in the moon," the identification of Soma and the moon would be at once explained, but this is not at all clearly made out. 

Oldenberg, however, does not accept the view that the legend of the descent of Soma can be explained in this simple and satisfactory way, and he does not, therefore, adopt the same view as is here taken of the process by which the Soma came to be sacred. He would seem to hold that the rise of the Soma cult was independent at first of the older belief in the mead, and it is true that the Avesta does not actually apply the term mead to Haoma; it seems, however, much simpler to adopt the view that the mead was an Indo-European view, and that the identification of Soma with it, and, therefore the application to it of the Soma legend, were the immediate outcome of the discovery of the intoxicating drink. 

## 4. The Rivers 

It is perhaps doubtful whether the rivers can claim to be regarded as among the great gods of the Rigveda, but their importance in the mind of the Vedic Indians was perhaps sufficient to justify their treatment in this place. One whole long hymn 3 is accorded to the Sarasvati, and in two verses of it are enumerated her tributaries and other affluents, while the Vipãś and Çutudri claim another hymn 4 of some poetical beauty.

is the Sarasvati, which has in all three hymns devoted to it: she flows from the mountains, tearing them down; she has seven sisters and is mother of streams: she is daughter of the lightning (päviravi) and has a spouse, who later is called Sarasvant. She is divine, she comes with the Fathers to the sacrifice, and is stated to be descended from the sky, an early anticipation of the com- mon Indian belief of the divine birth of the Ganges. She has other and more intimate connexions with human life: she bestows progeny, wealth, and im- mortality, she gave Vadhryaśva a son; she is terrible and a Vṛtra-slayer, but to her worshippers a protector. 

Sarasvati is connected with Indra and with Puṣan, but in the main with the Aśvins: she takes part in the rite by which they heal Indra, and she is spoken of in the Yajurveda 1 as the wife of the Aśvins. She forms also one of the triad of goddesses Bhārati, Iḍā, and Sarasvati, or Mahi, Hotrā, and Sarasvati, who are invoked in the Apri hymns of the animal sacrifice: Iḍā is a mere abstraction of the idea of the sacrificial offering, and Mahï and Hotră are clearly deities of the same kind: Bharati, however, must refer to the lady of the Bharatas, and the identification is of first-rate importance as it enables us to decide which Sarasvati is meant in these cases. The Bharatas, we know, dwelt on the Sarasvati and the Dṛṣadvatī, and sacrifices on the Sarasvati are prescribed in the Brahmanas and the Sūtras: the combination of the god- desses must have grown up when Sarasvati meant the stream which is connected with the Drṣadvati. Nor is it at all improbable that the same river is meant in every or nearly every case: the older view 3 that Sarasvati meant the Indus, or the view that in any case it refers still as originally to the Harahvaiti cannot be supported by any conclusive proof it is true that the present river Sarasvati is small, and loses itself in the sand, but it may well have been more important than this in the time of the Rigveda, and in any case there is no doubt of its holiness in the Brāhmaṇa period, a fact which really disposes of the argument against it, based on its size. 

In the Rigveda in Sarasvati we need not see anything more than a river goddess somewhat strongly anthropomorphized in certain details who inspires prayers of devotion. But in the Brāhmaṇas she is connected with speech, perhaps because Vedic culture and poetry flourished specially there, and in the post-Vedic literature she is the goddess of eloquence and the wife of Brahman. The nearest approach to this is the statement of the Yajurveda " that, when Indra was ill, Sarasvati by speech communicated vigour to him, where speech

is merely her instrument, not her nature, and her healing power must rather be deemed to be due to her nature as the purifying water. 

Beside Sarasvati in one hymn 1 we have an invocation of Sarasvant to give offspring, protection, and plenty: his fertilizing waters and breast are referred to. Agni as Sarasvant once appears as a giver of rain. It is hardly necessary to see in him more than a male counterpart of Sarasvati: there is nothing to support the more important character of guardian of the celestial waters which is accorded to him by Roth or the identification with Apāṁ Napat proposed by Hillebrandt and Hardy."

Other streams are addressed as great, such as Sarayu and Sindhu, and the conception of seven streams is particularly often found, doubtless because of the Vedic predilection for the number seven. It is probably needless to press the number for an exact identification, especially as it is quite probable the idea came with the Indians from Iran.*

## 5. The Earth 

The goddess Pṛthivi plays a singularly restricted part in the Rigveda except in so far as she is invoked along with Dyaus. She has but one short hymn of her own, and a long and interesting hymn ascribed to her in the Atharvaveda is conspicuous rather for its accuracy of enumeration of the sights of the earth than for religious fervour. She is rich in heights, bears the burden of the mountains, and supports in the ground the forest trees. She is great, shining, and firm, and quickens the earth, by scattering rain from the cloud, a fact which shows that she is not rigidly confined to her element, doubtless because she has borrowed an attribute of Dyaus himself. The Brahmanas" follow the Rigveda in referring her name as broad to the fact of her having been extended. In the funeral hymn she is appealed to be tender to the dead as to a child, and she is called kindly mother earth. In the domestic ritual offerings to her as Bhümi are not rare.” 

## 6. The Sea

All the available evidence points to the fact that the Vedic Indians had little accurate knowledge of the sea, and that none of the tribes were actually settled by the banks of the ocean, but at the same time the legend of the Aśvins and their ships and of the saving of Bhujyu must be allowed, when taken in connexion with a few passages where the sea seems clearly a real sea,

and not the sea of the sky, to prove that the Indians had heard of the sea, and knew by hearsay, if not by experience, of undertakings directed towards obtaining wealth by sea commerce. But the conception of the sea as a deity, Samudra, is most rudimentary, whether we are to apply it to the ocean proper or merely to the lower course of the Indus, where it assumes a breadth which prevents the other bank being seen.1 He is invoked with Aja Ekapād, Ahi Budhnya, and Pṛthivi, and occurs once or twice in other enumerations, once with Sindhu: a personification of Arnava, who in one case occurs beside him, is still more feeble. The ritual agrees with the Rigveda: occasionally offerings are made as at the horse sacrifice to the god,” and even in the Gṛhya ritual 3 he is not unknown, as, for instance, at the Baliharana he is given an offering along with beings like Dhanvantari and Oṣadhi, the plant', but in the main these offerings occur in enumerations of many deities, and emphasize the unreal character of the god. The same rule applies in the later literature : the ocean is often poetically described, but a real god of the ocean seems not to have been created in India except under Mahommedan influences. In the Rigveda there is no hint that the realm of Varuņa lies in any special con- nexion with the ocean, and it is not until the Brāhmaṇas begin their specula- tions that the identity of the ocean and Varuna is asserted, but still at a time when Varuņa is lord of all waters, and not those of the ocean merely. The same point is made clear by the ritual, for the only specifically sea offering which is made to Varuņa is that of a nakra,3 which may have been a crocodile, and which is given in the lists of victims at the Aśvamedha, and it must be remembered that the aim of the compilers of the lists of victims was evidently not to trouble regarding real offerings, but to multiply as much as possible the number of victims to be offered, in theory not in fact.
