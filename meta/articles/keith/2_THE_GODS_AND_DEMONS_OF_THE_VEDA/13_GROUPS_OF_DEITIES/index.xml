      <description>THE type of the dual deities, who form quite a marked feature of the Rigveda in which some sixty hymns are addressed to such gods, is given by the pair Dyāvāpṛthivi, heaven and earth, the primeval parents.

Other names are Dyāvākṣāmā, Dyāvābhūmi or Rodasi, in which the male character of Dyaus, never perfectly established, has yielded to the prevailing femininity of Pṛthivi.</description>

      <description>It is a characteristic trait of the Rigveda that some forty hymns are devoted to the group of gods called All-gods, Viśve Devās, and the impression given by the Rigveda is borne out by the ritual in which the All-gods receive frequent attention.2 The fact must be carefully borne in mind in framing any theory as to the feeling of the poets as to the rank of the several gods: they must have known of these joint invocations, in which as many gods as possible are propitiated, and the same tendency to be catholic in the reverence</description>
