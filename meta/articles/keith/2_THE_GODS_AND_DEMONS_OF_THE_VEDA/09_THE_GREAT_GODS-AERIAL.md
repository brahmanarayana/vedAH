## 01. Indra 

INDRA is the greatest god of the Rigveda, with the solitary exception of Varuna, who may be deemed to equal him in might.1 His connexion with the Soma offering is, however, far closer than that of Varuņa; he is the subject of 250 hymns, or almost a quarter of the whole of the collection, and he shares with other deities at least fifty more. He is, however, like Varuņa in one thing he is not a god whose physical nature overwhelms the anthropo- morphism of the poets: he has, therefore, become the subject of many myths, which it would be idle to seek to bring into any connexion whatever with the normal basis of his nature. 

Of the personal appearance of Indra a much more vivid picture is given than of any other of the gods: he has head, arms, hands, and a great belly which he fills full with the Soma, so that it comes to be likened to a lake. His lips are often mentioned: his beard is agitated when he moves, and, like his hair, it is tawny; his arms are long and strong, as becomes the wielder of the bolt, and he can assume any form at will. His favourite weapon is the thunderbolt,2 of metal or of gold, with four or a hundred angles, with a hundred or a thousand points. His is par excellence the epithet vajrin, 'bearer of the bolt', which is else given but once each to Rudra, the Maruts, and Manyu. When he bears a bow, his arrows are hundred-pointed and winged with a thousand feathers. He has also a hook with which he gives wealth or fights, and the Atharvaveda 3 gives him a net wherewith to over- come his foes. His chariot is drawn by horses, normally two, but sometimes a thousand or eleven hundred: their hair is like peacock's feathers. His favourite food is the Soma, which he drinks on the very day of his birth, and of which he consumed three lakes when seeking to slay Vṛtra: on yet another occasion he drank thirty lakes. The epithet Soma-drinker is so essentially his that it is given only to Vayu apart from him, and a few times to Bṛhaspati and Agni, when associated with him. His connexion with Vāyu in this regard is close he is said to have Indra for his charioteer. Indra, however, also drinks milk mixed with honey, and is partial to buffaloes, eating as many as

The birth of Indra is mysterious, like that of other heroes; he declines to be born save through his mother's side: this may be interpreted as the lightning bursting through the cloud, or it may be merely treated as one of the many cases of miraculous births, which may be ascribed to nothing more than popular fancy, and of which the birth of Athene is on one view a famous case. His mother is called once a cow, and he is styled a calf: once she is called Niṣtigri, identified by Sāyaṇa with Aditi. Twice she is styled Çavasī, as he is the son of strength (śavas). The Atharvaveda makes her Ekāṣṭakā, daughter of Prajapati; which is of course merely speculation. His father is Tvaṣtṛ or Dyaus, and a legend clearly indicates that, in order to obtain the Soma, he seized his father by the foot and slew him: perhaps for this reason we find one clear record of the hostility of the gods to Indra. Only late speculation makes him the oldest, or the favourite, son of Prajapati, while with Agni he springs from the mouth of the giant in the Puruṣasūkta. Agni and Pûṣan are made his brothers, and his sons once occur, but without indication who they are; he has, however, a son Kutsa, produced from his thigh and precisely like him, in the Jaiminiya. His wife is Indrāṇī, but the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa gives him two wives, Senā and Prāsahā, who are clearly legendary; the regular post-Vedic wife, Çaci, daughter of Puloman, is clearly derived from his epithet śacipati, ‘lord of strength', understood as husband of Çaci, a meaning which Pischel * vainly reads into the Rigveda. She definitely appears in the Jaiminiya Brāhmaṇa in a curious legend in which Kutsa Aurava, born of Indra's thigh and his double, lies with her and is marked by Indra to distin- guish him. But another tale alluded to in the Atharvaveda 10 tells how in love of an Asura woman, the Dänavi Vilisteñgā," he went to live among the Asuras, assuming a female form among women, a male among men. Here perhaps should be reckoned his invocation as Menā,' wife' or ' daughter' of Vṛṣaṇaśva in the Subrahmaṇya.12 A vulgar tale 18 records how, as Sumitra, he had

intercourse with Dirghajihvi, an Asura woman, who licked the Soma and had unlimited organs of sex. 

Of the other gods Indra is closely connected with his troop, the Maruts, with Agni whom he generates or finds in the waters, and to whom he is akin in nature, (with Varuna, Vayu, Soma, Bṛhaspati, Puṣan, and Visņu, whose relation to him becomes in some passages a close one. With Surya he is actually here and there identified, he receives the epithet Savitṛ, and the Çatapatha Brāhmaṇa1 declares him to be the sun and Vṛtra the moon. But he differs from all the gods in his physical magnitude which makes the two worlds but half of him, heaven and earth insufficient for his girdle, and ten earths not equal to him. (No language is too strong for the Vedic poets in expressing his greatness: Sürya and Varuņa are made inferior to him, he is invoked to destroy the foes of Varuna, Mitra, Aryaman, he makes broad space for the gods in battle he is an independent ruler par excellence, and occasionally, like Varuņa, a universal ruler. He is the mighty (śakra), an epithet rarely used of any other god. He practically alone is styled of a hundred powers' (śatakratu); he is strong, young, immortal, and ancient) 

: 

There is nothing here to show clearly the nature of Indra, save in so far as his connexion with the sun and the fire suggests his fiery character, and that with Vayu his fierce onset. But the myth of the slaying of Vṛtra, which is the great deed of the god, is not doubtful in sense. It takes the form of the slaying by the god with the aid of the Maruts and of Visņu, or without their aid, of a serpent which was lying on the mountains keeping in with its coils the waters of the streams. The flood of the waters flows then swiftly to the sea, and at the same time the light shines forth. The god strikes Vṛtra on the back, or smites his face, or pierces his vital parts. But the action is not done once, but ever and again, and Indra is implored to perform it in the future as in the past. The waters set free are likened often to lowing cows, and such is the fury of the onset that the heaven and earth tremble with fear. It is important to note that the terms used of the myth are essentially restricted with very rare exceptions to the words, bolt, mountain, waters, or rivers, in place of lightning, clouds, and air. The cows which occur here and there are open to two interpretations; they may be simply the waters, for in a few cases the waters are clearly so designated, as when it is said that the cows roared at the birth of Indra. But they may also be the rays of light, set free when the waters are loosened. 

2 

In the view of Oldenberg the use of the terms mountain and streams is proof that in the Vedic period the poets conceived the deed of Indra as the setting forth from mountains on earth of streams terrestrial, the invaluable 

a yoke on his shoulders, supporting a basket of cakes and a pot of curds and butter, to Upamă, wife of Kṣatra, a presage of victory in battle; JB. iii. 244 IT.

waters of the Punjab: he grants that in the oldest period the myth was one of the thunderstorm, the fall of rain, and the coming of the light.1 But, while he admits that this view of the myth was perfectly well known to Yaska and to the later literature, he denies that it was appreciated by the Vedic poets. This is, however, difficult to accept: the arguments adduced for it are not by any means conclusive. The absence of direct mention normally-occasionally there is such mention as Oldenberg admits-is due to the fact that the story is a myth; it has passed the stage when it is merely a description of phenomenon, and it is not only a myth but a very popular myth. Moreover, it is impossible to accept the view that Vajra, the name of the bolt, is not the thunderbolt, which it is throughout the Vedic literature, often in quite clear fashion. The comparison of mountains with clouds is natural and easy: the mountains are the clouds, which before the storm hang in heavy darkness refusing to yield the rain: the storm comes, the lightning bursts forth, the rain falls, and the sun shines out. A different view is suggeste 1 by the theory of Hillebrandt which sees in the story of the contest with Vṛtra, not the storm-god bringing down the rain to earth, but the defeating of a serpent demon, the glacier which with the winter cold holds fast the waters in ice. The suggestion is brilliant and attractive, and, if such a glacial myth existed, it would clearly be natural to find its remnants in the tale of Vṛtra, but the evidence which can be adduced from the language of the Rigveda is of the most inadequate nature to prove the thesis desired. 

The slaying of Vṛtra is not merely attributed to Indra: by the syncretism of the Veda, it is also attributed to Agni and Soma. The gods as a whole are supposed to aid Indra in the contest, but at the roaring or hissing of the serpent they fled, leaving the Maruts only to aid him, and once at least even they fled, and left him alone. Viṣṇu is also an aider in the struggle and even earthly priests lend aid. 

Another myth tells of the slaying of the three-headed Viśvarupa by Indra: 4 it is, however, clear that this is a more modern form of a myth in which Viśvarupa was slain by Trita, for this form of the myth appears in the Rigveda, and in the Avesta Thraëtaona is said to slay a three-headed serpent with six eyes, freeing thus two fair ladies. In the classical myths of Herakles and Geryoneus, and of Hercules and Cacus, the monsters have likewise three heads, and, when slain, the hero wins the cattle which they have taken and

hidden away. The motive of winning cows is found also in the Viśvarūpa myth, and it is perfectly clear that these four myths are one and the same in nature: in the case of the Avesta the part of restoring lost cattle has past over to Ahura himself, who is par excellence the discoverer of lost things. 

With this myth may be compared the legend 1 of Saramā and the Paņis. The Panis stole and hid away cows in a cave among the rocks, and Indra's dog, Saramā, pursues them and finds the place where are the cows: them she demands back from the Panis in a dialogue which is preserved to us in an interesting, if not very old, hymn of the Rigveda. The Panis refuse to give them back and the later tradition makes Saramă unfaithful to her mission. This, however, is not recorded in the Rigveda, and from other accounts it seems that Indra advances against the Panis and recovers the cows. More- over, we find Bṛhaspati engaged in the same feat: the priestly god with his prayers cleaves the barriers behind which the cows are hidden, and brings them forth. Agni too takes a share in the struggle: the priestly god of fire is naturally active in this important undertaking. The Añgirases also take a great part, or, in their place, the seven seers, the eponymous fathers of the priestly clans. They pray and they offer sacrifice, and thus attain the same end. A further element in the picture of Vala: Indra cleaves his ridge in attaining the cows. The meaning of the myth can hardly be doubtful when it is noted how often Indra is brought into prominence as the maker of the dawn and the finder of the sun. The cows must be, not rain-clouds, as some- times in the myth of Vṛtra, but the morning beams of light, or perhaps the red clouds of dawn; there is little difference between the two conceptions. The nature of Vala,' the Keeper', is clearer still: he is merely the personifica- tion of the place in which the cows are kept. But the Papis are not quite so easy to explain: Hillebrandt2 has found in them an historical people, and has argued that the mention of the Panis is a piece of history turned into myth. It is perfectly possible that this could be the case, but in the case of the Panis, who are assimilated to Parnians, the references are not satisfactorily taken as historical in ultimate essence: the theory too involves speculations regarding the places in which the Rigveda was composed which will not stand very close investigation. The natural and satisfactory view is that the Panis were the misers, who refuse to give the priests gifts, and who are overthrown, a con- ception which is interwoven with the mythical winning of the clouds. 

A further question, however, arises as to the exact circumstances in which 

1 RV. x. 108. Oldenberg (Rel. des Veda', 

p. 147) treats the legend as an aetio- logical myth to explain men's owner- ship of cows. A similar view of the waters myth is also unlikely. Rhys (Celtic Heathendom, pp. 299 ff.) holds him a culture hero, but admits con- tamination with Trita or Dyaus.

in Saramā, and sun and moon in the Sārameyas, and SO with Saranyü (ii. 48-50). 

* Macdonell and Keith, Vedic Index, i. 471-8. Meyer (Gesch. des Alt, I. ii, p. 905) also rejects Hillebrandt's view, which is repeated in Ved. Myth., pp. 95 f. See Oldenberg on RV. vi. 61.1; GGA. 1914, p. 447.

the clouds are won. Is it to be supposed that the legend is only another side of the winning of the light in the Vṛtra legend, which means, no doubt, the appearance of light after the thunderstorm? The answer to this question is usually given in the affirmative, but it seems much more likely that the myth is an independent one, the winning of the sun and the dawn from the dark mountains of the night, as is the view of Oldenberg. To suppose that this is a secondary development from the other myth is not necessary, nor very probable. But it is impossible to follow Oldenberg in the view that the winning of the light and the sun, which is connected with the Vṛtra myth, is not an expression of the recovery of the light after the storm, but a poetical embellishment of the theme. 

While it is in these mythical forms that the feats of Indra as bringing down the rain and finding the light are mainly celebrated, there are passages in which he is credited with creating the lightnings and turning the waters of heaven downwards, and very much more f  ́eely is his feat of winning the dawn and the sun celebrated. Such a god was clearly essentially suited to be the god of the warrior, and Indra is the great aider of the Vedic Indian, the Aryan, in his fights, whether with other Aryan foes, or more often in the tradition with the Dāsas or Dasyus, in whom we must often see the aborigines. It would be wholly impossible to believe that in every case the Dāsas are human enemies, and they include doubtless evil spirits who are none other than the gods of the hated races: twice in the Rigveda 1 we find phallus wor- shippers regarded as hostile, and everything points to the probability of such deities being among the enemies overthrown by Indra in the Rigveda. But, equally obviously, historical men may be reckoned as among the foes of the gods, and invested with traits of demons. Or again they may simply be men- tioned as defeated by Indra, as princes whom we have no reason to doubt as Aryan are represented as being defeated for another prince by the aid of the god, as when for Tūrvayāṇa, Ayu, Atithigva, and Kutsa are overthrown. 

The hostile Dāsas or Dasyus are regarded as black skinned 2 and noseless, doubtless a reference to flat noses, but their chief characteristic, and the one which makes them no real men, is their refusal to worship the Aryan gods, and to give gifts to the priest, the two essential duties of the true Vedic warrior. Of the princes favoured by Indra the greatest, or one of the greatest, is Atithigva or Divodāsa, ' the servant of the heaven', whose name has wrongly induced Hillebrandt to treat him as a Dăsa and to find the Däsas among the Dahae, instead of among the aborigines of India itself. Among his foes are men with names like Karañja and Parnaya, whose appellations seem very possibly aboriginal, and above all Çambara. That foe has forts, ninety or ninety-nine,

or a hundred, and with the aid of Indra he destroys them and defeats him in his home in the mountains. Mythical these references may of course be, and clouds be meant, but it is quite as easy to see in them the real palisades of the aborigines stormed by Aryan princes, and their pursuing their enemy to the hills in which as always the defeated forces from the plains take refuge. Çambara is also defeated by Indra for the sake of Ṛjiśvan, son of Vidathin. He also lulls to slumber and to ruin Cumuri and Dhuni for the sake of Dabhiti, and this reference may not inaptly be applied to an attack on the enemy made by night when the camp was wrapped in slumber.1 Another foe overcome by Indra is Ilibiśa: his name like that of Pipru and of other of Indra's foes seems un-Aryan. 

4 

In other cases there may be a more mythic basis. The demon Urana is described as having ninety-nine arms which is rather inhuman: 2 Arbuda is so little specified as to be of doubtful origin. Çuṣņa seems from his name to be the hisser,3 in which case he would have analogies with Vṛtra, whose snorting (śvasatha) so frightens the gods that they run away, leaving Indra to fight alone with the monster. He is also called a wild beast and he seems to be horned, which may of course merely refer to the head-dress of a chief of the aborigines. His chief rival is Kutsa, who appears as battling against him, and as victor by the aid of Indra, who for his sake tore from the sun a wheel, pro- longing the daylight and thus enabling, it may be assumed, Kutsa to turn the issue of battle. The feat of Indra is several times mentioned, and the fact that Kutsa is a real hero is suggested, though not proved, by the fact that elsewhere he appears in hostile relation to Indra, just as Atithigva, who is normally the protégé of Indra, in one or two places appears in the reverse relation. It is true that it is not to be expected that a god, or a hero of divine dimensions, would be thus placed in opposition to the god, though, as the god is the uncertain Indra, the argument is by no means conclusive. Kutsa in the case of his real personality must be a king, and this is not inconsistent with his being called a seer royal seers are not unknown. The Jaiminiya Brāhmaṇa makes him born from Indra's thigh and disloyal to him. No other god has anything like the same place as Indra in the overcoming of the Dasas for the sake of the Aryans: the feat is ascribed elsewhere only to Agni, the Aśvins, and the gods generally.

seems, made a compact with him not to slay him by any weapon, by wet or dry, by day or night, and, true to this compact, when he did slay him it was with the foam of the sea at the twilight on the margin of the sea, and the head, struck off, follows him, reproaching him with treachery. The story is especially interesting because of its clear reference to the idea of the external soul: doubtless that of Namuci was deemed to be placed in the sea foam. Note- worthy also is Indra's consciousness of guilt in slaying.1 A further curious tale tells how Indra as the result of over-indulgence in his favourite Soma became ill, and how he was cured by drinking with Namuci, or by extracting in some way from his body, a curious mixture of Soma and Sură. The Sautrā- maņi rite of the Brāhmaṇas is clearly a case of a rite founded on the strange and unedifying myth. In the Rigveda Indra twists off the head of Namuci, which suggests the natural phenomenon of a waterspout amidst a storm. 

The Asuras also are more probably to be taken as the powers of darkness than as men, though individual Asuras may be quite well nothing but men : thus Pipru is called a Dăsa, and also an Asura, and the Asura Varcin, whose hundred and thousand men are slain by Indra and Viṣṇu when they over- throw Çambara, may fall in the same category. As we have seen, the Asuras appear but seldom as foes in the Rigveda; in one hymn, however, we learn that Agni abandons the Asuras, and joins the gods, that Indra slays Vṛtra, and that the wiles of the Asuras depart from them. In the Brāhmaṇa literature Indra of course, like the other gods, fights against the Asuras, and after the usual period of defeat succeeds in defeating them in turn by the adoption of some ritual device or the repetition of some formula."

In some cases we have full evidence of historical happenings. Turvaśa and Yadu, that is the kings of the two tribes of that time, in whose historical character we have no ground to doubt," are declared to have been brought safely over the stream by Indra's aid, doubtless procured by the help of the priest, and he is the great god who assists Sudas at the instance of Vasiṣṭha * in the battle with the ten kings, and makes him overthrow his rivals, bringing them to death in the stream of the Paruṣṇī, and then assisting the king to overthrow Bheda. Similar is the statement that he aided Suśravas and slew 60,099 of his enemies, though the number is fabulous. It is he on whom men

The Gods and Demons of the Veda 

[Part II 

call in battle, and, little as the Vedic poetry is inspired with warlike spirit, here and there it is clear that the poet has caught some of the tone of war poetry.1 Doubtless part of the lavishing of wealth which is a merit of Indra's was manifested in the giving of victory in the strife for cows, which, as the chief form of property of primitive Indian society, made up the main object to be won in a mere foray. Indra too appears in close relations with his worshippers, as a friend, a brother, a father or father and mother in one. The epithet Kauśika denotes him as the family god of the Kuśikas. He is the generous god par excellence, whence the title Maghavan, bountiful, is almost exclusively his in the Vedic ritual literature, and is his common name in post-Vedic texts. His bounty includes wives and also children. 

In other cases myths are attached to Indra, in which we need not seek any direct connexion with his nature: as a great god he can stretch out heaven and earth, and in particular he settles the quaking mountains, while in the later Vedic texts he is said to have cut off the wings of the mountains and to have reduced them to a stationary condition. The wings then became the thunder clouds. The separation of heaven and earth is sometimes attributed to his victory over a demon, who held them together: the faint parallelism with the Hesiodic myth * is hardly worth note. If anything more than imagination is to be seen in the idea, it may be that the light appearing seems to separate the heaven and earth joined by the darkness. Probably, too, we must not see any reference to the myth of Vṛtra is the oft repeated wonder of the poet that Indra places in the red or raw cow the cooked milk. The problem seems to have been a favourite one in India. A less satisfactory side of his character is revealed in his addition to the drinking of Soma: a curious, if late, hymn 5 is represented as the monologue of the drunken Indra, who sees himself able to do anything he likes in the intoxication produced by his deep draughts. His over-indulgence in the drink has been noted, and it was his desire for it which drove him to slay his father. He is also the hero of more than one amour; an old litany, the Subrahmaṇyā, addresses him as the lover of Ahalya, a Brahman, calling himself Gautama, from which the Brahmaṇas derive the natural explanation that he approached Ahalya, wife of Gautama, under her husband's name and form. To Weber the episode denotes that the dawn of morning ascends the bright sky, but their loving commerce is broken by the cloud coming up, but it would be unwise to press the accuracy of such an explanation. It may be rather ranked with the many aetiological myths of

Indra

different countries in which a family claims divine descent through the inter- course of a god with an ancestress, whose honour is saved by the representa- tion that the god approached her in the guise of her lawful spouse. A still more obscure story 1 tells how a maiden, Apălă, found Soma beside a river, and having pressed it dedicated it to Indra, from whom she received the fulfilment of certain desires. Yet more obscure if possible is the famous Vṛṣākapi hymn, which narrates a dispute which arose between Indra and Indrāṇī over an ape, Vṛṣākapi, which was the dear friend of Indra, but which had aroused the anger of Indrāņi by destroying some of her property. Vṛṣākapi is in- duced, despite his caution, to be caught by Indrāṇī and is beaten by Indra, and banished from the house. Indra, however, misses his companion, and in some way not intelligible a reconciliation is effected. It would be idle to seek mythological conceptions in this strange confusion of ideas, and von Bradke 3 has ingeniously suggested that the hymn is none other than a satire on a con- temporary prince and his consort under th titles of the god and goddess. The problem is plainly insoluble. Another odd tale is that of his stealing Aiṣakṛta Çitibāhu's Soma in monkey form, this power of change of shape adhering to him in later tradition, where he appears as a leech, parrot, or cat. 

Nothing is more interesting in Indra's nature than the contrast between the strongly moral character of his rival Varuna and his own lack of moral quality. He is occasionally given moral attributes, and faith in him is enjoined, but the very fact that the existence of sceptics who denied his divinity is recorded shows that the nature of Indra was not in all quarters considered to be worthy of the conception of divinity, doubtless as compared with the figure of Varuņa. A list of his sins includes the killing of Viśva- rūpa, Vṛtra, the Arurmaghas, and the Yatis, and quarrelling with Bṛhaspati, to whom priestly partiality is shown.5 

6 

The existence of Indra in the period of Indo-Iranian unity, which was rendered probable by the existence of a demon Indra, and of the god of victory Verethraghna, who is clearly equivalent to Vṛtrahan, is made practically certain by the discovery of the name of Indra along with those of Mitra and Varuna and the Näsatya among the gods of the Mitanni. While the name is of quite uncertain origin,' the parallelism of the myth of the finding of the cows proves that part of the conception of the god is Indo-European.

(Part II 

## 02. Trita Āptya 

Trita Aptya is a deity, whose importance in the Rigveda is much less great than the account of the feats attributed to him would at first sight seem to warrant. He is not the subject of any hymn, and his name is mentioned no more than forty times in all. His associations are predominantly with Indra, but also with the Maruts, Agni, and Soma. The name Aptya belongs to him seven times in four hymns. 

The deeds of Trita have often the closest resemblance to those of Indra, and still more to those of Thrita in the Avesta. Thus, exhilarated by the Soma, he slays Vṛtra, he overthrows Vala, he destroys the three-headed Viśvarûpa, or again he assists Indra to overthrow Arbuda, while Indra is said to overthrow Viśvarūpa for him. He brings the Maruts on his car, and he sharpens Agni and makes his flames to rise. Agni also he finds. He has a secret and remote abode, whither the Adityas and the Dawn are besought to remove ill deeds and evil dreams. This home seems to be in the regions of the sun or the heaven. He is also a preparer of Soma, with powers of healing, and all wisdom centres in him. More characteristic is the legend that, being in a well, he prays to the gods for help: Bṛhaspati hears him and sets him free. Another version has it that, being in a pit, he prays to his father and goes forth claiming his father's weapons to fight with Viśvarupa. His shadowy figure becomes yet more obscure in the later Samhitas; the Yajurveda 1 ascribes to him the giving of long life, doubtless merely because he is the presser of Soma, and the Atharvaveda 2 knows him only as some far off deity to whom guilt or dreams may be banished. In the Brāhmaṇas we come across a tale of three brothers, Ekata, Dvita, and Trita, the first two of whom throw Trita in a well. Dvita actually occurs in the Rigveda, once with Trita and once in an Agni hymn apparently as identical with Agni. 

The Avestan parallel of Trita is Thrita, the third preparer of the Haoma, who received from Ahura 10,000 healing plants, which grew round the healing Haoma. Cognate with Thrita is Thraëtaona, son of Athwya, who slays the serpent of three heads and six eyes, Aži Dahaka; in his expedition for this purpose he is accompanied by two brothers who seek to slay him. The name Trita of course is third, while Aptya seems to refer to water and to be equivalent to Apām Napāt. 

The original nature of so obscure a god is not easy to decide. The connexion of Trita with Triton led Roth * to the view that he was a wind and water god : Hardy finds in him a moon god, for which view there is no evidence at all ;

Hillebrandt 1 holds that he is god of the bright sky revered in the Aptys family, or a deified ancestor, which is certainly inadequate as an account of his nature, and Pischel's * suggestion that he was originally a human healer, who was later deified, can hardly be taken seriously. Perry is unquestionably right in seeing in him an older god than Indra, who seems to have largely usurped his position as an important deity. His connexion with the Soma, which is peculiarly close and which shows him as more active in the details of its preparation than Indra, who is rather the drinker of Soma than the pre- parer of the plant, suggests the conclusion, which is also made plausible by his name as Third, that he is a form of fire, the lightning in which the Soma descends to earth. This would agree with his nature as watery, Aptya, and does not contradict any of his known features. But it is possible to hold that he was really a water deity, a parallel to the Greek Triton and the German Mimi.5 

§3. Apam Ne pāt 

The deity Apăṁ Napāt, ' child of the waters,' is more distinguished than Trita Aptya by being the subject of one whole hymn in the Rigveda, where his name occurs some thirty times in all. He is essentially connected with the waters, his relation being envisaged in diverse ways: three divine females desire to give him food, he sucks the milk of the first mothers, but he also engenders the embryo within them, as a bull. On the other hand he shines without fuel in the waters; clothed in the lightning he mounts upright the lap of the shining waters; around him the swift golden-coloured waters go. He is golden in form, he comes from a golden womb. His food is ghee, he has in his home a cow which gives him milk. He dwells in the highest place, and grows in secret, and in the hymn addressed to him he is directly identified with the god Agni, but elsewhere, though associated with Agni, he is distinguished from him. In the ritual he is connected with the waters; when the priests go for the waters required for the sacrifice, it is to Apāṁ Napăt that they address their prayer, and to him they offer butter in order to procure suitable waters; offerings are likewise made to him in the case when the sacrificial victim perishes in water, or when the Kārīrīṣți, a rain spell, is performed. 

In the Avesta there is found a spirit Apam Napāt, who lives in the depths of the waters, surrounded by females; he is said to have recovered the glory when in the flight between Atar and the dragon it fell in the ocean Vourukaša. In this trait there is clearly a connexion with fire, and the igneous nature of the spirit is asserted by Spiegel and Darmesteter,” the latter of whom considers

him to be the fire-god born from the cloud in the lightning. The natural con- clusion is that the traditional view is correct, and the Apăṁ Napāt is the same god as Agni, who is conceived as the lightning in the clouds. Of the moon character as connected with the waters which Hillebrandt 1 ascribes to this deity, a view accepted by Hardy, it is difficult to see any clear trace, and of resemblance to the sun as suggested by Max Müller 3 there is small evidence. Oldenberg's view that Agni and Apāṁ Napāt were originally distinct and that the identification, which he does not deny, is later, is of course possible, but it is not supported at all conclusively by the ritual, which naturally emphasizes the water side of the god, but which by no means proves that he was a water deity. The fact that the only hymn 5 addressed to him already identifies the deities precludes us from certain knowledge of an earlier period in the history of the deity. The other deities beside Agni with whom the god is found mentioned, such as Ahi Budhnya and Aja Ekapād, are probably also akin in part to Agni, and this is clear of Savitṛ, with whom the god seems to be identified once.® 

## 04. Ahi Budhnya 

Ahi Budhnya, 'the serpent of the deep', is closely associated in the few cases, twelve in all, in which his name is found in the Rigveda with the gods Aja Ekapād, Apāṁ Napät, the ocean, and Savitṛ. His name never occurs save in the hymns to the All-gods, and there it is regularly found among the spirits of the atmosphere, and in the Naighaṇṭuka ' he is definitely assigned to the middle or aerial region. The only definite traits ascribed to him are that he is born of the waters, sitting at the bottom of the streams in the spaces, language which the normal spirit of the Rigveda no less than the express assertion of Yāska & induces us to refer to the ocean of the air, and not to the earthly waters. His dangerous character is hinted at by the fact that he is implored not to give over his worshippers to evil. 

8 

The explanation of the nature of this spirit is by no means obvious. The serpent par excellence of the Vedic poets is Vṛtra, who encloses the waters, but also is described as lying upon them, or in the depth of the waters. Agni, however, is also described as a raging serpent and is said to have been produced in the depth (budhna) of the great space. To Hardy 10 the god is another form of the moon, to Oldenberg 11 a water snake, and Macdonell 12 suggests that he is really a form of Ahi-Vṛtra regarded as divine, and not as merely an enemy

of Indra. More vaguely it may be thought that the god is nothing more than a personification of the writhing cloud, whose serpentine form is a simple enough conception; the difference between this conception and that of Vṛtra would lie in the fact that the latter conception applies to the thunder clouds rather than to the mere clouds of the sky. The prayer for safety from harm would be natural enough addressed to a deity conceived in serpent form. It is, however, also possible that the god is merely another form of Agni; in the later Vedic texts the god is connected with Agni Gärhapatya,1 and with Aja Ekapad he receives a formal share in the offering at a Gṛhya ceremony, from which, however, it would doubtless be wrong to deduce that he was then a living deity. Such a deity he cannot have been for even the earliest period of the Rigveda, and the occasional mention of these gods even in the latest texts is testimony not to the life of the god but to the commanding influence of the Rigveda. In the post-Vedic literature the name survives as an epithet of Çiva and the name of a Rudra. 

$5. § 5. Aja Ekapād 

3 

Aja Ekapād, 'the one-footed goat', is mentioned five times with Ahi Budhnya, and but once alone. The deities with whom he is mentioned are the ocean, the stream, the aerial space, the thundering flood, and all the gods, and his aerial connexion seems clear despite the preference for the celestial region evinced by the Naighanțuka. In the later literature he appears as making firm the two worlds, according to the Atharvaveda, and as born in the east according to the Taittiriya Brāhmaṇa," and in the domestic ritual he is once joined with Ahi Budhnya. Native tradition, but only at a very late date, makes him out to be a form of Agni or the sun.® 

$ 

It is difficult from these scanty facts to make anything out as to the nature of the god Roth' taking Aja, not as 'goat' which is its proper sense, but literally as driver', saw in him the storm; Bergaigne, rendering Aja as unborn', thinks he is a mysterious deity of the isolated world; Hardy finds in him as usual the moon; Victor Henry 1o and Bloomfield 11 the sun, while Macdonell 12 suggests the interesting, and, so far as the evidence allows, satisfactory, hypothesis that the lightning form of Agni is meant, the goat denoting his swift coming, and the one foot the solitary streak which smites the earth. This view is clearly preferable to that of Oldenberg, 13 which sees in the figure the myth of a goat which holds apart the worlds, an idea which has no adequate support in the reference in the Atharvaveda.

The Gods and Demons of the Veda 

[Part II 

## 06. Matariśvan 

The god Mätariśvan, unlike the one-footed goat and the dragon of the deep, is not an ancient god: his name occurs but twenty-seven times in the whole of the Rigveda, and of these instances twenty-one are found in the latest parts of the Rigveda: he occurs five times in book iii, so that he seems to have been a favourite of the Viśvämitra family, and once in book vi. His connexion with Agni is of the closest: his name is thrice applied to Agni, and it is said of Agni1As germ of the heaven he is named Tanūnapät; when born he becometh Narăśansa; when in his mother he was fashioned as Mātariśvan, he became the wind's swift flight.' He is also identified with Bṛhaspati, and the poets who divide the one into many are said to call it Agni, Yama, Mätariśvan. On the other hand Agni appears as distinct from Mātariśvan : Agni appears to him and to Vivasvant, Mätariśvan brings Agni to Bhṛgu : he brings Agni from the sky, from afar for men, or from the gods. He is also said to produce him by friction and to set him up in human abodes. He is occasionally mentioned in connexion with Indra, and he serves as the messenger of Vivasvant between the heaven and the earth. In the wedding hymn he is asked with other deities to join the hearts of the husband and wife. 

The meaning of the word as he who grows in his mother' is clearly authentic: the root is śu, and the formation of the word is not open to serious exception; the accent, which is on the third syllable, is due to the analogy of such words as prātaritvan. The nature of the god can hardly be doubted in view of his relation to Agni: he must be the Agni who descends to earth in the form of lightning, and who like Agni himself grows in his mother. The only alternative view which has any plausibility is that of Oldenberg * who sees in him a Prometheus only, without any divine nature other than the bringing down of fire. This view is, however, open to the fatal objection that it is only reasonable to interpret the Prometheus legend in itself in the sense of the descent of fire; the god originally himself descends: it is later speculation which makes an independent personage the cause of his descent. 

Mātariśvan, however, in the Yajurveda and in the Brāhmaṇas is over- whelmingly the god of wind, not of fire, and this nature of his is already hinted at in the Rigveda where the epithets boundless and wandering are applied to him. In the view of Hillebrandt 5 the conception of the wind lies at the bottom of the nature of the Vedic god, and he points to the fact of the im- portant part played by the wind in the production of forest fires, and the striking character of dust storms in India in support of his thesis. He suggests, however, that there may have been a tendency in the Rigveda to identify the

wind and the fire which would account for the relation of Mätariśvan to Agni. To this theory the main objection is simple: it ignores the essential and not accidental connexion of Mätariśvan with Agni which is the most real part of his nature, and it is easy to point out that the transition from the fire god to a wind god is natural enough, and already hinted at in the Rigveda, where of Agni himself it is said that he is like the rushing wind. 

Like the serpent of the deep and the one-footed goat, Mâtariśvan is not a popular deity, and plays but little part in the cult. Mătali, Indra's charioteer in the post-Vedic literature, may be a faint reminiscence of his nature. 

## 07. Vayu and Vata 

The real wind gods of the Rigveda are Väyu and Vāta, who differ however quite distinctly in character and in importance. Vayu has one whole hymn1 addressed to him, and shares half a dozen with Indra, while Văta has only two short hymns in the tenth book. The former is the more anthropomor- phized of the two gods; hence he is joined with Indra, while Vāta is associated with Parjanya, who in comparison with Indra is an elemental deity. The close connexion of Indra and Vāyu is seen in the fact that Yāska 3 gives Vāyu, or Indra, as the second member of the triad of gods, into which the Nairuktas reduced the Vedic pantheon. 

3 

Vayu is beautiful, touching the sky, thousand-eyed; he travels on his impetuous course in a car with 99, 100, or 1,000 steeds yoked by his will. Indra rides with him in his car. He is said to have been generated by the two worlds for wealth, and to be the son-in-law of Tvastr, but the name of his wife is not given. He is also said to have generated the Maruts, and is once accompanied by them, but he has otherwise little connexion with them. In the Puruṣasūkta he is born of the giant's breath. Like his friend Indra, he is fond of the Soma, which he drinks in its pure form and which he protects. He is entitled to the first draught of the Soma as the swiftest of the gods: when the gods race, the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa makes him come first, then Indra second. Like the other gods he is asked to grant fame, children and riches, and to protect the weak, but these are quite secondary traits. 

4 

Vāta is merely the wind in its power, sweeping along great clouds of dust, shattering and thundering: his form cannot be seen by the mortal eye, though his roaring is heard, nor is the place of his birth known. He is the breath of the gods and the recipient of oblations. Stress is laid on his whiteness, and, as the wind heralds lightning and the appearance of the sun, Vāta is said to produce ruddy lights and to make the dawns to shine. His roaring is often alluded to,

and he is credited with healing power, doubtless from the purifying effect of his blasts. 

In the ritual the offerings especially of animal victims are made mainly to Vayu: Våta has a few offerings only made to him. The latter literature adds nothing of importance to the characterization of either god stress is laid on the power of the god, Vāyu, to diminish the heat of the sun, and in the Taittiriya Aranyaka 1 11 male and 11 female powers are given to him as attendants.* 

1 

The identification of the name Vāta with Wodan is open to the most grave objection on the score of form, nor is the parallelism in character of decisive importance.* 

## 08. Parjanya 

Parjanya, like Vata, is a god whose natural character is obvious and undeniable. He has three hymns in the Rigveda and his name occurs some thirty times, but in other passages it has beyond doubt the simple sense of rain cloud. More often, however, the rain cloud is made into a real person, often in theriomorphic shape: thus he is a bull who roars and impregnates the plants, and his roaring waters delight the earth. But, as the waters are normally conceived as feminine, he becomes in other cases a barren cow, or even a productive cow. He is the rain giver, and is besought to bestow rain, but in his actions he is subject to the control of Mitra and Varuna. He also thunders and smites trees and evildoers in anger, and, when he quickens the earth with his seed, the winds blow, and the lightning flashes. He is often associated with Vata, as Vayu with Indra. As a rain god plants spring up through him, and he is also credited with the increase of cattle, of mares, and of women. He is even exalted as an independent monarch, the ruler of all the world, in whom are established the three worlds and all beings. From another point of view he is essentially the father, and even the divine father. " 

In one place Dyaus is stated to be his father, and in his character, especially in the stress laid on his paternity, and his bull shape he is like to his father. His wife is the earth, though once she is called Vaśã. He has a son who may be Soma, for that god is called son of Parjanya,' but the lightning may also be meant. He is not rarely connected with Indra, rarely with Agni, and

occasionally with the Maruts. In an interesting hymn 1 the frogs are spoken of as raising their voices when aroused by Parjanya, though it is uncertain if the god or the cloud is meant. 

The nature of Parjanya as the thunder cloud is preserved throughout the Vedic literature and is recognized in the later period, where his name is also applied to Indra with whom in much he is identical, though his character has clear similarities also to that of Dyaus. The identification of him with the Lithuanian god Perkúnas, the Slav Perun, and the Norse Fjörgynn, which would make him to be in origin a god of the oak, or of the thunder which smites the oak, is open to the gravest difficulties of phonology, and must be considered as too doubtful to be worth more than serious consideration. No other attempt to explain his name is yet made plausible, though it has been attempted to show that he is a rain god pure and simple. 

## 09. The Waters 

Four hymns of the Rigveda and many verses praise the waters as goddesses,* but they have little personality and the element is nearly always plainly to be recognized. Their anthropomorphic form is the Apsaras, who will be treated below. They are mothers, or young wives: they flow in channels to the sea, but they are also celestial: they abide in the seat of the gods and of Mitra and Varuna: Varuņa moves in the midst of them, looking down on the good and base deeds of men. In them Agni dwells and they are his mothers. They cleanse and purify the worshipper, even from moral sins such as lying, cursing, and violence. They bestow long life and wealth and immortality.

The waters are also associated with honey: their waves are rich in honey, their milk is mixed with honey, and from tasting it Indra grows strong. For Soma they come with ghee, milk, and honey, and Soma takes them as his brides. 

In the Naighaṇṭuka the waters are reckoned as terrestrial only, but in some of these cases at any rate it is clear that the celestial waters are meant ; and that like all deities the waters are thought of as having a home in the heaven, even when also present on earth. The connexion with honey is of interest it confirms the view that the essential conception is that the waters in their refreshing drink are the honey as they also are the Soma: thus the

myth of the descent of Soma is no more than the tale of the descent to earth of the refreshing rain when the storm breaks forth.

With the growth of the ritual the distinction is made and developed between the various sources of the waters; thus standing water becomes unfit for use since it is Varuna's and Varuna would seize the sacrifice; in the Rajasūya, the consecration of the king, seventeen different kinds of water are used to confer each some special power on the king at the consecration: 1 the horse sacrifice sees also a similar use of the different powers of the waters to which under many aspects offerings are made. The purifying and protecting power of the waters is seen further in the domestic ritual, in which water is placed near a woman in child-bed.2

With the waters are connected not only gods like Agni, but various plants * and animals, of whom the most prominent are the snakes, the ants, and the frogs. The connexion with the water of the snakes appears to be a case of theriomorphism, as seen in the deity Ahi Budhnya, and in the snake form of Agni as well as in the case of the demon Vṛtra. The ants are evidently brought into connexion with water, because of their ability to find for them- selves water in apparently dry places as the Brāhmaṇa legends show, and the frogs are invoked to send water, because of their close connexion with the waters in which they move and have their being. The ritual emphasizes this connexion by the use of a frog in rites where cooling is needed, and several plants are employed in the same way. The most important of the terrestrial waters are the streams and these will be treated in the next chapter. Among the minor figures who have some connexion with water must be included the Gandharvas and Apsarases.

## 10. Rudra 

Still less than Viṣņu has Rudra the greatness which in the later literature attends him. He is the subject of but three hymns in the Rigveda, shares one with Soma, and is mentioned in all only about seventy-five times. In the Rigveda he has braided hair, like Püṣan, beautiful lips, firm limbs; his colour is brown, and he is multiform. He is essentially radiant (śuci), bright as the sun or gold, resplendent, the Asura of heaven; he wears golden ornaments and sits on a chariot seat. The Yajurveda and the Atharvaveda have much more to tell of his appearance: the latter calls his belly blue, his back red, his neck blue, and mentions his mouth and his teeth. The Yajurveda 7 calls him copper coloured and red, and his neck is blue-black (nilagriva), though his

throat is white (śitikantha);1 it mentions that he is clothed in a skin and dwells in the mountains. 

The character of Rudra in the Rigveda is distinctly formidable: he wields the lightning and the thunderbolt and is an archer, but his fierce character is not manifested as that of Indra in his onslaughts on demons, for that is no part of his nature. He is as destructive as a terrible beast, the ruddy boar of heaven. He is unassailable, rapid, young, unaging, ruler of the world, and its father. From this side of his nature may be derived his aspect as wise, beneficent, bountiful, easily invoked and auspicious (śiva), but the last epithet,* which furnishes the late Vedic name of the god, is not appropriated to him even in the Atharvaveda. He is also a god of healing; he has healing remedies, the chief being Jalășa,3 which is explained variously as the Soma or as the rain, whose property as healing is recognized freely in the Rigveda. Nor is this element in his nature a minor one: it is given as one of his characteristic in a hymn, where the gods are named only by their epithets, and both the Rudras and the Maruts are mentioned with him in this connexion. 

3 

On the other hand the majority of the passages of the hymns, which deal with him, are concerned with deprecating his wrath, and praying that his shaft may not fall upon his worshippers, their parents, children, men, cattle, or horses; he is besought to avert his great malevolence and his bolt from his worshippers, to avert from them his cow- and man-slaying weapon. He is even once directly called manslaying.* 

6 

Rudra is in the Rigveda closely associated with the Maruts, whose father he is and who are often spoken of as the Rudras or the Rudriyas. He bears also once the epithet Tryambaka, which appears to mean having three sisters' or ' mothers'; the interpretation of the reference as an allusion to the three divisions of the universe is possible enough, as the allusion is not made in an early hymn. In one passage of the Rigveda he is identified, among other gods, with Agni.5 

In the later Samhitās and in the Brāhmaṇas Rudra has become, like Visņu, and with him, one of the two great gods of the Brahmans. Some of his aspect as a god of healing is still remembered: the Sutras prescribe offerings to him for the sake of the cattle, and he is lord of cattle; doubtless in part this

attribution of cattle to his care may be due to the anxiety of their owners to induce him to spare them from his wrath, but the other side of his figure may also be a factor in producing the result. On the other hand his malevolence is very prominent: his wrath is continually deprecated, he is invoked not to assail his worshippers with celestial fire, and to make his lightning fall else- where. He is said in the Atharvaveda1 to attack with fever, cough, and poison, and that Veda also conjures up the image of his wide-mouthed howling dogs, who swallow unchewed their prey. In the Çatarudriya litany he bears the most remarkable epithets, which designate him as the patron of robbers, highwaymen, cheats, swindlers, and other similar people.

The express and complete identification of Rudra with Agni, which is first found only incidentally in the Rigveda, is now a received feature of his nature and the principle is widely extended. In the Yajurveda the names of Çarva and Bhava are ascribed to him, while in the Atharvaveda * these two seem still to be separate gods, who, however, have destructive arrows and lightnings. In a later passage they are called his sons, as Mahādeva, and compared with wolves. A late part of the Vājasaneyi Samhita' enumerates as forms of the one god Agni, Aśani, Paśupati, Bhava, Çarva, Mahādeva, Iśana, and Ugradeva with others. In the Brahmanas & is found a list of names of Agni as Rudra, Çarva, Paśupati, Ugra, Aśani, Bhava, and Mahan Deva, while Çarva, Bhava, Paśupati and Rudra are said to be names of Agni. Aśani obviously means lightning, and is so explained by the Çatapatha Brāhmaṇa, but according to the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa it is equivalent to Indra. The Vājasaneyi Samhitā 1o also gives Ambika as the sister of Rudra : she seems to be derived from the epithet Tryambaka: later on she appears as his mother; his wife, Umă Haimavati or Pārvati, appears first in the Taitti- riya Aranyaka 11 and the Kena Upaniṣad.12 

In the Brāhmaṇas we find the power of Rudra at its height. The gods even are afraid lest they be killed by the god. Under the name of Mahadeva he is essentially the slayer of cattle, and he is said to be prone to slay men 13 His

Rudra

145 

origin is traced in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,1 to the evil deed of Prajapati in consorting with his own daughter; the gods in their anger make up the most appalling of beings, who pierces the father god and thus asserts outraged morality. Another story in the same Brähmana * reveals him as a great black * being who appears on the place of sacrifice, and claims all that is over as his own, a claim which Nabhanediṣṭha is told by his father must be recog- nized as being valid. In the ritual we find that he is marked out emphatically from the other gods: at the end of the sacrifice a handful of the strew is offered to him to propitiate him,* at the end of a meal any food left over is placed in a spot to the north for him to take; his abode is in the north, while the other gods abide in the east, the place of the rising of the sun. The bloody entrails of the victim are made over to his hosts, which attack men and beast with disease and death, in order to avert their anger ; • the red colour of the god is the colour of fire and of blood. Moreover, the snakes are clearly conceived as being among his servants. When the gods reached heaven, it is said, Rudra was left behind. Still more important is the tendency seen to generalize the operations of Rudra: in the Çatarudriya litany of the Yajurveda he is credited with activity in almost every aspect of nature, in the mountains, the woods, the paths, and the streams. So in the ritual it is prescribed that offerings should be made to Rudra in the most manifold places and on varied occasions. In a place infested by snakes one should offer to Rudra who lives among the snakes, at a mound of manure to Rudra who is lord of cattle, in a river to Rudra who lives in the waters, at a cross way to Rudra of the roads, at sacred trees, at the place of sacrifice and so on.10 A verse in the Yajurveda reveals to us Rudra as a god haunting the lonely woods; the cowherds, and the maidens, who are drawing water, catch a glimpse of him. He haunts the 

hills and is closely related to the trees, on which he deposits his weapons when he lays them aside.12 It is clear that this wide extension of his power, which applies to the waters and to the fish in them and to the whole animal and vegetable kingdom, is due to a deliberate tendency to see in him a god with a comprehensive control over all nature. 

Another sign of the greatness of Rudra is found in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa: 18 it is prescribed that a formula must be altered from the form in which it occurs in the Rigveda in order to avoid the direct mention of the name of the god this is clear proof of advance in the conception of him since the Rigveda. In another passage of the same text he is never named, but is referred to as

*the god here', and the same avoidance of direct use of the name is to be seen elsewhere.1 

In the late Sütra literature we find ascribed to him the names of Hara, Mrda, Çiva and Çankara; the last three at least are evidently intended to be euphemistic; the great and dread god must be treated as auspicious'in order to make him so in point of fact. The specific account of him as the lord, or the great god, shows a development of his character even within the period of the later Samhitās, for these epithets are not found in the earlier books of the Vājasaneyi Samhită, but only in the later portion of that text.3

The original nature of Rudra is far from clear. The name itself is clearly derived from the word rud, which India tradition takes as having the normal meaning of cry: the suggestion of Pischel * that rud means to be ruddy or, as Grassmann suggests, to shine, must be regarded as too hypothetical to found any theory upon. From the etymology Weber derives the view that the deity was originally the howling of the storm, the plural therefore denoting the Maruts, but that the deity as known to the Yajurveda is essentially a com- pound of the two gods of fire and storm, both being alike in their sound. The view of Hillebrandt insists that Rudra is the deity of the hot season in India from the advent of summer to the autumn, and he points out that it is possible that this idea was associated with some constellation as in the conception saevus Orion. He also points out that Rudra appears in conjunction with the archer Krśānu and with Tiṣya, who is generally regarded as a constellation, and that the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 7 makes the myth of the slaying of Prajāpati to have an astronomical signification, Prajapati in his form as a deer becoming the Mṛga, which the commentary explains as the constellation Mṛgaśiras, Rudra the Mṛgavyādha, Prajāpati's daughter in antelope form the constella- tion Rohiņī, and the arrow with which Prajapati was pierced the Iṣu Trikāṇḍā in the sky. But he recognizes that any precise identification is not to be obtained by the material available. L. v. Schroeder, on the other hand, insists that Rudra is nothing more than the elevation to the rank of a high god of the chief of the souls of the dead: it is an idea, for which almost an indefinite amount of evidence is forthcoming, that the souls of the dead rush along in the storm winds and that besides being terrible they bring with them blessings to cattle. Oldenberg,' while noting this as a possible source of the character of the god, prefers to point out the similarity of the nature of Rudra 1 iii. 38. Cf.

in its essence to such figures as the mountain and wood gods or demons, like Mars Silvanus, the Fauni,1 and so on, and he also points out that it is a common idea that disease comes from the mountains. Moreover, this view suits the connexion of Rudra with the north, since in India the mountains of importance to the Vedic Indians were in the north. Uma, who is given in late texts to Rudra as wife, is styled Haimavati, from the Himavant. 

The chief defect of these views is that they are based too exclusively upon the later accounts of the nature of the god, which really represent a time when he is ceasing to be connected with the original natural basis, on which the conception rests. There is nothing in the conception of the god as he is found in the Rigveda, which cannot be explained by the idea of a storm god con- sidered mainly in the form of lightning, the tempest being viewed on its destructive rather than its healing aspect. From this could be derived easily the god's character as father of the Maruts, while from the beneficent rains loosened by the storm comes the aspect of him as a healing god, which is an essential feature of his character in the Rigveda and without which indeed he could hardly have been accepted as a god by the religion of the Rigveda. This theory explains in a satisfactory manner his connexion with Agni, which is close and obvious. Moreover, the theory of the original relation of Rudra with the dead is contradicted by the fact that he never appears in any close connexion with the dead: he is not their king, nor does he lead them to, or receive them in, his realm; his is the Svähä not Svadhā call in the offering; his place is the north, not the south, which is essentially that of the dead, and, though in certain aspects the ritual of the dead has analogies with that for Rudra, that point is adequately and naturally explained by the fact that both the dead and Rudra have terrible characteristics. The clear connexion of Rudra with the sky is fatal to Oldenberg's theory, for the period of the Rigveda at any rate. 

The Catapatha Brāhmaṇa* tells us that Çarva was a name of Agni among the eastern people and that Bhava was used among the Bāhīkas, which suggests that in Rudra there have combined the forms of different but kindred gods. A reference to the cult of Rudra by the Vratyas has been seen as the explanation of the curious Vratya hymn of the Atharvaveda 5 and of the ceremonies which are used for the introduction into the Vedic religious life of the non-Brahmanical Aryans. The evidence for this view, however, must be

The Gods and Demons of the Veda 

[Part II 

regarded as quite insufficient to make it even plausible.1 The question, how- ever, does arise whether in the late Rudra we have not the syncretism of more than one deity, and possibly the influence of the aboriginal worship on the Aryan. It is certainly possible that a forest and mountain deity or some kindred god, such as a vegetation spirit, and even a god of the dead may be united with the Vedic lightning god to form the composite figure of the Yajurveda: the view preferred by Oldenberg, that the god is really the same throughout the whole period, and that it is the nature of the tradition which obscures the fact, cannot be accepted in face of the obvious probability of development of religion, and the admitted ease with which deities absorb foreign elements into their character. In the later Çiva there are many traces of conceptions commonly associated with vegetation spirits, and his phallic cult is one which is condemned by the Rigveda, but which doubtless remained as popular among the aborigines as it now is among Çiva worshippers throughout India. 

A very elaborate effort to show that the Rigveda presents a later and priestly conception of Rudra as a celestial deity, a priestly refinement from an ancient cannibalistic death demon, is made by Arbman. He contends that the nature of the post-Vedic Rudra is already indicated very clearly in the later Vedic texts, suggesting that the popular god of the Rigvedie period was very much the same as the post-Vedic deity, and that it is more probable that the priests of the Rigveda transmuted a popular god than that a god such as that of the Rigveda developed by any means into the later Rudra-Çiva. It appears unnatural and unreasonable to accept this suggestion, as opposed to the simple and plausible hypothesis that the later Çiva represents the fusion of more than one deity. We have for such fusion the increasing number of distinct names, which are allotted by the texts to Çiva, as seen both in the Çatapatha Brāhmaṇa and the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, and syncretism of deities is so common and notorious that it seems strange to find so much reluctance to accept what is notoriously a trait of the post-Vedic Çiva, whose cosmo- politan character enables him to absorb local god after god. Moreover, in order to bolster up the view of the primitive chthonic character of Rudra, it is necessary to make the Maruts chthonic also, which is a decidedly implausible view. Further, it is difficult not to recognize the strong differences between Yama, a real death god, and Rudra, which indicate an original difference of origin; they belong to different regions, Yama to the south, Rudra to the north. Everything in the ritual goes to support the view of Rudra as a com- plex figure at the time when it was recorded; he combines clear traits of 

Keith, JRAS. 1918, pp. 155–60. A different but implausible view of the Vrātyas as Kṣatriya Yogins is de- veloped by Hauer, Die Anfänge der Yogapraxis im alten Indien, pp. 172 ff. The epic does not encourage these 

vagaries (Hopkins, Epic Myth., p. 231, n. 2), nor need we see in them Indo- Europeans of uncertain connexion.

divine and chthonic character, as is natural in a god formed by the syncretism of different beliefs. 

Stress is laid by Arbman on the term Tryambaka which is accorded to Rudra in the Rigveda, and which he interprets as referring to the god as having three mothers, a fact which connects him in Arbman's view with the cult of mothers, i. e. demonesses as patron goddesses in medieval and modern India.1 If the connexion were real, we might then see in the Rudra of the Rigveda a figure already complicated by contamination with an aboriginal deity, for there is little evidence or probability of mother worship as Aryan or Indo- European,2 and every sign that it was dear to the Dravidian or other aboriginal population. But the suggested interpretation is wholly dubious; we do not hear later of Çiva as having three mothers, though Skanda has seven, and our only early tradition asserts that Ambikā is the sister of Rudra, not his wife, and that she is the autumn.$ It is, therefore, much more probable that the epithet refers to the god either as connected with three seasons, or as connected with the three worlds, heaven, air, and earth, as is the case with the Maruts and is natural in a god of igneous connexions. It is admitted that with Agni Rudra is most intimately connected, and of Agni nothing is more assured than his triple nature. Nor is it possible to find any support for the view of Tryam- baka suggested by Arbman in the Traiyambaka offering of the Crauta ritual, in which nothing whatever appears to explain the name in this sense, apart altogether from the fact that we have no evidence whatever that the rite in question was known to the Rigveda, and later rites frequently stand in no vital connexion with the original nature of the deities to whom they are addressed or who are invoked in them.5 

Arbman's theory leads to a curious and unnatural result in the case of the intimate connexion with Agni which the texts admittedly reveal, and which is shown by the interchange of Rudra's names with Agni. The obvious explanation afforded by the Rigveda is that Rudra is in a sense fire, for he is a lightning god; to Arbman it is necessary to hold that Rudra's dangerous nature was expressed in the minds of his votaries by the term fire, a conception bizarre and implausible. Moreover we have on every hand evidence of the syncretism of gods in Rudra; Arbman seems to feel doubt over his desperate

The suspension on trees of the offerings at the Tryambaka offering and the Baudhyavihara (below, Chap. 20, § 5) suggests a vegetation or tree ritual, but by no means necessarily. It may be merely a natural mode of offering to the god whose lightning strikes the tree, or to a spirit of the air (Helm, op. cit. i. 245).

suggestion that in the Çatarudriya the term Rudra means the demon', and not Rudra at all, and gives it up for Rudra Västospati. What is obvious is that the great god absorbs, as other great gods have done, a mass of Sondergötter, though in the Çatarudriya form we have priestly ingenuity extending and amplifying Sondergötter in the best manner of the Roman Indigitamenta. It is probably to syncretism again that we owe the connexion of Rudra 1 with thieves, robbers, and highwaymen, whose patron he seems to have been, and from whom, therefore, he is expected to protect his votaries, and we need not press the suggestion that he was regarded himself as tricky, or connect this aspect with the uncertain character of the lightning. Nor in the Vedic texts does he ever become a snake god; his connexion with snakes is only incipient,3 and it becomes much more marked in the epic, showing us clearly the process of identification in its advance. On the other hand, it is probable that some of his characteristics in the later Vedic period come from a god of death; this may primarily be due to identification with Çarva and Bhava, and it is sug- gested in his connexion with birds of evil omen and howling dogs," for such birds and dogs are closely connected with Yama as a god of the dead.

Nor is any useful light shed on Rudra's nature by the endeavour to deduce from the account of the mad Muni in the Rigveda * the picture of Rudra as the god of an orgiastic cult, whose epithet of vyuptakeśa, ' with disordered hair', in the Yajurveda' hints at his exploits as a lord of the orgiastic dance. The fact is that the Rigveda tells us merely that the Muni drinks poison from a cup with Rudra, and the rest of the hypothesis is as baseless as the suggestion that the cup was really a skull. The orgiastic traits of Çiva in the later mythology are doubtless due to the amalgamation with Rudra of a vegetation deity, an Indian Dionysos. 

## 11. The Maruts or Rudras 

The Maruts share in the greatness of Indra, and, therefore, they have a prominent place in the Rigveda, thirty three-hymns being exclusively theirs, while they share seven with Indra, and one each with Puṣan and Agni. They are essentially a troupe, thrice seven or thrice sixty in number, the children

The Maruts or Rudras

of Rudra, whence they are called Rudras or Rudriyas: their mother is Prśni, or a cow, and they come with cows with distended udders: the cows can scarcely be anything other than the swollen rain clouds. Agni is also said to have produced them, and they are born of the laughter of the lightning. Vāyu also is said to have produced them from the womb of heaven, and they are also sons of heaven, they have the ocean for their mother or are self-born. They are brothers of equal age, of equal birth, of one mind and one abode. They have as their bride the goddess Rodasi, and are connected with the goddesses Indrāni and Sarasvati. 

The home of the Maruts is in the three heavens or in the three worlds. Their brightness is one of their leading features: hence they are directly called fires. They are also intimately connected with the lightning, which serves as their spears. On their feet they wear anklets, golden ornaments on their breasts, golden helmets on their heads, they carry the lightning in their hands, and spears on their shoulders. The have also axes of gold, while from Rudra they borrow the bow and arrow, and once even from Indra the thunderbolt. They ride in golden cars drawn by tawny steeds, which are often described as spotted, and called pratīs. But they are also said to have yoked the winds as steeds to the poles of their cars. 

The Maruts are great, young, unageing, terrible like wild beasts, but play- ful like children or calves: they are lions or iron-tusked boars or black swans. The noise of their onset is the roaring of the wind or thunder: they rend the mountains, crush the forests, and whirl up the dust with their steeds, which are the winds. They bring rain with them in their train: a river, the Marud- vṛdhā, bears trace of their power, but the rain they send is as usual sometimes called honey or milk or ghee. The rain which they send comes with the thunder and the lightning. Though they avert heat, nevertheless they are also said to bring the light, to dispel the darkness, and like many other gods. they hold apart the two worlds. They sing a song, or blow a pipe, and their singing strengthens Indra for the slaying of Vṛtra. Sometimes they appear as drinkers of Soma, and even as pious sacrificers, since they are singers.) 

The main deed of the Maruts is the rendering of aid to Indra in the slaying of Vṛtra, though they are mentioned also as aiding Indra's predecessor, Trita, in this feat. Occasionally in place of aiding Indra only, the overthrow of Vṛtra and the winning of the cows are attributed to them. They are styled sometimes sons or brothers of Indra. But two or three times they appear as having left him at the critical moment, and Indra seems to have sought in revenge to slay them, and to have been appeased with difficulty by Agastya, in connexion with a sacrifice which that seer was anxious to offer to them.

on the analogy of agriculturists, as the common folk of the gods (e. g. PB. xviii. 1. 14.; xix. 14. 1; xxi. 14. 3), whom Indra, as a sovereign, shame- lessly plunders (PB. xxi. 1. 1 ff.).

Their connexion with Rudra is also distinctly marked in the deprecation of their wrath, which is several times expressed, and their cow- and man-slaying bolt is referred to, as is that of Rudra. They are said to send evil and to have the wrath of the serpent. From Rudra again comes the fact that they are entreated to bear from the Sindhu, the seas, the mountains, the Asikni, healing remedies, and by rain they are said to bestow medicine, which is no doubt rain like the Jalāṣa of Rudra. From the waters comes no doubt their purifying power.

In the ritual they differ from Vayu in their relation to the Soma sacrifice, as they have a place at the midday and the evening pressings, while the morning pressing alone is the place for Vayu, and they play a considerable part in the four-month offerings. It has been sought to show that their cult is specially connected with the Viśvamitra family and is not a subject of much interest to the Bharadvājas and other priestly families, the Vasisthas for instance being mainly concerned with the relations of Indra and Vayu;, but this theory is not supported by the references in the various books which seem to show throughout a recognition of Indra's relations to the Maruts.* 

For the nature of the Maruts two explanations alone are really plausible : the most natural 3 is that they are the deities of the winds in their aspect as bearing the storm clouds: the mere winds are inadequate to explain the constant association of the gods with fire and lightning. The native tradition is that they are the winds, and the word in post-Vedic literature simply means wind. The name itself throws no light on the conception, as, though the root may be set down as mar, it is wholly doubtful what that root is to mean with the normal view of the nature of the gods, it is taken either as to shine or as to crush, according as it is believed to denote the Maruts as radiant gods, or as the winds which crush the woods. The alternative view is sometimes based on the etymology of mar as to die," and the Maruts are claimed as the spirits of the dead, conceived as storming along in the winds, and then merely as the winds. The view has the support of Kuhn, Benfey," E. H. Meyer, v. Schroeder, and Hillebrandt, but the last alone has made any serious attempt to prove his thesis. He calls attention to the fact that the Maruts are sometimes treated in a manner analogous to Rudra or the Manes. Thus, after an offering to Indra on one occasion, a quite separate offering is made to them, 10 and the reason alleged is that they are not eaters of the obla- tion as gods proper are; 11 they also receive an offering of an embryo, which is

normally not fit for sacrifice, they appear as destroying offspring,1 as seeking to injure the sacrifice, as barring men from advancing through their realm of the air. Moreover, they are often regarded as like birds, and birds are often the souls of the dead. Hillebrandt lays no stress on the etymology of the word, and even seems to think that the derivation may be from the Dravidian word marutta, a medicine man, but, in view of the late date at which the Dravidian word is known, this is quite an impossible and unscientific sugges- tion. But the main ground of this thesis cannot obviously be taken seriously. The connexion with Rudra explains the special treatment of the Maruts at certain sacrifices, while, for the most part, as connected with Indra, they have an honourable share in offerings. The connexion with birds is most natural of the winds, and needs no reference to the souls of the dead, and often they have connexion with the Adityas."

Arbman, developing and improving upon a suggestion of Hillebrandt's regarding the double sense of the Maruts as he storm winds and also the hosts of Rudra, representing various aspects of his nature, holds that in the Rigveda the Maruts are the Rudras, while after that the Rudras become a host of demons, quite different from the Maruts, late Vedic times forgetting the connexion of Rudras and Maruts. This is no doubt an exaggerated view. The process is not one of sudden or vehement change; the extension of Rudra's nature carries with it the development of the character of his troupes; the Rudras are wider in character than the Maruts per se would have been. But it is a complete error to treat the Rudras as demons, because they are destruc- tive and sometimes act in an evil way as demons might do ; ' equally on this theory most Vedic gods might be made out to be demons. The contention that the Rudras are demons, because Rudra is lord of beings, Bhûtapati,10 is wholly untenable; Bhuta does not, as suggested, in the Vedic literature, until possibly a very late period, bear the sense demons', but it denotes 

beings' pure and simple.
