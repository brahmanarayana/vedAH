## 1. Dyaus the Father 

DYAUS has the honour of being the only Indo-European god who is certainly to be recognized as having existed in the earliest period, and he has been claimed for that time as a real sovereign of the gods, much as Zeus among the Greeks. For this view there is clearly no cogent evidence available, though equally there is no cogent evidence to the contrary, for the fact that Dyaus is not a great god in India may be di e to decline in greatness, not to the absence of such greatness originally. In the Rigveda he has not a single hymn of his own, and his appearance is nearly always in one or other of two capacities: either he is the parent, who has as children Ușas, the Aśvins, Agni, Parjanya. Surya, the Adityas, the Maruts, and the Añgirases, or he is coupled with the earth, Pṛthivĩ, or at least mentioned with other deities of whom Pṛthivi is normally one2; the legend of the union and separation of the two is often referred to, but without detail. Where he stands alone, he is mentioned as father of Indra, of Agni, as a father, as rich in seed, as a red bull which bellows downward, or, by another theriomorphic idea, as a black steed decked with pearls, an obvious allusion to the midnight sky. He smiles through the clouds, a trait which can only refer to the lightening sky, and an incipient anthropomorphism appears in the statement that he holds the bolt. With Pṛthivi he shares six hymns, but they have little force or significance; of more interest is the fact that sky and earth are called the two mothers, and that not rarely the word dyaus is feminine, a fact which shows that much weight cannot be laid on the contrast between male and female, stress upon which as a principle of Vedic religion has been laid by Bergaigne. With the higher life of the community Dyaus has little to do; he bears the usual title of the great gods, Asura, and with earth he is asked to avert sin committed against the gods or a friend or the head of the clan, but this is merely an application to the god of a commonplace prayer. The Vedic evidence

is, it should be noted, clearly opposed to the view of Warde Fowler,1 which does not recognize physical paternity as the primitive sense of pater in religion.2 

## 2. Varuna, Mitra, and the Adityas 

The slight prominence of Dyaus in the Indian period is doubtless in part at least due to the prominence of Mitra and Varuņa, of which pair the greatest by far is Varuna. Mitra, indeed, by his close association with Varuna has lost any real independence of character. Though Varuna is anthropomorphic and has arms, hands, feet, walks, drives, sits, eats, and drinks, the cosmic character of his eye is brought very clearly: the eye of Mitra and Varuna is repeatedly declared to be the sun, and it figures conspicuously in all the hymns regarding Varuņa. Varuņa is also far-sighted and thousand-eyed: he wears a golden mantle and a shining robe. He and Mitra drive with the rays of the sun as with arms, and like Savitṛ and Tvastṛ they are beautiful handed. In striking contrast with this picture of a fair god is that suggested by a passage in the Çatapatha Brāhmaṇa, where Varuņa is described as a bald yellow-eyed old man; but this passage must be read in its context, from which it appears clearly that we have to deal not with a primitive, but with a mystical, view of the nature of Varuņa. 

3 

Like other gods, Mitra and Varuņa have a chariot which they mount in the highest heaven, and in heaven is their golden abode, which is lofty with a thousand columns and a thousand doors. To that palace resorts the all-seeing sun to report to Varuņa the deeds of men: in it the Fathers behold him, and the Çatapatha Brāhmaṇa represents Varuņa as seated in the midst of heaven, gazing upon the places of punishment around him. 

4 

With Mitra, or alone, Varuņa is often styled a king; he is king of both gods and men, of all that exists, of the whole world. He bears also the title of independent ruler (svaräj) which is more specially Indra's, and, much oftener than Indra, he is called universal monarch (samrāj), a title found a few times also of Agni. With Mitra and twice also with Aryaman, he is accorded the attribute of sovereignty (kṣatra) which is elsewhere given but once each to Agni, Bṛhaspati, and the Aśvins; similarly the term ruler is given to him in four of its five occurrences, and but once to the gods in general. He and Mitra are the noble lords of the gods, and the epithet Asura is given to him in proportion far oftener than to Indra and Agni.

Varuṇa, Mitra, and the Ādityas

Characteristic of the two gods is their mystic power, Māyā.1 With it Varuņa measures out the earth with the sun as with a measure; Varuņa and Mitra make the sun to cross the sky, the rain to fall, and send the dawns. All physical order is subject to the control of Varuna with or without Mitra: the law of Varuna holds earth and sky apart; the three heavens and the three earths are deposited within him; heaven, earth, and air are supported by the two gods; the wind is the breath of Varuna. By his ordinances the moon moves at night and the stars shine. He embraces the nights and establishes the mornings. He regulates the seasons: the kings, Mitra, Varuna, and Aryaman, dispose the autumn, the month, day and night. From another point of view Mitra and Varuna are essentially connected with rain, and among the gods they are most frequently invoked to bestow the gift of rain. Occa- sionally even in the Rigveda Varuna appears connected with the waters of the ocean, to which flow the seven rivers, but the ocean 2 is little known in the Rigveda, and his real connexion with water is that with the waters of the air, whence comes it that in the Naighanṭuka he is ranked as an aerial no less than a celestial god. 

But more important than these physical attributes of the god are his moral qualities, his control of the order of the world in its ethical aspect no less than in its physical, his connexion with the worshipper as the saviour in time of peril and distress, the freer from sin, the merciful god, as well as the punisher of the sinner to whom he sends the disease, dropsy, which accords with his nature as lord of the waters. This characteristic of Varuņa is one which will most conveniently be considered below (Chap. 16), but it is essential to note that this side of Varuna's nature is one which steadily disappears in the later texts, though it does not absolutely vanish.3 

In the later literature there are other marked changes in the character of the god. In the first place Mitra and Varuna come to be placed into relation with the sun and the moon respectively: Mitra is said to have produced the day, Varuna the night: the night is Varuna's, the day Mitra's. In the Atharvaveda 4 it is said ‘At evening he is Varuņa, Agni; Mitra he becometh arising in the morning' and 'That which Varuna hath drawn together, shall Mitra asunder part in the morning.' Even more significant is the fact that in the ritual to Mitra and Varuna respectively white and black victims are sometimes ascribed there can be no doubt of the significance of this dis- tinction in treatment of the two gods. In the second place there is a marked

tendency to reduce Varuņa to the control of the waters. In the Atharvaveda 1 he is connected with the waters as is Soma with the mountains; his golden house is in the waters; he sheds rain waters, and he and Mitra are the lords of waters. In the Yajurveda similarly the waters are his wives, and he is the child of the waters, in which he establishes his abode, and Mitra and Varuna are the leaders of the waters. It is true that for these conceptions close parallels exist in the Rigveda, but the essential feature is that, in the new matter supplied by these Vedas, nothing which is not specifically connected with the waters is of much account. It is quite possible that the connexion with the moon aided the connexion with the waters, but this cannot be proved; in the Brāhmaṇas we find not merely the recognition of the connexion of the moon with rain, but equally the view that rain comes from the sun. Some force may be assigned to the view that with the growing knowledge of the ocean the tendency to restrict Varuņa to that element increased parallel with the steady decline in the importance attached to the moral aspect of Varuņa as a universal ruler. 

Apart from his connexion with Varuna we know little of Mitra: one hymn alone is given to him in the whole of the Rigveda,3 whence we learn that he brings men together by the utterance of his voice, and watches the tillers with unwinking eye. In one passage Savity is identified with him, and Visnu is said to take his three steps by the laws of Mitra, whence it may be assumed that he is supposed to regulate the course of the sun. 

The name 

6 

4 

is normally supposed to have been derived from the use of the word as friend, with which accords the fact that Mitra is essentially a kindly god, and in the Taittiriya Samhita appears as promoting concord: Oldenberg 5 has sug- gested that the use of the word arises rather from the name of the god whom he believes to have been invoked in compacts, perhaps with the use of a fetish of the god as part of the rite and the seven steps, which are mentioned in the Rigveda as a bond of friendship, and which in the marriage ritual are an essential part of the rite. The Iranian Mithra is obviously the same god, and, as his sun nature is almost absolutely certain, it is reasonable and natural to ascribe to the Vedic Mitra the same character. It is no objection to this view that the sun is described as the eye of Mitra: apart from the fact that the separation of the god from the natural substratum is perfectly natural, and can be seen in progress even in the Avesta where Mithra comes forth over the mountain of sunrise before the sun, it must be remembered that, in association with Varuna, Mitra can easily have obtained a description which strictly- applied only to Varuņa. 

The Adityas form a somewhat indefinite group of gods: in the Rigveda they are accorded six whole hymns and portions of two others. The original number is slightly uncertain; once only in the Rigveda is it given as seven,

and once 1 also as eight, but in that passage the priority of seven is clearly shown by the fact that it is stated that Aditi, their mother, at first presented only seven to the gods, and the eighth, Mārtāṇḍa, sprung of a dead egg,' came afterwards. The number seven is also found observed in the ritual of the Yajurveda 2 at a time when unquestionably the number twelve was normally accepted for the Adityas. But the Rigveda at no time enumerates more than six and that once only, when the list is Mitra, Aryaman, Bhaga, Varuna, Dakṣa, and Anśa. Sürya, however, is an Aditya in the Rigveda, and he may be taken to make up the seven, with Mārtāṇḍa as the setting sun as the eighth. The Atharvaveda3 gives Aditi eight sons and the Taittiriya Brāhmaṇa gives their names as Mitra, Varuņa, Aryaman, Añśa, Bhaga, Dhātṛ, Indra and Vivasvant. The term Aditya is, however, applied to Indra, once in connexion with Varuņa and once as the fourth Aditya. The Aditya par excellence, however, is Varuņa, next comes Mitra, and next Aryaman. In the Brāhmaṇas the number of the Adityas is normally fixed at twelve, and they are identified with the twelve months. This explanation of their number is much more natural and plausible than the view of Oldenberg that the number is borrowed from the Jagati metre which is associated with the Adityas. In the Maitrāyaṇī Samhitā " we find Indra distinguished expressly from the group of twelve. More generally, however, all the gods seem not rarely to be styled Adityas, as is natural enough since the only real character- istic the group can be said to possess is that they are the gods of the light of the heaven. 

5 

The Adityas, sons of Aditi, as their name denotes, are bright, golden, un- winking, sinless, pure, and holy. They hate falsehood and punish sin; they fetter their enemies, but protect as with armour their votaries, and forgive their wickedness; sickness and distress they repel, and grant the usual boons of long life and offspring. 

Of the individual deities Aryaman, who is Indo-Iranian in character, and may even be akin to the Irish ancestor Airem, has practically no distinctive feature save his friendly nature which makes him a parallel with Mitra : the word also denotes groomsman, and this idea is, it seems, associated with the god, who is thus brought into connexion with human life and marriage. His path is alluded to, whence Indian tradition regards him as the sun, but Weber as the milky way.' Bhaga, as his name denotes, is the bountiful, or perhaps rather the god of good fortune, the disposition which produces in a woman luck in marriage, for a man success in the assembly, in the hunt, în dicing, or in winning pupils, and plays on the name of the god are not un- natural in a religion so full of the spirit of greed for the bounty of the patrons

of the priests; Dawn is his sister, and Yāska describes him as presiding over the forenoon. His name is the equivalent of the Avestan bagha, god,' which is an epithet of Ahura himself, of Bagaios in Phrygia, and of the Old Church Slavonic bogu, 'god'. Anśa is mentioned but three times in all his name denotes the apportioner and nothing but his bounty is recorded. Dakṣa occurs about twice as often, and is a more interesting figure; in one hymn of the late tenth book 2 he is said to be the father of Aditi and also the son of Aditi, and the gods are made later in origin: in another passage the existent and non-existent are said to have been in the womb of Aditi, the birthplace of Dakṣa. The word means no more than ‘clever ', and there can be no doubt that he is the product of priestly ingenuity. The Adityas and also Mitra and Varuņa are called sons of skill, just as they are called sons of strength: from this epithet the element skill has been elevated into the name of a god, and in the Çatapatha Brāhmaṇa 3 Dakṣa is exalted to the rank of Prajāpati: at no time can he have been anything but a mere abstraction of a type especially dear to the later priestly intelligence, which delighted in the conception of the god, who was at one and the same time the father and the son of his mother. The natural conception which lies at the root of Varuna and the Adityas, is, it is clear, far from obvious. Both Varuna and the group of Adityas have lost or never had immediate connexion with nature, and have developed their individuality in such a way as to make their original identity uncertain. Con- trast with Indra shows that Varuna's original nature must have been some- thing which afforded little chance of the growth of mythology: practically no myth is connected with Varuņa at all, while the strong god Indra is the subject of by far the greater number of Vedic myths. The name of Varuņa gives little assistance it has been connected with the Greek Ouranos, but the phonetic correspondence is not yet clearly made out, and the identity must remain doubtful: it seems naturally to be derived from the root vr, cover, so that the first meaning would be the coverer or encompasser, and native tradition explains it in this sense as the god who envelops like darkness or covers with his bonds. If so, the parallel and contrast with Vṛtra are interesting. It is possible that it originally was an epithet of sky, as the all-encompassing, but it would be too dangerous to lay any stress on the apparent etymological sense as denoting the character of the god.

the sun, and he with the Adityas, of whom he is one, were not originally Indo-European gods, but were borrowed by the united Indo-Iranian people from some Semitic race, which had a more advanced knowledge of astronomy than the Vedic Indians, and which knew the five planets, which with the sun and moon made up the seven Adityas. But he does not consider that, when the gods were taken over, they were really fully understood in their original nature by the Indo-Iranians, and in particular he believes that the strongly ethical aspect of Varuna had already been developed, since this fact alone can explain how a moon god took precedence of the sun god Mitra. He rejects of course connexion with Ouranos, and he lays stress on the fact that these two gods seem a distinct innovation as compared with the ordinary Indo-European gods. The conception of Varuņa as moon god is also shared by Hillebrandt 1 and by Hardy. 

The arguments of Oldenberg are of importance and weight: it is perfectly true that the moral quality of Varuņa and of the Adityas is of a different species from that of Indra and most of the other members of the Vedic pantheon, to whom morality is rather an outward accretion than an internal principle. It is true also that the history of Indian religion is one of the decadence of Varuna before the claims on the one hand of the warrior god Indra, the god par excellence of the Indian warrior, and on the other hand of Agni, the god of the sacrifice and of the sacrificial priest, and of Prajāpati, in whom the cos- mological and pantheistic views of the more reflective section of the priest- hood found their expression. Prajapati is from the philosophic point of view a much greater personage than Varuna, but he has no real connexion with morality, just as the philosophy of India has no place in which to ascribe to morality any real value. But to hold that this ethical quality must have been introduced from without not only into Indian, but also into Iranian religion, seems to go far beyond what can be made even probable. What ground have we, it must be asked, for denying to the people of Iran the capacity of develop- ing such deities for themselves? The reform of Zoroaster is a proof that Iran was capable of moral fervour and energy, and that Iran was subjected to effective Semitic influence has been rendered most improbable. The decline of Varuna in India is not a proof that the Vedic Indians were incapable of having such a deity as Varuņa brought with them from earlier Iranian homes, but that the effect of the admixture of race in India itself was fatal to the 

whence Mitra's nature as this sun (Les Indo-Européens, pp. 172 ff.). He sees a triad in India, Varuņa, Mitra, Aryaman, parallel to Ahura Mazdah, Mithra, Anahita, and thinks the number seven connected with the seven spirits of good and evil, Igigi and Anunnaki.

conception of Varuņa. Moreover, borrowing of deities can only be made plausible when the precise deity borrowed can be specified and identity of character indicated if not proved, and when the name in addition can be traced. In the case of Varuna and the Adityas the effort to show the group of deities which has been borrowed cannot even be made, and the suggestion of borrowing is therefore methodologically unsound. 

Nor is there really any insuperable difficulty in finding another naturalistic basis for Varuņa and an explanation of his moral authority. The old view that Varuna is the all encompassing sky is not open to any serious objection. It explains perfectly well all that he does in the physical world: his place, in the highest heaven, his sending of rain, the fact that the sun is his eye, his epithet of far-seeing, his thousand eyes which doubtless point to the stars of night- possibly his spies, though that conception may be otherwise explained as belonging to the conception of him as king1 it is no objection that Varuņa is represented as mounting a car in the highest heaven with Mitra: the god is clearly to some degree detached from his material substratum, and therefore is treated in this point as any other deity. The conception of an almighty ruler is most casily developed from the vast expanse of the sky, on which the sun moves in its regular course, and which seems to gaze upon the deeds of men. It is of course impossible to prove that Zeus has attained his position in the Hellenic pantheon entirely in this way, but the parallel is certainly striking enough to render the view that Varuņa thus became a great moral ruler reasonable enough. 

On the other hand the comparison of the Adityas and the Ameša Spenta seems certainly right and the objections which have been raised to it are not of a serious kind. It is true that neither in India nor in Iran is the number seven absolutely fixed, but as early as the Rigveda the number seven is evidently becoming the normal one, and similarly in the Avesta the number seven is springing up, in the close connexion between Zoroaster and six other spirits. The fact that these six spirits do not correspond in name or function precisely with the Indian deities is of no consequence, if we adopt the view that the deities were not in the Indo-Iranian period very closely connected with any sphere of nature. This is certainly supported by the obvious fact that in India the figures of Bhaga, Anśa, Dakṣa, and Aryaman are abstract, while the whole six in Iran are of this type. To presume an independent 1 Foy, Die königliche Gewalt, pp. 80-6; * See Macdonell, Ved. Myth., p. 44; Hille- 

Moulton (op. cit., p. 61) inclines to deny any celestial character in the god; von Schroeder (Arische Religion, i. 343) finds two roots of Varuņa's character, the observation of the glories of the sky and the consciousness of the moral law, in harmony with his belief in the latter consideration as one of the three essential roots of religion, beside nature worship and belief in souls.

development of the ideas in both countries is really to assume something much more improbable than a common origin. Oldenberg's theory that the five other than Mitra and Varuņa represented the planets is wholly without sup- port either in Iran or India, where the knowledge of the planets cannot be attributed at all to the age of the Rigveda or even much later. 

Varuna, Mitra, and the Adityas 

Apart from the question of Semitic origin the identification of Varuņa with the moon is absolutely without support. It can only be justified by the later Samhitās, which, however, are far more readily explained by the obvious fact that Varuna was being superseded in his position of greatness by Indra, Agni, and Prajapati, and that accordingly it was natural for the priest to seek to find some position for him, which would naturally explain his connexion with Mitra, whose nature as a sun god was never forgotten in Iran or India. With the hypothesis of Varuņa as a moon god might, of course, be brought into connexion the fact that the Adityas are seven, which has also been cited for their Semitic origin. But there is no rel proof of the existence of any knowledge in Vedic India of a seven-day week,1 and it may be added that, save for the Jewish seven-day week, no such period is proved for any Semitic civilization at an early date. 

Yet another view of the position of Varuņa and Mitra is that presented by E. Meyer. He sees in them later productions of the religious conception : while Indra, if not in name, at least in essence, is an Indo-European god, being really one aspect of the sky god, Varuņa and Mitra are essentially pro- ducts of the Indo-Iranian period of religious thought, and the Asuras never are on the same level with the Devas: in India for a time, that is in the period of the Rigveda, they seem to have been to some extent recognized as at least equal with the Devas, and Varuna actually in some circles ranked above Indra, but this condition did not last, and, while in the case of Iran the Zoroastrian reform developed the essential character of the Asuras and made the Daēvas demons, in India the Asuras sank to demons, and Varuņa was relegated to the position of lord of the sea, while Mitra was little but a name. The origin of the deities he traces in moral, not natural concepts, the nature connexion of the gods being due to the inability of primitive thought to remain at the high pitch of moral conception. Mitra is primarily the lord of the contract, that between individual men no less than that between clans and states, while Varuna is the god of the oath.5 Hence perhaps Varuna is to be deemed to

have been connected with the ocean surrounding the world, by which, as in the case of the Styx in Greek religion, oaths might be taken, and from this connexion with water developed his connexion with the waters of the heaven, the earth, and the ocean alike. But from their moral position the two gods are both essentially celestial, Mitra being especially connected in thought with the sun, while Varuņa was less definitely restricted in his physical range. The possibility of connexion between Varuņa and Ouranos Meyer naturally denies.1 

The evidence adduced to the views of Meyer is inadequate; it is quite clear that Varuņa and Mitra came into special connexion with the agreement and the oath respectively, but neither fact is enough to show that the deity was developed from either conception alone, and we cannot prove that it is more plausible to assume such a derivation than to accept the view that to these great gods of the sky the conception of the control of moral order and contract was naturally assigned. The importance of the sun as a deity is sufficiently shown for Iranian religion by the fact that he became the chief god of the Massagetae, and the importance of Mithra as a sun-god in later Iran is notorious. It is on the other hand more easy to understand how concrete gods attained moral aspects3 than to believe that moral gods became so remarkably concrete in nature.

## 3. Sūrya, Savitṛ, and Pūṣan 

In Surya we have the sun-god in his simplest and most direct form, and ten hymns of the Rigveda are devoted to him. His natural character is very obvious in all that is told of him: he is the eye of the sky or of Varuņa and Mitra he is far-seeing, the spy of the whole world who looks on the deeds of men and rouses them to action. He is an Aditya, but is also distinguished from the Adityas. Like other gods he is a son of Dyaus. In the Purusasūkta he is made to be born from the eye of Purușa, and by an inversion of this idea the eye of the dead man is said to go to the sun. A late and absurd legend of the Atharvaveda makes the sun as Diväkara born from the demon Vṛtra. 

Many gods stand in close connexion with Sürya: from the lap of the dawns he shines forth, and he is also the husband of Dawn: Pūṣan is his messenger, Varuņa, Mitra, Aryaman make his path; Indra, Viṣņu, Soma, Dhātṛ, and the Añgirases all are said to create him or produce him. 

The chief feat of Surya is his shining for the world, for gods, and men : 

1 Feist (Kultur der Indogermanen, p. 843, n. 1) admits the similarity of the two ideas and names, and therefore ascribes them to a non-Indo-Germanic common source ; he treats Saranyû-Erinys, Gandharva-Kentauros, similarly. 

• Herodotos, i. 216. There is no reason to deny the Iranian character of this people, even if it were in part of mixed blood; the similarity of Mongolian 

and Aryan religion is doubtless due to similar conditions of development on the steppes (cf. Minns, Scythians and Greeks, pp. 85 ff.; Meyer, Gesch. des Alt.3 I, ii. pp. 887–95).

he smites away the darkness and triumphs over the powers of darkness and witches; he prolongs the lives of men and drives away sickness, disease, and evil dreams. He is also the divine priest of the gods, and is entreated on his rising to declare men sinless before Mitra and Varuņa. When invoked with Indra he becomes a slayer of Vṛtra. But another myth tells that Indra de- feated him and stole his wheel, a fairly obvious allusion to the obscuration of the sun by the thunderstorm. 

The chariot of the sun is drawn by a single horse, Etaśa, or by seven horses, or seven mares, or by an indefinite number of either. But the more primitive view that the sun himself is a steed is found in one passage,1 where he is said to be the white and brilliant steed brought by Ușas. But he is also a flying bird,2 or an eagle, and a mottled bull. He is also, however, a gem of the sky, 

the variegated stone set in the midst of heaven, a brilliant weapon obscured by Mitra and Varuņa with cloud and rain, the felly of Mitra and Varuna, a brilliant car, or a wheel. In the ritual the hose and the wheel appear as sun fetishes. 

While Sürya represents the concrete aspect of the sun, Savitṛ, the stimu- lator or instigator, seems to denote the sun as the motive power which drives men to action. In some passages the two gods are apparently used as identical, but in others the two gods appear in connexion with each other and as different: Savitṛ is said to impel Sürya, to declare men sinless to the sun, to combine with the rays of the sun, or to shine with the rays of the sun. Savity is also implored to strengthen the worshipper when the sun is risen. 

: 

Savity is pre-eminently a golden god: his eyes, hands, tongue, and arms are of gold: his hair is yellow he wears a tawny garment and fares in a golden car. But, unlike Sürya, he has two, not seven, steeds. The type of his action is the raising of his arms to rouse men: the action of Agni, Bṛhaspati, and the dawns is compared to it. He travels through the air on dustless paths, and is implored to convey the departed souls to the place where the righteous dwell. He grants the gods and men immortality, and makes the Rbhus immortal. Like Sürya, he drives away the evil spirits and the wizards. His power is sometimes extolled in striking terms, as when Indra, Varuņa, Mitra, Aryaman, and Rudra are said not to be able to resist him, and like other gods he supports the sky and extends the earth. 

From Agni he borrows the epithet of son of the waters, and probably also that of domestic: from this connexion also perhaps comes his assignment by the Naighantuka to the aerial as well as to the celestial world. His power of stímulation leads to his identification with Prajāpati in the Brāhmaṇas. With Puṣan he is equated or closely connected: the Savitri verse, which is used in the daily ritual of the orthodox Hindu, occurs immediately after an invocation of the god Puṣan. Bhaga again is identified with Savitṛ, or Savitrṛ with

[Part II 

Bhaga, in the single conception of Savitṛ Bhaga; 1 it is natural that elsewhere he should be distinguished. 

2 

The later tradition of Yāska suggests that the distinction was drawn between Sürya and Savitṛ in that the latter was the sun before his rising and after the dawn; but this conception is artificial, and is not supported by the Rigveda, where rather Savity seems especially invoked at the beginning of the day and at its close, and his sound (śloka) may be compared to the Germanic belief in the noise emitted by the sun in his rising.3 

In nearly half its occurrences the name Savitṛ is coupled with Deva, a fact which strongly suggest that the word still was felt in large measure as an epithet: indeed in two passages the name seems to be given as an epithet to Tvaṣtṛ. It is, of course, possible that, as Oldenberg holds, the god is an abstract deity pure and simple, and that he is merely assimilated to the sun, but the simpler and more natural view is to assume that Savitṛ is one aspect of Surya, the most important aspect of the power which wakens man to his work and the priest to his sacrifice. 

Pûṣan is a curious and enigmatic figure: he is the subject of eight hymns only, five of them in book vi. He has, like Rudra, braided hair, and a beard. He carries not only a spear, but an awl, and a goad. He differs from other deities in that his chariot is drawn by goats, and that he eats mush, either because he is toothless as the Çatapatha Brāhmaṇa 5 declares him to be, or, as is much more likely, for some cause unknown to us, in which case the ascription of lack of teeth to the god is due no doubt to transfer from the habits of men. 

Puṣan shares with the gods in general the usual attributes of strength, glory, wisdom, generosity, and like the Aśvins he is termed wonder worker, while with Agni alone he bears the epithet of Narãśansa, probably felt as * extolled by men'. He is most frequently invoked with Bhaga and Viṣņu of the other gods: in joint laudations he is found with Soma and Indra, while his food is expressly distinguished from the Soma of Indra, nevertheless in one passage it is attributed to Indra, and in two passages the libation to Indra is said to be mixed with it. The characteristic epithets of Pūșan's activity are those which denote him as the bringer of prosperity, who loses neither goods nor cattle. Puṣan is essentially concerned with safefaring on paths he is born himself on the far path of paths, the far path of heaven and earth, and between the two beloved abodes he goes and returns. Hence it follows that he is a guardian of roads, he makes the paths safe by removing the wolf and the waylayer: his epithet vimuco napät may be rendered either 'son of unyoking' after safe arrival, or son of deliverance', and in the Atharvaveda he is definitely called upon to deliver from sin. As he is lord

of the roads and a guide, he is invoked by the man who proposes to make a journey and by the man who on his way is lost.1 In the morning and evening of the Gṛhya ritual, the offering made to Püṣan is performed on the threshold of the house. It is Puṣan who preserves cattle, who keeps them from falling into pits and finds them when lost and brings them again home. He guides straight also the furrow, guards horses, and weaves the coats of sheep. Cattle are sacred to him and he is called the producer of cattle. 

Puṣan has also other than agricultural connexions. He is exclusively called the glowing (āghṛṇi), and once bears the epithet, * not to be concealed,' which is almost peculiar to Savitṛ. With golden ships he moves in the aerial ocean, acting as Surya's messenger under the influence of love. As best of charioteers, he is said to have driven downwards the wheel of the sun. Like Surya too he is the wooer of his mother and lover of his sister: the gods gave him to Surya, the sun-maiden, for a husband. In the marriage hymn he is bidden to take the hand of the bride, to lead her away, and to bless her in her marriage. 

5 

Puṣan again plays a part of the ritual of death: he is entreated to conduct the dead to the fathers, as Agni and Savity lead them to the place of the right- eous, and he conveys them in safety to their destined place. The goat of Puṣan leads the horse when sacrificed to its place. 

• 

The similarity of Puṣan to Hermes is undoubted: both have in common the duty of conducting men or the souls of the dead on the roads: they are closely connected with the herds, confer wealth, act as convoys, are connected with the goat, and even the braided hair of Pũṣan has been compared with the Krobalos of Hermes." But it is impossible to lay much stress on the parallelism in view of the lack of similarity of name, and the difficulty of determining the original character of Hermes is much greater than that of determining that of Puṣan. His name denotes the prosperor, and Yāska distinctly declares him to be the sun. This traditional interpretation is not inconsistent with any of his characteristics: it certainly accounts for his character as glowing, for his connexion with the sun-maiden, and his wealth: again it accounts for his power to show paths, from which it is not difficult to deduce his duty of con- ducting the souls or his going on errands. As the increase-giving sun, his close connexion with cattle is natural: Mithra in Iran, an almost undoubted sun-god, has the power to increase cattle, and bring lost animals home. The goat would be a natural animal to be associated with the god whose duty it was to

go on difficult pathways. As against this natural explanation it is difficult to take very seriously the theory that he is not the representative of any natural phenomenon, but a god of the ways.1 Much of his nature can thus be explained, but not the close connexion with the prospering of cattle and of men which is clearly his, but which cannot without difficulty be deduced from his nature as a god of ways, though attempts to do so may have been known in the oldest times. The only explanation which is possible as an alternative is to regard Püṣan as in origin an animal god, embodied in the goat, or a vegetation spirit which might be conceived in goat shape. much of the mythology would remain wholly unexplained.3 

## 4. Viṣnu 

But in that case 

In the Rigveda Viṣņu can claim but five whole hymns, and his name occurs not more than a hundred times in all. He is said to be young, but vast in body, not a child, and his one action is the taking of three strides : hence he is called the wide strider. Of these strides two are visible, the third is beyond the ken even of the birds, or, as it is also put, his third name is in the bright region of the heaven. But again it is said that the liberal see the highest place of Viṣņu like an eye in the sky. The highest place is Visņu's favourite dwelling, there also are the gods and pious men, there is Indra and the many-horned swiftly moving cows, doubtless the clouds. There can be little doubt as to what the three steps are: the later Saṁhitās, the Brāh- maņas, and Çakapüņi, a predecessor of Yäska, agree in equating them with the three divisions of the universe, and the alternative view of Aurṇavābha that they correspond with the rising sun, the zenith, and the setting is in flat contradiction with the references of the Vedas to the nature of the highest place. The motive for the strides is variously given as for men in distress, to bestow the earth upon man as a dwelling, to obtain wide-stepping existence or the existence of men. Again Viṣņu is essentially the swift of motion and

an ordainer: he measures out the earthly spaces. He sets in motion his ninety steeds with the four names, an allusion clearly to the 860 days of the year, divided into four seasons. He is a dweller on the mountains, and in the Yajurveda1 he is called the lord of mountains. 

Viṣņu is closely associated with Indra: one hymn is devoted to the pair of gods, and, when Viṣṇu is celebrated by himself, Indra is the only other god who is given a place; when about to perform his supreme feat of slaying Vṛtra, Indra implores Vișņu to step out more widely. Through his association with Indra, Viṣņu becomes a drinker of Soma, and he cooks for Indra 100 buffaloes and a brew of milk. Through his connexion with Indra Viṣņu also is associated with the Maruts, with whom he shares honour in one hymn. 

Another side of Viṣņu appears in the statement that he is a protector of embryos, and in his invocation with other deities to promote conception.* Moreover, in one obscure allusion, reference is made to the fact that in battle he assumed a strange form.3 

There can really be little doubt as to the nature of the god. The name can be diversely explained as the active one' from the root vis, or as ' crossing the back of the world or the earthly regions' from vi and snu (akin to sānu), but the solar nature of the deity is reasonably plain. In the Atharvaveda he is asked to bestow heat: in the Brāhmaṇas 3 his head cut off becomes the sun ; in post-Vedic literature his weapon is a rolling-wheel, his vehicle Garuda, the sun-bird, and the breast jewel which he wears is clearly the sun. His dwelling in the mountains may be either derived from the conception of the sun on the cloud mountains, or, more simply, from the idea that he who dwells in the farthest distance must be on a mountain peak. The only alternative theory which requires mention is that of Oldenberg* that he is merely the wide-stepping god, and this has no such probability as to displace the obvious meaning put upon his nature by Vedic India. 

It would be impossible to deny to Visņu the position of a great god in the period of the Rigveda, for that would be to forget that the comparative pro- minence of the gods is not necessarily brought out fully in that collection, which is mainly concerned with the Soma sacrifice, and which does not, there- fore, take great account of those deities who are not of much consequence in that sacrifice. Of course, that the god is not a great god of that sacrifice is to a certain extent a proof that he is not a god regarded with the highest impor-

The Gods and Demons of the Veda 

[Part II 

tance by many of the priests.1 But his interest in human life as a protector of embryos is a sign of his importance in ordinary life, which should not be over- looked. It is quite impossible to make such a detail the ground of the attribution to the god of any other than a solar character, for, as we have seen in the case of Pûṣan, the connexion of the sun with the increase of the animal world is too obvious an idea not to be found in religion. 

2 

In the later Samhitas and the Brahmaņas we find that Viṣņu is assuming an importance and prominence in the minds of the priests which give him, along with Rudra, undoubtedly the leading place in the living faith of the Brah- maņas. His three strides are now definitely located in the earth, air, and heaven, and in imitation of them the sacrificer strides in the ritual the steps of Viṣņu,a which result in placing him in the world of heaven: by this simple act he thus puts himself in the closest connexion with the deity, for in the imitation he doubtless in some measure and degree assimilated himself to the deity. It is of interest that in the Avesta the three steps of the Ameša Spenta from the earth to the sun are similarly imitated, but there is no reason to assume that the two acts are historically derived from an earlier Indo-Iranian usage: such parallels may as easily rise independently. Moreover the three strides become a matter of great importance in the preservation of the world from the Asuras, who, in the imagination of the Brahmaņas, are no longer individual enemies of the gods, but a strong band before whose onslaught the gods are often compelled to yield. The Indian imagination, however, never contemplates the idea of any final victory of the Asuras, but the gods are bound to repel them often by guile and still more often by knowledge of some special rite. Thus in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 3 it is agreed by the Asuras with Indra and Viṣņu that so much of the earth should be assigned to the latter as Visņu could step over with three strides: Viṣņu then proceeds to appro- priate by his strides the worlds, the Vedas, and speech. The Çatapatha Brāhmaṇa declares that Viṣņu by his strides acquired for the gods the all- prevading power which they possess, and the Taittirīya Samhita3 states that by taking the form of a dwarf, whom he had seen, Viṣņu conquered the three worlds. The dwarf form, which is the germ of the post-Vedic story of the dwarf incarnation of Visņu, is found, though not with express mention of the three steps, in the Çatapatha. It is there recorded that the Asuras overcame the gods and began to divide the earth: the gods with Viṣņu, the sacrifice, at their head demanded a share, and the Asuras seeing that Viṣņu was but a dwarf consented to grant them so much as Viṣņu could lie on. The gods then sacrificed with Viṣņu, and won the whole earth to themselves. In this account is to be seen the most important factor in the elevation of Viṣņu to

his rank of a most high god, his constant identification with the sacrifice. The precise train of thought by which this identification was reached cannot be reconstructed with certainty: it is not to be supposed that Visņu's importance is accidental, or due merely to this identification: he must have been a great god both for the people and the priests before he was given the similitude to the sacrifice, the greatest of all things in the estimation of the priesthood, but his identification undoubtedly aided in the increase of that greatness, and made it permanent and abiding. 

1 

In the dwarf form 1 thus assumed by Viṣņu there is no reason to see more than the natural adoption of a cunning device to deceive the Asuras, an idea perhaps prompted not only by the appropriateness of the form in question for the purpose aimed at, but by the common view of men that the misshapen form of the dwarf is accompanied by inhuman cleverness or power, an idea so widespread in the world that there need be no hesitation in believing it to have existed in Vedic India, despite the fact that, naturally enough in view of the scanty knowledge we have of many sides of Indian thought, we have no direct proof of the existence of such a view in Vedic times regarding dwarfs. 

The germ of a further incarnation of Vișnu is found in the Brāhmaṇas in the transformation of a myth, which is found in the Rigveda itself. In that text 2 it is recounted that, having drunk the Soma, Viṣņu carried off a hundred buffaloes and a brew of milk, which belonged to the boar, and Vṛtra, shooting across the mountain, slew the boar. There can be no doubt that this is merely a version of the slaying of Vṛtra, the great work of Indra in the world, and the mountain must be the cloud mountain. In the Taittiriya Samhita3 the boar keeps the wealth of the Asuras concealed on the far side of seven hills: Indra picks up a bunch of Kuśa grass and pierces the hills and slays the boar. Viṣņu, the sacrifice, then carried off the boar as a sacrifice for the gods, and thus the gods attained the goods of the Asuras. Now this boar, which is called Emūṣa from its epithet emusa, fierce, in the Rigveda, is stated in the Çatapatha Brāhmaṇa to have raised up the earth from the waters, and the Taittiriya Samhita further identifies the cosmogonic boar which raises up the earth with a form of Prajapati. From this new aspect of the tale it is an easy step to the making of the boar an incarnation of Viṣņu himself, and this step is actually taken in the Rāmāyaṇa and the Purāņas. The transfer of myths from Pra- jāpati to Viṣṇu is illustrated in an interesting way in the case of two other of his incarnations in post-Vedic literature. The fish, which according to the Çatapatha Brāhmaṇa in the flood legend saved Manu, is identified in the

Mahabharata with Prajapati, but in the Purāņas becomes Viṣņu, and, while in the Brahmaņas 1 Prajapati is stated to have become a tortoise, moving in the primeval waters, when about to create offspring, the Puranas turn the tortoise into an incarnation of Viṣņu, devised in order to recover various objects which were lost in the deluge. 

As the sacrifice Visņu is the subject of a strange myth: 2 through com- prehending the issue of the sacrifice, Viṣņu became the highest of the gods : but this result caused Viṣņu to be unduly puffed up with glory, and yet his greatness was such that no god dared attack him. He was apart from them all with his bow and three arrows, leaning his head on the end of his bow. The ants then undertook, on the promise of the reward of being able to find water even in the desert, to bring him to ruin, and this they accomplished by gnawing the bow string, so that the bow sprang asunder with great vehemence, and the head of Visņu was cut off, becoming the sun. The Taittiriya Aranyaka adds that the Aśvins as physicians replaced the head of the sacrifice, and, as the gods were now able to sacrifice with it in its complete form, they conquered heaven. The myth is an odd and curious one, but to ascribe to it any symbolic sense would doubtless be a mistake. 

In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 3 Visnu is declared to be the highest of the gods and Agni the lowest, but the declaration has no possible reference to the place of the two gods in the hierarchy, but is rather due to the physical situation of the gods, the terrestrial fire, and the sun. It accords also, somewhat artificially, with the fact of the arrangement of the litanies of the two gods in the Soma sacrifice, but it is not probable that originally that was its sense. The Aitareya also declares that Viṣņu is the doorkeeper of the gods, an idea which it supports very ineffectively by the Rigvedic verse, Viṣņu with his friend opened the stall. 

## 5. Vivasvant 

Vivasvant is not the subject of any complete hymn in the Rigveda, where, however, he is mentioned about thirty times. The most important thing about him is his relation to Manu, the ancestor of the human race, who thence bears the name Vaivasvata or Vivasvant, taking simply his father's name as a sign of paternity. Men are also in the Brāhmaṇas styled directly his offspring, and the Rigveda ascribes to him as to other gods the fathership of the gods. His wife is Saraṇyü, the daughter of Tvaṣṭr, and he is the father of the Aśvins. To him and to Matariśvan Agni was first manifested, and he has Mätariśvan or Agni as his messenger. Soma again dwells with Vivasvant and is cleansed by his daughters, doubtless, in the ordinary mythical style of the

Soma hymns, his fingers. In the prayer of Vivasvant Indra rejoices, and places his treasure beside him. Varuna also is mentioned along with him. In one passage the worshippers of the Adityas pray that the well-wrought arrow of the god may not slay them before old age.1 In the Atharvaveda * he is said to protect from Yama. 

The seat of Vivasvant is a special feature of the god it is mentioned five times: in it the singers praise the greatness of Indra or of the waters; the gods and Indra delight in it, nor can it be doubted that it is meant, when it is said that a new hymn is placed in Vivasvant as a centre (nābhi). 

8 

The word vivasvant is used occasionally as an epithet of Agni and Uṣas in the etymological sense of shining forth, which is specially appropriate in the goddess Dawn. The Çatapatha Brāhmaṇa explains the god Vivasvant's name by the doctrine that he illumines night and day, which are connected with him in the Rigveda: it calls him Aditya, and this name is elsewhere found in the Yajurveda,1 and in post-Vedic literature Vivasvant is a name of the sun. 

6 

In the Yasna of the Avesta we find Vivanhvant, father of Yima, who is the first man to prepare the Haoma, the second being Athwya, and the third Thrita. The parallelism is perfect, for not only is Vivasvant the father of Yama, but it is said in one passage of the Rigveda' that Indra drank Soma beside Manu Vivasvant and Trita. From the parallelism it is possible to support the theory of Oldenberg, which sees in Vivasvant nothing more or less than a deification of the first sacrificer, the ancestor of the human race. But the theory is, on the whole, somewhat inadequate to account for all that is said of Vivasvant. His connexion with the Aśvins, with Agni, and with Soma can be explained, as well as the importance laid upon his seat, by the theory that he is the sun, especially the rising sun. This also suits best the obvious etymological sense of his name. Further refinement of his essence, such as making him, with Ludwig," the god of the bright sky, or, with Barth, the heaven of the sun, is hardly necessary. The god in any case bears the appearance of having lost much of his original colour and life.

## 6. The Aśvins

The Aśvins are, next to Indra, Agni, and Soma, the gods most frequently mentioned in the Rigveda, where they claim more than fifty hymns and are mentioned over 400 times. The most constant feature is their duplicate nature: they are compared to eyes, hands, feet, wings, and animals which

[Part II 

go in pairs. They are bright, young, yet ancient, many-formed, beautiful, agile, strong, red, and they possess profound wisdom and power. Alone of gods are they described as having ruddy paths or golden paths. The epithet dasra, wondrous, is almost exclusively theirs, and they are called the Nasatyas, and once the encompassing Nasatya is mentioned alone. The sense of the epithet, which in the singular Nãonhaithya is the name of a demon in the Avesta, is unknown: its great age is proved by its occurrence among the names of the gods of the Mitanni; naturally the Indian mind explained it as not untrue (na-asatya), but the value of such an etymology is obviously nil,1 

The Aśvins are peculiarly connected with honey: they have a skin of honey, the birds of their cars are full of honey; they bestrew the sacrifice and the worshipper with a honey whip, their car is honey hued and honey bearing. They are honey-handed and give the bee its honey. In comparison they are less vitally connected with Soma, though they are said to drink it at each pressing, and in some circles they were probably not at first reckoned among the Soma-drinking gods, though for this 2 the proof is rather inadequate. 

The chariot of the Aśvins has curious qualities: it is not merely golden in all its parts, but it is three-wheeled, has three fellies, and all its parts triple. One of its wheels is said to have come off when the Aśvins went to the wedding of the maiden Sürya, and it is possible that the three wheels are connected with the fact that, unlike other gods, the Aśvins in their chariot bear with them Sürya, for whom, therefore, there must be provided a third seat. Possibly too the triplication, of which much appears in the myths of the Aśvins, owes its being to this simple cause, though it has been traced to the three seasons of the year. The steeds which draw their car are sometimes horses-there is no trace of the Aśvins as horsemen-but more often birds, swans or eagles, occasionally buffaloes, and even a single ass: in the Aitareya Brahmaņa they are said to have won a race at the wedding of Soma and Sürya with a car drawn by asses. Their chariot in a single day traverses heaven and earth, a power attributed also to the chariots of the Dawn and the sun it goes round the sun, and the epithet going round (parijman) is often given to their car or them, as also to Vata, Agni, and Surya. 

3 

The presence of the Aśvins is ubiquitous: they are declared to be in the heaven, the air, in plants, houses, the mountain top, above and below. The 

1 Cuny (Rev. ét, anc. 1909, p. 280) argues that the etymology is strengthened by the mention of the gods in the treaty, but at most this would only prove the early existence of this conception.

time of their appearance, however, is par excellence the early dawn, when they waken Uṣas, or in their car follow after Usas, who is born at the yoking of their car. The appearing of the Aśvins, the kindling of the fire of the sacrifice, the break of dawn, and the sunrise are even treated as simultaneous, but the normal place of the Aśvins is clearly after the dawn and before the sunrise. In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 1 the Aśvins, Ușas, and Agni are stated to be the gods of dawn: they also receive in the ritual red-white animals in accor- dance with their own colour. On the other hand, they have both in the Rigveda and elsewhere offerings at midday and evening as well as at dawn, which, however, is their place par excellence, as they are the recipients of the morning litany, Prātaranuvāka, for which the appropriate time is the period when the dawn has arisen. Their special connexion with the light is shown by the fact that they drive away the darkness and put to flight the evil spirits. 

The Aśvins have many parents: they are children of Dyaus, but also the ocean is their mother; they are the sons of Vivasvant and Saranyū, daughter of Tvastr, and they are the parents of Puṣan and have the Dawn, as it seems, for their sister. But their more important relationship is with the maiden called Sürya or the daughter of Sürya. She is their wife and mounts their car, and she bears the name Aśvini as the outcome of this relationship. But Surya is also the wife of Soma, in which case the Aśvins appear as groomsmen who seek the bride for the husband. In this connexion they are at the marriage of mortals invoked to conduct the bride home to her husband on their chariot. Their connexion with marriage appears also in their being invoked with other deities to make the union fruitful. With this their feats agree: they make the barren cow to give milk, and they bestow a child on the wife of the eunuch. They bring lovers together and they give an old maid a husband. 

2 

(The power of the Aśvins as the helpers in time of trouble is extraordinarily often extolled: no other gods are so steadfastly helpful as they are. They differ in essential features from Indra, who is also a present aid to his devotees. Indra is the warrior god who helps his followers in battle and who brings them in safety across the streams as they advance to attack their enemy. The Aśvins appear not to do combat, but to save those who are in distress of any kind. They are the gods who are connected with the ocean, and they rescue from it in ship or ships. Bhujyu, son of Tugra, was alone in the midst of the ocean in the darkness, or was clinging to a plank in the midst of the waves: the Aśvins heard his supplications and rescued him in a ship of a hundred oars, with four ships, with a winged boat, with three flying cars with a hundred feet and six horses, with their headlong flying steeds, or with their chariot swift as thought. (They are the physicians of the gods, and guardians and granters of immortality and freedom from disease. The old and decrepit Cyavana they released from his decrepitude and made him young again, and desirable to his wife. In the

Çatapatha and Jaiminîya Brāhmaṇas 1 the tale is told at full length, and the centre of it is the magic water, in which Cyavana bathes and so recovers youth and beauty, a motive of world-wide fame. The same story seems to have been told of a certain Kali referred to in the Rigveda. To the young Vimada they brought as a wife Kamadyū, who seems to have been the wife of Purumitra : apparently in so doing they imitated the action of Aphrodite to Helen. Viṣṇāpû, like a lost animal, they found and restored to his father Viśvaka, their worshipper. They revived and saved Rebha who had been stabbed, bound, and cast into the waters, and abandoned as dead for ten nights and nine days. They brought Vandana out of a pit in which he lay as dead. From a burning pit they rescued Atri Saptavadhri, and placed him in a cool place, a feat once attributed to Agni, who may have been deemed to have acted through the Aśvins. A quail was saved by them from the jaws of a wolf. At the prayer of a she-wolf they restored the sight of Ṛjraśva who had slain for her to eat a hundred and one sheep. They cured Paravṛj of his blindness and his lameness. To Viśpala-mare or maiden-whose limb was cut off in battle like the wing of a bird, they give an iron limb. Pedu received from them a strong steed dragon-slaying, and Kakṣīvant abundant blessings including the making to flow for him of a hundred jars of honey or wine from a strong horse's head. Akin to this story is the legend that they placed on Dadhyañc, son of Atharvan, a horse's head, which then told them of the place of the mead of Tvaṣtṛ. 

This is a formidable list of achievements and many more are given by name of the recipients in the Rigveda. For one and all explanations based on natural phenomena have been found: thus the blind man is healed when the sun is released from the darkness-whether of winter, as Max Müller holds, or the arctic, as Tilak, or the rains, as A. C. Das, and it may be that, in many of the incidents, there is more than the mere record of remarkable rescues of real men from misfortunes. There is not the slightest doubt that such rescues might give rise to traditions of the sort recorded in the hymns, but the explana- tion is one which cannot be given with certainty in all cases: the giving of an iron limb to a horse is a feat which no modern could accomplish, and, while it might be ascribed to the Aśvins in recognition of their great powers, still it is rather doubtful if this is enough to explain the incident, though the

suggestion that Viśpală is the first quarter of the new moon is no more plausible. The rescue of the quail from the mouth of a wolf and the slaying of 101 sheep by Ṛjraśva are episodes also which seem mythical. But to recognize that there may be a mythical foundation to a story and to discover that foundation, when the episode is given in the form of a mere reference in a few words in the Rigveda, are totally different things, and it would be contrary to sound method to seek to penetrate the exact force of these legends: it is not difficult to interpret them, but the fatal objection to such attempts is that several ways of interpretation are always open, and that we have no standard of criticism by which to judge of the comparative merits of the different views. 

It is a different matter with the question of the essential nature of the two gods: while that is obscure, some effort to elucidate it is made requisite by the abundance of the material. In the first place, however, it is important to note that in part at least the Indo-European character of the deities is beyond all reasonable doubt: there is a very famous Lettish myth which shows us the two sons--or one son-of a god who are helpers in time of need and who come riding on their steeds to woo the daughter of the sun for themselves or for the moon, just as in the Rigveda the Aśvins are both wooers of the sun- maiden for themselves and also for Soma, the moon. Here the god or gods are also described as the morning star. In the Greek myth of the Dioskouroi and their relation to Helene we have a clear variant of the legend, and the Dioskouroi are of course par excellence the saviours of men, especially at sea.* Moreover, the evidence of Boghaz-Köi, as we have seen, proves the early existence of the Näsatyas,3 and makes it most probable that the Avesta knew them; before the reform of Zoroaster the Nãoǹhaithya must have been great gods. This fact explains in great measure the obscurity of the mythic con- ception of the gods; they have in the course of transmission attained greater personality, and therefore the natural substratum of the gods is hard to recognize.

The difficulty was fully known in the earliest period of Vedic interpreta- tion: Yāska gives as alternative views sky and earth, which is the view of the Çatapatha Brāhmaṇa,3 or day and night, or sun and moon, or two kings, performers of holy deeds. The last view is naturally that of Geldner, who denies their connexion with the Dioskouroi and asserts that they are merely Indian saints who save in time of trouble, a view which is clearly based on a false effort to dissociate Indian from Indo-European mythology. The view

[Part II 

that the gods are sun and moon has the support of Ludwig,1 Hillebrandt," and Hardy, but nothing else whatever can be said for it. The explanations as day and night and sky and earth have equally feeble support, and more plausibility attaches to the suggestion, perhaps made by Yāska and adopted by Goldstücker, that the twilights are meant, the half-dark, half-light period before dawn, and this would account for the fact that one only is said to be a son of Dyaus. The more probable alternative to this view is that of Mann- hardt and Oldenberg, who, on the strength in part of the mention of the morning star and the evening star in the account of the Lettish god or gods, take the two gods to be the morning and the evening star respectively. The difficulty of this conception is, of course, the fact that the gods are so essentially twin, and the view, if adopted, necessitates the supposition that this fact had gradually been obscured. There are indeed some traces of their separate character in the Rigveda itself: thus they are called ' separately born' and 'born here and there', and Yāska preserves a verse of which he 

7 

says: 'One is called the son of night, the other the son of dawn.' This is, it must be admitted, far from convincing evidence of a real recollection of the twin character of the stars, but the suggestion of Weber,8 that they are to be taken as the twin stars of Gemini, is open to the quite fatal objection that there is nothing but the twin nature to commend it. Nor is the loss of the primitive connexion at all impossible, with the growing importance of the morning as the time of sacrifice." 

A very different conception of the nature of the twins is suggested by Harris, 10 whose collections of ethnic materials reveals the idea that of pairs of twins one is often held to have a divine origin, without there being any myth of nature involved. Whatever the value of the theory for other cases, it seems to have no special plausibility for Indian religion,11 in which the natural back- ground is clear, as it is in the Lettish myths, whose importance seems unduly to be depreciated by failure to realize the remarkable character of the parallels with the Indian legends. 

Other questions are suggested by the nature of the steeds of the Aśvins. The conjecture that they were once not merely regarded as borne on chariots with horses, but were conceived as horses, can be supported by analogy: thus the sun is certainly called a horse, and the mother of the Aśvins is, according

to an old, if not Rigvedic, tradition, called a mare. Beyond this we cannot go. The fact that the chariots are also borne by birds is of some interest: are we to see in this fact, as suggested in another connexion of the Dioskouroi by S. Reinach,1 a relic of a time when the Aśvins were regarded themselves as birds, and in special swans? It is clearly impossible to determine this with any security there is no trace of such a view in the Vedic literature, and to conjecture it into that literature is, therefore, illegitimate, since it is not necessary thus to explain the fact that the chariot of the gods is borne by birds. The connexion of the gods with Sürya presents difficulties in that it is not at all clear what Sürya represents: Mannhardt 2 suggests for her the Dawn, E. H. Meyer the goddess of the clouds, while Oldenberg thinks that Sürya means literally the sun-maiden as the feminine form of the sun, the alternative expression 'daughter of the sun ' being invented to remove the apparent in- consistency of the usage. It is difficult to feel any certainty as to this identi- fication the fact that Soma is said to marry the maiden does increase the probability that she is the sun, but the further fact that Püṣan also marries her makes the idea less likely. Ingenuity might also connect the legend of the victory of the Aśvins in a chariot race at the wedding of Surya to Soma as a trace of an older version, in which the Aśvins were able to win her hand by showing their superior swiftness to the other wooers in a chariot race, and this idea would carry us into the sphere of conceptions which are seen in the Indian Svayamvara, but common sense forbids us to combine priestly speculations in this manner.5 

## 7. The Goddess Dawn 

Usas the goddess is no small figure in the Rigveda: she is the subject of twenty hymns and is mentioned not less than 300 times in all, and the hymns addressed to her are among the most brilliant in the whole of the Samhită. The personification of the dawn is of the slightest description, and takes the form of picturing her as a maiden decked by her mother in gay attire, who reveals her bosom to mortal eyes. She is young, being born again and again,

• Rel. des Veda3, p. 213; von Schroeder (op. cit. ii. 414, n. 3) regards her as the young sun, who is renewed yearly and celebrates a fresh marriage. 

The legend of Pelops has, it is well known, of late led to the most remarkable speculations of annual victims, deter- mined as the result of races, by the Cambridge school of religion ; 

see 

Themis, pp. 220 ff. Usener (Götter- namen, pp. 228, 229) compares the wedding of Soma and Sûryā to that of Zeus and Here; see also von Schroeder, op. cit. ii. 302 ff. Hillebrandt (Vød. Myth. ii. 41 f.) strongly supports Sürya as Uṣas. The apparent polyandry of Sürya in myth, not the wedding hymn, is clearly not to be taken as a reflex of human usage despite von Schroeder (op. cit. ii. 402); cf. the con- nexion of the morning and evening stars with the twilights, Gray, Myth, of All Races, iii. 325. Different ideas may easily lie at the bottom of the myths.

and yet is ancient: she wastes away the life of mortals. She shines now, and shall shine in the future as in former days; she shines forth, shortening the days of men, the last of the days that have dawned, the first of those that have to come. Usas on her coming awakes to life men and animals: the birds fly up from their nest, and men seek their work. She illumines the ways, and drives away the spirits of darkness and evil: bad dreams she sends to Trita Aptya. She opens the gates of darkness as the cattle their stall, and she is called the mother of cattle. She is borne on a shining swift car drawn by steeds, or ruddy kine or bulls, perhaps the red rays of the light of morning rather than the red clouds of the morning: in a day she traverses thirty Yojanas. 

The Dawn stands in the closest relation to the sun, who follows her as a lover. She is the wife as well as the beloved of Sürya, but, as she precedes him as well as is followed by him, by another train of thought she appears as the mother of Sürya or yet again as created by him. She is also the sister of the Aditya Bhaga, the kinswoman of Varuna, and the sister, the greater sister, of night, from whom, however, she is also born, and who appears invoked jointly with her; both are mothers or wives of Sürya or Agni.1 Beyond all she is the daughter of Dyaus, and even once she appears as the beloved of heaven. With Agni she is closely connected, appearing before or with or after him as the fire lit for the morning sacrifice. She is the friend of the Aśvins and is born at the yoking of their car moreover, if she is Sūryä, she is also their wife. Once too, like Sürya, she is associated with the moon, which pre- cedes the dawns as the harbinger of day. Indra is said to have lighted up the dawn as is natural in the great finder of light, but once he appears as hostile and as shattering her car : 2 the myth is obscure, and has been variously inter- preted of the thunderstorm overwhelming the light of dawn, and as a victory of Indra bringing the sun over the dawn, which seeks to delay his advent. With the latter view may be compared the prayer that is once offered to her not to delay her coming, that the sun may not scorch her as a thief or an enemy. Normally, however, the Dawn never infringes the law of order: she goes straight along her path and never misses her way. She awakes the devout man to sacrifice, and is besought to let the niggard sleep on. But, by the usual inversion of ideas, she is sometimes represented as being awakened by the worshippers. To her worshipper she brings wealth, long life, renown, and glory, to her and to the sun the dead man is said to go,* and the Fathers are seated in the lap of the ruddy dawns.5

The Goddess Dawn 

121 

Throughout the conception of dawn there runs the multiplicity of the actual dawns on the one hand and the unity of the goddess on the other hand; the poet here and there inclines to treat each dawn as a separate being, but this tendency is over-crossed by the unity of the substance of the deity. She is, of course, the Aurora of Rome and the Eos of Greece, but the parallelism is no proof of an Indo-European cult, and the Teutonic Ostara and the Lettish Uhsing represent rather a worship of the young sun in the spring.1 

8 

It would, of course, be an error to suppose that these hymns to Dawn are generically different from the other Vedic hymns: they are not in the slightest degree inconsistent with the position which in the ritual the goddess has assigned her : she in the morning before the birds begin to sing is invoked with other deities, but receives no share in the Soma drink. On the other hand, while in much of the poetry there is, as a result in part of this fact, a freedom from connexion with the details of the offering, the priests were well aware of the value of the Dawn to them as brit ging the activity of the sacrifice, and ensuring them the largesse which they desired: hence it is not impossible that the epithet Dakṣiņā attributed in one passage to the goddess does directly identify her with the sacrificial fee, and reduce the dawn to the aspect of a valuable commercial asset.2 It would be wrong, therefore, to accept the view that the worship of Dawn died out as the Vedic Indians wandered further south-east, as was long ago suggested by Weber. On the other hand, it is clear that this worship must have had a commencement, and that too in some place where the phenomena of nature are such as to evoke the real poetry of the Vedic descriptions of dawn; that this must have been in the Punjab is all but certain. This fact alone would suggest the early date of the Ușas hymns, for the heart of the Rigveda was not, we may be certain, composed there, but rather in the later Kurukṣetra country south of Ambāla, where alone the phenomena, which are seen in the myth of Indra, appear in their full form. In these later seats of Vedic civilization the goddess continued to receive her meed of praise, and hymns based on the old were composed for her, but the worship of the goddess was never of importance in the ritual. Hillebrandt's " theory that the Dawn celebrated in the Rigveda is the first dawn of the new year, is wholly unsupported by any evidence, and depends on a theory of the Rigvedic view of the year which is arbitrary. He identifies dawn with the 

1 Usas's dance (RV. x. 29. 2) may be com- pared with the dance of the sun on Easter day in German and Slav mythology; von Schroeder, Arische Religion, ii. 51 ff. For Celtic parallels, see Rhys, Celtic Heathendom, pp. 299 f., 884 f., 456.

## 8. The Moon 

Apart from his connexion with Soma,2 the moon is not prominent in the Vedic literature, unless with Hillebrandt we recognize him under such guises as that of Bṛhaspati, Apāṁ Napāt, Varuņa, Yama, Narāśañsa, or Tvaṣtṛ, or Viśvarūpa. He appears rarely in conjunction with Surya in the compounds Süryāmāsā and Sūryācandramasă, but little is said of the pair beyond noting their alternate appearance, which is once attributed to Bṛhaspati, their creation by the creator, and the fact that they are the two bright eyes of Varuna. The birth of the moon from the sun is recognized, as well as its regular death. The connexion of the moon with the mind is early recorded," and may stand in relation to its connexion with the Fathers. In addition to the influence of the moon on vegetation, its connexion with the tides is recognized." The moon phases also receive some degree of worship, and the darkness in the face of the moon is accounted for in various ways.9 The Jaiminiya Brāhmaṇa 10 already records the existence in the moon of a hare, identified with Yama, whence the later name of Çaśin, a view corresponding to the occidental belief in the man in the moon. Among other identifications Prajapati appears once equated with Candramas, but the more normal view is found in the idea of the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa that from the asceticism of Prajapati there sprang up five beings, Agni, Vāyu, Aditya, Candramas, and Usas. Another passage tells that the first four of these deities made good the members of Prajapati when the work of creation exhausted him and he fell to pieces.11

The Moon

use of swinging has plausibly been regarded as unnatural as a sun rite, but easily explicable as one derived from the moon; the conception of the sun as a boat or a vessel stands in a similar relation, while in German mythology such Indian beliefs as the hare in the moon, and the ceremonial striking of the calves with a fresh twig to produce milk in connexion with the new and full moon offerings, appear transferred to the sun. The importance of the moon in early times as giving the means of measuring time is insisted upon, and even the connexion of the fish with fertility is traced to the apparent con- nexion of shape between the fish and the sickle of the moon. These con- jectures, fortunately, need not be seriously considered in regard to Vedic mythology; if they have any validity, they refer to a period distinctly earlier than the religion of the Veda.

It is probable in any case that the question is not one of the super- session of a moon mythology by a sun mythology, but of simple contamination. If we hear that in the highest step of Visņu there is the well of the mead,' it is not necessary to bring into connexion with this the Lettish legend of the foot- print of the horse in which Uhsing, god of the spring sun, brews beer, and to suggest that there was an Indo-European myth which saw in the marks on the moon the footprint of a steed, the conclusion ultimately being drawn that behind both Viṣņu and Uhsing we have a moon deity. The mead is from the heaven, Viṣņu's highest step is in the heaven; the combination of ideas is thoroughly in the spirit of the Vedic imagination. Or again Agni's flight into the waters, and assumption of animal forms therein, are easily enough explained from his character as the lightning from the clouds, and we are not really helped by the suggestion that the myth goes back to the loss of light when the moon disappears, the theriomorphic conception being due to the sickle shape of the moon which suggests a fish,3 naturally equated with the salmon form in which Loki evaded his pursuers, or even the Dolphin shape of Apollo. Agni, after all, is not conceived as a fish, and the imaginative efforts required to introduce the moon suggest that the whole suggestion of the im- portance of the moon is greatly exaggerated. The moon by its waxing and waning doubtless was of great importance in fixing times of offering, but in India at least it is difficult to see how fundamental importance could be attached to this figure in comparison with the vital energy of the sun. The ethnic evidence for the importance of the moon is valuable, but it is idle to suppose that every religion has developed on parallel lines and we may believe that Indo-European religion, owing perhaps to the place of its development, was less than some others inclined to make much of the moon.
