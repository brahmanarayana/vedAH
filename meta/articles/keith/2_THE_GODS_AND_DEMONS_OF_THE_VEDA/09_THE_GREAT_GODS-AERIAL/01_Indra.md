INDRA is the greatest god of the Rigveda, with the solitary exception of Varuna, who may be deemed to equal him in might.1 His connexion with the Soma offering is, however, far closer than that of Varuṇa; he is the subject of 250 hymns, or almost a quarter of the whole of the collection, and he shares with other deities at least fifty more. He is, however, like Varuṇa in one thing he is not a god whose physical nature overwhelms the anthropo- morphism of the poets: he has, therefore, become the subject of many myths, which it would be idle to seek to bring into any connexion whatever with the normal basis of his nature. 

Of the personal appearance of Indra a much more vivid picture is given than of any other of the gods: he has head, arms, hands, and a great belly which he fills full with the Soma, so that it comes to be likened to a lake. His lips are often mentioned: his beard is agitated when he moves, and, like his hair, it is tawny; his arms are long and strong, as becomes the wielder of the bolt, and he can assume any form at will. His favourite weapon is the thunderbolt,2 of metal or of gold, with four or a hundred angles, with a hundred or a thousand points. His is par excellence the epithet vajrin, 'bearer of the bolt', which is else given but once each to Rudra, the Maruts, and Manyu. When he bears a bow, his arrows are hundred-pointed and winged with a thousand feathers. He has also a hook with which he gives wealth or fights, and the Atharvaveda 3 gives him a net wherewith to over- come his foes. His chariot is drawn by horses, normally two, but sometimes a thousand or eleven hundred: their hair is like peacock's feathers. His favourite food is the Soma, which he drinks on the very day of his birth, and of which he consumed three lakes when seeking to slay Vṛtra: on yet another occasion he drank thirty lakes. The epithet Soma-drinker is so essentially his that it is given only to Vayu apart from him, and a few times to Bṛhaspati and Agni, when associated with him. His connexion with Vāyu in this regard is close he is said to have Indra for his charioteer. Indra, however, also drinks milk mixed with honey, and is partial to buffaloes, eating as many as

The birth of Indra is mysterious, like that of other heroes; he declines to be born save through his mother's side: this may be interpreted as the lightning bursting through the cloud, or it may be merely treated as one of the many cases of miraculous births, which may be ascribed to nothing more than popular fancy, and of which the birth of Athene is on one view a famous case. His mother is called once a cow, and he is styled a calf: once she is called Niṣtigri, identified by Sāyaṇa with Aditi. Twice she is styled Śavasī, as he is the son of strength (śavas). The Atharvaveda makes her Ekāṣṭakā, daughter of Prajapati; which is of course merely speculation. His father is Tvaṣtṛ or Dyaus, and a legend clearly indicates that, in order to obtain the Soma, he seized his father by the foot and slew him: perhaps for this reason we find one clear record of the hostility of the gods to Indra. Only late speculation makes him the oldest, or the favourite, son of Prajapati, while with Agni he springs from the mouth of the giant in the Puruṣasūkta. Agni and Pûṣan are made his brothers, and his sons once occur, but without indication who they are; he has, however, a son Kutsa, produced from his thigh and precisely like him, in the Jaiminiya. His wife is Indrāṇī, but the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa gives him two wives, Senā and Prāsahā, who are clearly legendary; the regular post-Vedic wife, Śaci, daughter of Puloman, is clearly derived from his epithet śacipati, ‘lord of strength', understood as husband of Śaci, a meaning which Pischel * vainly reads into the Rigveda. She definitely appears in the Jaiminiya Brāhmaṇa in a curious legend in which Kutsa Aurava, born of Indra's thigh and his double, lies with her and is marked by Indra to distin- guish him. But another tale alluded to in the Atharvaveda 10 tells how in love of an Asura woman, the Dānavi Vilisteñgā," he went to live among the Asuras, assuming a female form among women, a male among men. Here perhaps should be reckoned his invocation as Menā,' wife' or ' daughter' of Vṛṣaṇaśva in the Subrahmaṇya.12 A vulgar tale 18 records how, as Sumitra, he had

intercourse with Dirghajihvi, an Asura woman, who licked the Soma and had unlimited organs of sex. 

Of the other gods Indra is closely connected with his troop, the Maruts, with Agni whom he generates or finds in the waters, and to whom he is akin in nature, (with Varuna, Vayu, Soma, Bṛhaspati, Puṣan, and Visṇu, whose relation to him becomes in some passages a close one. With Surya he is actually here and there identified, he receives the epithet Savitṛ, and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa1 declares him to be the sun and Vṛtra the moon. But he differs from all the gods in his physical magnitude which makes the two worlds but half of him, heaven and earth insufficient for his girdle, and ten earths not equal to him. (No language is too strong for the Vedic poets in expressing his greatness: Sūrya and Varuṇa are made inferior to him, he is invoked to destroy the foes of Varuna, Mitra, Aryaman, he makes broad space for the gods in battle he is an independent ruler par excellence, and occasionally, like Varuṇa, a universal ruler. He is the mighty (śakra), an epithet rarely used of any other god. He practically alone is styled of a hundred powers' (śatakratu); he is strong, young, immortal, and ancient) 

: 

There is nothing here to show clearly the nature of Indra, save in so far as his connexion with the sun and the fire suggests his fiery character, and that with Vayu his fierce onset. But the myth of the slaying of Vṛtra, which is the great deed of the god, is not doubtful in sense. It takes the form of the slaying by the god with the aid of the Maruts and of Visṇu, or without their aid, of a serpent which was lying on the mountains keeping in with its coils the waters of the streams. The flood of the waters flows then swiftly to the sea, and at the same time the light shines forth. The god strikes Vṛtra on the back, or smites his face, or pierces his vital parts. But the action is not done once, but ever and again, and Indra is implored to perform it in the future as in the past. The waters set free are likened often to lowing cows, and such is the fury of the onset that the heaven and earth tremble with fear. It is important to note that the terms used of the myth are essentially restricted with very rare exceptions to the words, bolt, mountain, waters, or rivers, in place of lightning, clouds, and air. The cows which occur here and there are open to two interpretations; they may be simply the waters, for in a few cases the waters are clearly so designated, as when it is said that the cows roared at the birth of Indra. But they may also be the rays of light, set free when the waters are loosened. 

2 

In the view of Oldenberg the use of the terms mountain and streams is proof that in the Vedic period the poets conceived the deed of Indra as the setting forth from mountains on earth of streams terrestrial, the invaluable 

a yoke on his shoulders, supporting a basket of cakes and a pot of curds and butter, to Upamā, wife of Kṣatra, a presage of victory in battle; JB. iii. 244 IT.

waters of the Punjab: he grants that in the oldest period the myth was one of the thunderstorm, the fall of rain, and the coming of the light.1 But, while he admits that this view of the myth was perfectly well known to Yaska and to the later literature, he denies that it was appreciated by the Vedic poets. This is, however, difficult to accept: the arguments adduced for it are not by any means conclusive. The absence of direct mention normally-occasionally there is such mention as Oldenberg admits-is due to the fact that the story is a myth; it has passed the stage when it is merely a description of phenomenon, and it is not only a myth but a very popular myth. Moreover, it is impossible to accept the view that Vajra, the name of the bolt, is not the thunderbolt, which it is throughout the Vedic literature, often in quite clear fashion. The comparison of mountains with clouds is natural and easy: the mountains are the clouds, which before the storm hang in heavy darkness refusing to yield the rain: the storm comes, the lightning bursts forth, the rain falls, and the sun shines out. A different view is suggeste 1 by the theory of Hillebrandt which sees in the story of the contest with Vṛtra, not the storm-god bringing down the rain to earth, but the defeating of a serpent demon, the glacier which with the winter cold holds fast the waters in ice. The suggestion is brilliant and attractive, and, if such a glacial myth existed, it would clearly be natural to find its remnants in the tale of Vṛtra, but the evidence which can be adduced from the language of the Rigveda is of the most inadequate nature to prove the thesis desired. 

The slaying of Vṛtra is not merely attributed to Indra: by the syncretism of the Veda, it is also attributed to Agni and Soma. The gods as a whole are supposed to aid Indra in the contest, but at the roaring or hissing of the serpent they fled, leaving the Maruts only to aid him, and once at least even they fled, and left him alone. Viṣṇu is also an aider in the struggle and even earthly priests lend aid. 

Another myth tells of the slaying of the three-headed Viśvarupa by Indra: 4 it is, however, clear that this is a more modern form of a myth in which Viśvarupa was slain by Trita, for this form of the myth appears in the Rigveda, and in the Avesta Thraëtaona is said to slay a three-headed serpent with six eyes, freeing thus two fair ladies. In the classical myths of Herakles and Geryoneus, and of Hercules and Cacus, the monsters have likewise three heads, and, when slain, the hero wins the cattle which they have taken and

hidden away. The motive of winning cows is found also in the Viśvarūpa myth, and it is perfectly clear that these four myths are one and the same in nature: in the case of the Avesta the part of restoring lost cattle has past over to Ahura himself, who is par excellence the discoverer of lost things. 

With this myth may be compared the legend 1 of Saramā and the Paṇis. The Panis stole and hid away cows in a cave among the rocks, and Indra's dog, Saramā, pursues them and finds the place where are the cows: them she demands back from the Panis in a dialogue which is preserved to us in an interesting, if not very old, hymn of the Rigveda. The Panis refuse to give them back and the later tradition makes Saramā unfaithful to her mission. This, however, is not recorded in the Rigveda, and from other accounts it seems that Indra advances against the Panis and recovers the cows. More- over, we find Bṛhaspati engaged in the same feat: the priestly god with his prayers cleaves the barriers behind which the cows are hidden, and brings them forth. Agni too takes a share in the struggle: the priestly god of fire is naturally active in this important undertaking. The Añgirases also take a great part, or, in their place, the seven seers, the eponymous fathers of the priestly clans. They pray and they offer sacrifice, and thus attain the same end. A further element in the picture of Vala: Indra cleaves his ridge in attaining the cows. The meaning of the myth can hardly be doubtful when it is noted how often Indra is brought into prominence as the maker of the dawn and the finder of the sun. The cows must be, not rain-clouds, as some- times in the myth of Vṛtra, but the morning beams of light, or perhaps the red clouds of dawn; there is little difference between the two conceptions. The nature of Vala,' the Keeper', is clearer still: he is merely the personifica- tion of the place in which the cows are kept. But the Papis are not quite so easy to explain: Hillebrandt2 has found in them an historical people, and has argued that the mention of the Panis is a piece of history turned into myth. It is perfectly possible that this could be the case, but in the case of the Panis, who are assimilated to Parnians, the references are not satisfactorily taken as historical in ultimate essence: the theory too involves speculations regarding the places in which the Rigveda was composed which will not stand very close investigation. The natural and satisfactory view is that the Panis were the misers, who refuse to give the priests gifts, and who are overthrown, a con- ception which is interwoven with the mythical winning of the clouds. 

A further question, however, arises as to the exact circumstances in which 

1 RV. x. 108. Oldenberg (Rel. des Veda', 

p. 147) treats the legend as an aetio- logical myth to explain men's owner- ship of cows. A similar view of the waters myth is also unlikely. Rhys (Celtic Heathendom, pp. 299 ff.) holds him a culture hero, but admits con- tamination with Trita or Dyaus.

in Saramā, and sun and moon in the Sārameyas, and SO with Saranyū (ii. 48-50).

the clouds are won. Is it to be supposed that the legend is only another side of the winning of the light in the Vṛtra legend, which means, no doubt, the appearance of light after the thunderstorm? The answer to this question is usually given in the affirmative, but it seems much more likely that the myth is an independent one, the winning of the sun and the dawn from the dark mountains of the night, as is the view of Oldenberg. To suppose that this is a secondary development from the other myth is not necessary, nor very probable. But it is impossible to follow Oldenberg in the view that the winning of the light and the sun, which is connected with the Vṛtra myth, is not an expression of the recovery of the light after the storm, but a poetical embellishment of the theme. 

While it is in these mythical forms that the feats of Indra as bringing down the rain and finding the light are mainly celebrated, there are passages in which he is credited with creating the lightnings and turning the waters of heaven downwards, and very much more f  ́eely is his feat of winning the dawn and the sun celebrated. Such a god was clearly essentially suited to be the god of the warrior, and Indra is the great aider of the Vedic Indian, the Aryan, in his fights, whether with other Aryan foes, or more often in the tradition with the Dāsas or Dasyus, in whom we must often see the aborigines. It would be wholly impossible to believe that in every case the Dāsas are human enemies, and they include doubtless evil spirits who are none other than the gods of the hated races: twice in the Rigveda 1 we find phallus wor- shippers regarded as hostile, and everything points to the probability of such deities being among the enemies overthrown by Indra in the Rigveda. But, equally obviously, historical men may be reckoned as among the foes of the gods, and invested with traits of demons. Or again they may simply be men- tioned as defeated by Indra, as princes whom we have no reason to doubt as Aryan are represented as being defeated for another prince by the aid of the god, as when for Tūrvayāṇa, Ayu, Atithigva, and Kutsa are overthrown. 

The hostile Dāsas or Dasyus are regarded as black skinned 2 and noseless, doubtless a reference to flat noses, but their chief characteristic, and the one which makes them no real men, is their refusal to worship the Aryan gods, and to give gifts to the priest, the two essential duties of the true Vedic warrior. Of the princes favoured by Indra the greatest, or one of the greatest, is Atithigva or Divodāsa, ' the servant of the heaven', whose name has wrongly induced Hillebrandt to treat him as a Dāsa and to find the Dāsas among the Dahae, instead of among the aborigines of India itself. Among his foes are men with names like Karañja and Parnaya, whose appellations seem very possibly aboriginal, and above all Śambara. That foe has forts, ninety or ninety-nine,

or a hundred, and with the aid of Indra he destroys them and defeats him in his home in the mountains. Mythical these references may of course be, and clouds be meant, but it is quite as easy to see in them the real palisades of the aborigines stormed by Aryan princes, and their pursuing their enemy to the hills in which as always the defeated forces from the plains take refuge. Śambara is also defeated by Indra for the sake of Ṛjiśvan, son of Vidathin. He also lulls to slumber and to ruin Cumuri and Dhuni for the sake of Dabhiti, and this reference may not inaptly be applied to an attack on the enemy made by night when the camp was wrapped in slumber.1 Another foe overcome by Indra is Ilibiśa: his name like that of Pipru and of other of Indra's foes seems un-Aryan. 

4 

In other cases there may be a more mythic basis. The demon Urana is described as having ninety-nine arms which is rather inhuman: 2 Arbuda is so little specified as to be of doubtful origin. Śuṣṇa seems from his name to be the hisser,3 in which case he would have analogies with Vṛtra, whose snorting (śvasatha) so frightens the gods that they run away, leaving Indra to fight alone with the monster. He is also called a wild beast and he seems to be horned, which may of course merely refer to the head-dress of a chief of the aborigines. His chief rival is Kutsa, who appears as battling against him, and as victor by the aid of Indra, who for his sake tore from the sun a wheel, pro- longing the daylight and thus enabling, it may be assumed, Kutsa to turn the issue of battle. The feat of Indra is several times mentioned, and the fact that Kutsa is a real hero is suggested, though not proved, by the fact that elsewhere he appears in hostile relation to Indra, just as Atithigva, who is normally the protégé of Indra, in one or two places appears in the reverse relation. It is true that it is not to be expected that a god, or a hero of divine dimensions, would be thus placed in opposition to the god, though, as the god is the uncertain Indra, the argument is by no means conclusive. Kutsa in the case of his real personality must be a king, and this is not inconsistent with his being called a seer royal seers are not unknown. The Jaiminiya Brāhmaṇa makes him born from Indra's thigh and disloyal to him. No other god has anything like the same place as Indra in the overcoming of the Dasas for the sake of the Aryans: the feat is ascribed elsewhere only to Agni, the Aśvins, and the gods generally.

seems, made a compact with him not to slay him by any weapon, by wet or dry, by day or night, and, true to this compact, when he did slay him it was with the foam of the sea at the twilight on the margin of the sea, and the head, struck off, follows him, reproaching him with treachery. The story is especially interesting because of its clear reference to the idea of the external soul: doubtless that of Namuci was deemed to be placed in the sea foam. Note- worthy also is Indra's consciousness of guilt in slaying.1 A further curious tale tells how Indra as the result of over-indulgence in his favourite Soma became ill, and how he was cured by drinking with Namuci, or by extracting in some way from his body, a curious mixture of Soma and Surā. The Sautrā- maṇi rite of the Brāhmaṇas is clearly a case of a rite founded on the strange and unedifying myth. In the Rigveda Indra twists off the head of Namuci, which suggests the natural phenomenon of a waterspout amidst a storm. 

The Asuras also are more probably to be taken as the powers of darkness than as men, though individual Asuras may be quite well nothing but men : thus Pipru is called a Dāsa, and also an Asura, and the Asura Varcin, whose hundred and thousand men are slain by Indra and Viṣṇu when they over- throw Śambara, may fall in the same category. As we have seen, the Asuras appear but seldom as foes in the Rigveda; in one hymn, however, we learn that Agni abandons the Asuras, and joins the gods, that Indra slays Vṛtra, and that the wiles of the Asuras depart from them. In the Brāhmaṇa literature Indra of course, like the other gods, fights against the Asuras, and after the usual period of defeat succeeds in defeating them in turn by the adoption of some ritual device or the repetition of some formula."

In some cases we have full evidence of historical happenings. Turvaśa and Yadu, that is the kings of the two tribes of that time, in whose historical character we have no ground to doubt," are declared to have been brought safely over the stream by Indra's aid, doubtless procured by the help of the priest, and he is the great god who assists Sudas at the instance of Vasiṣṭha * in the battle with the ten kings, and makes him overthrow his rivals, bringing them to death in the stream of the Paruṣṇī, and then assisting the king to overthrow Bheda. Similar is the statement that he aided Suśravas and slew 60,099 of his enemies, though the number is fabulous. It is he on whom men

The Gods and Demons of the Veda 

[Part II 

call in battle, and, little as the Vedic poetry is inspired with warlike spirit, here and there it is clear that the poet has caught some of the tone of war poetry.1 Doubtless part of the lavishing of wealth which is a merit of Indra's was manifested in the giving of victory in the strife for cows, which, as the chief form of property of primitive Indian society, made up the main object to be won in a mere foray. Indra too appears in close relations with his worshippers, as a friend, a brother, a father or father and mother in one. The epithet Kauśika denotes him as the family god of the Kuśikas. He is the generous god par excellence, whence the title Maghavan, bountiful, is almost exclusively his in the Vedic ritual literature, and is his common name in post-Vedic texts. His bounty includes wives and also children. 

In other cases myths are attached to Indra, in which we need not seek any direct connexion with his nature: as a great god he can stretch out heaven and earth, and in particular he settles the quaking mountains, while in the later Vedic texts he is said to have cut off the wings of the mountains and to have reduced them to a stationary condition. The wings then became the thunder clouds. The separation of heaven and earth is sometimes attributed to his victory over a demon, who held them together: the faint parallelism with the Hesiodic myth * is hardly worth note. If anything more than imagination is to be seen in the idea, it may be that the light appearing seems to separate the heaven and earth joined by the darkness. Probably, too, we must not see any reference to the myth of Vṛtra is the oft repeated wonder of the poet that Indra places in the red or raw cow the cooked milk. The problem seems to have been a favourite one in India. A less satisfactory side of his character is revealed in his addition to the drinking of Soma: a curious, if late, hymn 5 is represented as the monologue of the drunken Indra, who sees himself able to do anything he likes in the intoxication produced by his deep draughts. His over-indulgence in the drink has been noted, and it was his desire for it which drove him to slay his father. He is also the hero of more than one amour; an old litany, the Subrahmaṇyā, addresses him as the lover of Ahalya, a Brahman, calling himself Gautama, from which the Brahmaṇas derive the natural explanation that he approached Ahalya, wife of Gautama, under her husband's name and form. To Weber the episode denotes that the dawn of morning ascends the bright sky, but their loving commerce is broken by the cloud coming up, but it would be unwise to press the accuracy of such an explanation. It may be rather ranked with the many aetiological myths of

Indra

different countries in which a family claims divine descent through the inter- course of a god with an ancestress, whose honour is saved by the representa- tion that the god approached her in the guise of her lawful spouse. A still more obscure story 1 tells how a maiden, Apālā, found Soma beside a river, and having pressed it dedicated it to Indra, from whom she received the fulfilment of certain desires. Yet more obscure if possible is the famous Vṛṣākapi hymn, which narrates a dispute which arose between Indra and Indrāṇī over an ape, Vṛṣākapi, which was the dear friend of Indra, but which had aroused the anger of Indrāṇi by destroying some of her property. Vṛṣākapi is in- duced, despite his caution, to be caught by Indrāṇī and is beaten by Indra, and banished from the house. Indra, however, misses his companion, and in some way not intelligible a reconciliation is effected. It would be idle to seek mythological conceptions in this strange confusion of ideas, and von Bradke 3 has ingeniously suggested that the hymn is none other than a satire on a con- temporary prince and his consort under th titles of the god and goddess. The problem is plainly insoluble. Another odd tale is that of his stealing Aiṣakṛta Śitibāhu's Soma in monkey form, this power of change of shape adhering to him in later tradition, where he appears as a leech, parrot, or cat. 

Nothing is more interesting in Indra's nature than the contrast between the strongly moral character of his rival Varuna and his own lack of moral quality. He is occasionally given moral attributes, and faith in him is enjoined, but the very fact that the existence of sceptics who denied his divinity is recorded shows that the nature of Indra was not in all quarters considered to be worthy of the conception of divinity, doubtless as compared with the figure of Varuṇa. A list of his sins includes the killing of Viśva- rūpa, Vṛtra, the Arurmaghas, and the Yatis, and quarrelling with Bṛhaspati, to whom priestly partiality is shown.5

The existence of Indra in the period of Indo-Iranian unity, which was rendered probable by the existence of a demon Indra, and of the god of victory Verethraghna, who is clearly equivalent to Vṛtrahan, is made practically certain by the discovery of the name of Indra along with those of Mitra and Varuna and the Nāsatya among the gods of the Mitanni. While the name is of quite uncertain origin,' the parallelism of the myth of the finding of the cows proves that part of the conception of the god is Indo-European.
