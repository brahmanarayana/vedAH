Ahi Budhnya, 'the serpent of the deep', is closely associated in the few cases, twelve in all, in which his name is found in the Rigveda with the gods Aja Ekapād, Apāṁ Napāt, the ocean, and Savitṛ. His name never occurs save in the hymns to the All-gods, and there it is regularly found among the spirits of the atmosphere, and in the Naighaṇṭuka ' he is definitely assigned to the middle or aerial region. The only definite traits ascribed to him are that he is born of the waters, sitting at the bottom of the streams in the spaces, language which the normal spirit of the Rigveda no less than the express assertion of Yāska & induces us to refer to the ocean of the air, and not to the earthly waters. His dangerous character is hinted at by the fact that he is implored not to give over his worshippers to evil.

The explanation of the nature of this spirit is by no means obvious. The serpent par excellence of the Vedic poets is Vṛtra, who encloses the waters, but also is described as lying upon them, or in the depth of the waters. Agni, however, is also described as a raging serpent and is said to have been produced in the depth (budhna) of the great space. To Hardy 10 the god is another form of the moon, to Oldenberg 11 a water snake, and Macdonell 12 suggests that he is really a form of Ahi-Vṛtra regarded as divine, and not as merely an enemy

of Indra. More vaguely it may be thought that the god is nothing more than a personification of the writhing cloud, whose serpentine form is a simple enough conception; the difference between this conception and that of Vṛtra would lie in the fact that the latter conception applies to the thunder clouds rather than to the mere clouds of the sky. The prayer for safety from harm would be natural enough addressed to a deity conceived in serpent form. It is, however, also possible that the god is merely another form of Agni; in the later Vedic texts the god is connected with Agni Gārhapatya,1 and with Aja Ekapad he receives a formal share in the offering at a Gṛhya ceremony, from which, however, it would doubtless be wrong to deduce that he was then a living deity. Such a deity he cannot have been for even the earliest period of the Rigveda, and the occasional mention of these gods even in the latest texts is testimony not to the life of the god but to the commanding influence of the Rigveda. In the post-Vedic literature the name survives as an epithet of Śiva and the name of a Rudra.

Aja Ekapād, 'the one-footed goat', is mentioned five times with Ahi Budhnya, and but once alone. The deities with whom he is mentioned are the ocean, the stream, the aerial space, the thundering flood, and all the gods, and his aerial connexion seems clear despite the preference for the celestial region evinced by the Naighanṭuka. In the later literature he appears as making firm the two worlds, according to the Atharvaveda, and as born in the east according to the Taittiriya Brāhmaṇa," and in the domestic ritual he is once joined with Ahi Budhnya. Native tradition, but only at a very late date, makes him out to be a form of Agni or the sun.®

It is difficult from these scanty facts to make anything out as to the nature of the god Roth' taking Aja, not as 'goat' which is its proper sense, but literally as driver', saw in him the storm; Bergaigne, rendering Aja as unborn', thinks he is a mysterious deity of the isolated world; Hardy finds in him as usual the moon; Victor Henry 1o and Bloomfield 11 the sun, while Macdonell 12 suggests the interesting, and, so far as the evidence allows, satisfactory, hypothesis that the lightning form of Agni is meant, the goat denoting his swift coming, and the one foot the solitary streak which smites the earth. This view is clearly preferable to that of Oldenberg, 13 which sees in the figure the myth of a goat which holds apart the worlds, an idea which has no adequate support in the reference in the Atharvaveda.
