## 1. The Dual Deities 

THE type of the dual deities, who form quite a marked feature of the Rigveda in which some sixty hymns are addressed to such gods, is given by the pair Dyāvāpṛthivi, heaven and earth, the primeval parents. The two individual gods are comparatively little mentioned in comparison with the pair: Dyaus has no hymn, Pṛthivi one only, and the pair have six. Other names are Dyāvākṣāmā, Dyāvābhūmi or Rodasi, in which the male character of Dyaus, never perfectly established, has yielded to the prevailing femininity of Pṛthivi. The pair are two fathers, two mothers. They are the makers of all creatures, but also they are made by many individual gods, Indra, Viśvakar- man, Tvaṣtṛ, or even produced from the sacrifice of the giant Purușa. One is a bull, the other a cow: they are unaging, they grant wealth, and are also wise and promote righteousness. They are also conceived as coming to the sacrifice or taking the sacrifice to the gods, but they are not of much importance in the ritual.1 They have, however, a hymn addressed to them in the Vaiśvadeva Çastra of the Agniṣṭoma, and an offering is made to them by the plougher, with the result that Parjanya sends him rain. The priests liken the two to the oblation holders or the earth to the altar, and the sky to the sacrificial fee.2

Mitra and Varuna have twenty-three hymns addressed to them as dual deities: the mythology is practically all borrowed from that of Varuna, and the chief point of interest is that the same phenomenon of double invocation can be seen in this case already in the Avesta. The priority of Mitra in the compound name has been argued 3 to indicate the superior importance at one time of that god, but the order accords also with the preference of the language for the placing of the shorter word in such a compound in the first place.1

With Indra Varuņa shares nine hymns: the characteristics of both gods are ascribed to the pair, but also they are found with the warlike deeds given to Indra, and Varuņa's wisdom is celebrated. Indra appears with Agni in eleven hymns, as sharing in the Soma, as slayers of Vṛtra and the Dāsas, and also as skilled priests and offerers: once they are called-presumably because of their close connexion with each other—the Aśvins. Indra and Vāyu are seven times invoked in hymns together, and practically always in connexion

with the drinking of the Soma; the same feature is to be found in the two hymns given to Indra and Bṛhaspati. Indra and Soma have two hymns: the deeds attributed are those of Indra. Indra and Püșan in their one hymn are described as the one drinking Soma, the other eating gruel or mush: else- where mention is made of their abode, to which the goat convoys the steed at the horse sacrifice. With Visņu, Indra in one hymn divides Soma-drinking and wide-stepping. 

Soma shares one hymn each with Puṣan, Rudra, and Agni. For Soma and Püṣan, Agni is invoked to put the ripe milk in the raw cows: Soma and Rudra are asked to set free from the fetter of Varuņa. Agni and Soma are said to have released the stream, obtained the light: one is brought from heaven by Matariśvan, the other by the eagle from the rock. Except in this one hymn they appear only twice as a pair in the whole of the Rigveda, showing that the close connexion which existed in the ritual and in the later Samhitās was not primitive. They appear several times in the Atharvaveda, and still oftener in the Yajurveda, where they are called the two eyes, or brothers, the sun being ascribed to Agni, the moon to Soma. In the ritual the victim which is offered before the main portion of the rite, or in the rite itself, is offered to Agni and Soma, and they also receive cakes, but not a share in the Soma, which certainly suggests that the Soma ritual had been fairly definitely settled before they were united as a joint deity.

In isolated verses a few more pairs occur, Agni and Parjanya as pro- ducing the oblation and offspring respectively, and apparently as connected with Dyaus, Parjanya, and Vata. Dawn and Night appear as sisters, daughters of Dyaus, mothers of order, weaving the web of sacrifice, and the sun and moon appear as Sūryāmāsā or Süryäcandramasă, who are little personified, but who are doubtless meant by the two bright eyes of Varuna or the two eyes of heaven. 

## 2. Groups of Gods 

It is a characteristic trait of the Rigveda that some forty hymns are de- voted to the group of gods called All-gods, Viśve Devās, and the impression given by the Rigveda is borne out by the ritual in which the All-gods receive frequent attention.2 The fact must be carefully borne in mind in framing any theory as to the feeling of the poets as to the rank of the several gods: they must have known of these joint invocations, in which as many gods as possible are propitiated, and the same tendency to be catholic in the reverence

recting Hillebrandt, Ved. Myth. i. 461 ; that they denote sun and moon is as improbable as that Indra and Agni are sun and moon. The connexion may be due to a Gautama (cf. RV. i. 98). The two gods were naturally enough con- nected as sacrificial, and hence the 

animal victim preceding the Soma offer- ing is given to them. 

• Arbman (Rudra, p. 154, n. 3) suggests that the term includes all the gods as opposed to the heavenly gods of the Vedic sacrifice; but this clearly is wrong, the term denoting the whole of the gods of the sacrifice taken collectively.

The Gods and Demons of the Veda 

[Part II 

paid to the gods is to be noted in the Sutras where offerings are prescribed to all the gods, including even unknown gods. The Rigveda already shows the tendency to set up individual gods as outside the number of All-gods: in the Sūtras there is perfectly obvious the distinction between all the gods and the older All-gods.1 The religious conception which lies at the back of it is one which can be paralleled from many religions. By inventing a comprehensive group no deity at any rate could justly complain that it had been passed over altogether. 

Of the other groups of gods the Maruts are the most important: they also in the Rigveda bear the name of Rudras. This group is, however, distin- guished from the Maruts in the later texts, and its number is placed at 11, though 88, which is the traditional number of all the gods, is given in the Taittiriya Samhita." The Adityas, who are seven or eight in the Rigveda, become 12 in the Brāhmaṇas, and are often mentioned especially in contrast with the Añgirases, who are rather a priestly family than actual deities. With the Adityas and Rudras the Vasus are invoked in the Rigveda : it is clear that there they are connected with Indra. But in the later texts they are connected with Agni, not Indra, and their number, not defined in the Rigveda, is fixed at 8, though the Taittirīya Saṁhitā,” by a freak gives 838. In the Chandogya Upanisad * we find five groups, Indra with the Rudras, Agni with the Vasus, Varuņa with the Adityas, Soma with the Maruts, and Brahman with the Sādhyas. The last group is a set of gods of whom practically nothing can be said they are mentioned occasionally from the Rigveda 7 onwards, occurring in the usual way even in the Sūtras, but except that they are ancient, nothing more is to be learned of their nature.8
