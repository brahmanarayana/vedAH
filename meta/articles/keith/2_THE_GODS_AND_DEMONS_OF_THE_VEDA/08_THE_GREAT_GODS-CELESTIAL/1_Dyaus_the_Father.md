DYAUS has the honour of being the only Indo-European god who is certainly to be recognized as having existed in the earliest period, and he has been claimed for that time as a real sovereign of the gods, much as Zeus among the Greeks. For this view there is clearly no cogent evidence available, though equally there is no cogent evidence to the contrary, for the fact that Dyaus is not a great god in India may be di e to decline in greatness, not to the absence of such greatness originally. In the Rigveda he has not a single hymn of his own, and his appearance is nearly always in one or other of two capacities: either he is the parent, who has as children Uṣas, the Aśvins, Agni, Parjanya. Surya, the Adityas, the Maruts, and the Añgirases, or he is coupled with the earth, Pṛthivĩ, or at least mentioned with other deities of whom Pṛthivi is normally one2; the legend of the union and separation of the two is often referred to, but without detail. Where he stands alone, he is mentioned as father of Indra, of Agni, as a father, as rich in seed, as a red bull which bellows downward, or, by another theriomorphic idea, as a black steed decked with pearls, an obvious allusion to the midnight sky. He smiles through the clouds, a trait which can only refer to the lightening sky, and an incipient anthropomorphism appears in the statement that he holds the bolt. With Pṛthivi he shares six hymns, but they have little force or significance; of more interest is the fact that sky and earth are called the two mothers, and that not rarely the word dyaus is feminine, a fact which shows that much weight cannot be laid on the contrast between male and female, stress upon which as a principle of Vedic religion has been laid by Bergaigne. With the higher life of the community Dyaus has little to do; he bears the usual title of the great gods, Asura, and with earth he is asked to avert sin committed against the gods or a friend or the head of the clan, but this is merely an application to the god of a commonplace prayer. The Vedic evidence 

1 von Bradke, Dyaus Asura; von Schroeder, Arische Religion, i. 299 ff. Moulton (Early Zoroastrianism, pp. 391-3) finds this god expressly recorded by his South Indo-European name in Hero- dotos, i. 131, but not very plausibly. Contrast Helm, Altgerm. Rel. i. 272; Rhys, Celtic Heathendom, pp. 109 f. 

* The two receive a good deal of attention in the ritual; Hillebrandt, Ved. Myth. 

iii. 397.

› Hopkins, Rel, of India, pp. 48, 59. The idea has been revived in K. J. Johan- sson, Ueber die altind. Göttin Dhiṣaṇā (1919), but see Oldenberg, GGA. 1919, pp. 357 ff. 

The theory of the ghost origin of Dyaus (Feist, Kultur der Indogermanen, pp. 339 ff.) is wholly improbable and quite contrary to the Veda.96

is, it should be noted, clearly opposed to the view of Warde Fowler,1 which does not recognize physical paternity as the primitive sense of pater in religion.2
