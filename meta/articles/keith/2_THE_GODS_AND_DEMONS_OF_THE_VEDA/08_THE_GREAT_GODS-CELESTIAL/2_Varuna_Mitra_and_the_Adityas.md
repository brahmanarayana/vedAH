The slight prominence of Dyaus in the Indian period is doubtless in part at least due to the prominence of Mitra and Varuṇa, of which pair the greatest by far is Varuna. Mitra, indeed, by his close association with Varuna has lost any real independence of character. Though Varuna is anthropomorphic and has arms, hands, feet, walks, drives, sits, eats, and drinks, the cosmic character of his eye is brought very clearly: the eye of Mitra and Varuna is repeatedly declared to be the sun, and it figures conspicuously in all the hymns regarding Varuṇa. Varuṇa is also far-sighted and thousand-eyed: he wears a golden mantle and a shining robe. He and Mitra drive with the rays of the sun as with arms, and like Savitṛ and Tvastṛ they are beautiful handed. In striking contrast with this picture of a fair god is that suggested by a passage in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, where Varuṇa is described as a bald yellow-eyed old man; but this passage must be read in its context, from which it appears clearly that we have to deal not with a primitive, but with a mystical, view of the nature of Varuṇa. 

3 

Like other gods, Mitra and Varuṇa have a chariot which they mount in the highest heaven, and in heaven is their golden abode, which is lofty with a thousand columns and a thousand doors. To that palace resorts the all-seeing sun to report to Varuṇa the deeds of men: in it the Fathers behold him, and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa represents Varuṇa as seated in the midst of heaven, gazing upon the places of punishment around him. 

4 

With Mitra, or alone, Varuṇa is often styled a king; he is king of both gods and men, of all that exists, of the whole world. He bears also the title of independent ruler (svarāj) which is more specially Indra's, and, much oftener than Indra, he is called universal monarch (samrāj), a title found a few times also of Agni. With Mitra and twice also with Aryaman, he is accorded the attribute of sovereignty (kṣatra) which is elsewhere given but once each to Agni, Bṛhaspati, and the Aśvins; similarly the term ruler is given to him in four of its five occurrences, and but once to the gods in general. He and Mitra are the noble lords of the gods, and the epithet Asura is given to him in proportion far oftener than to Indra and Agni.

Varuṇa, Mitra, and the Ādityas

Characteristic of the two gods is their mystic power, Māyā.1 With it Varuṇa measures out the earth with the sun as with a measure; Varuṇa and Mitra make the sun to cross the sky, the rain to fall, and send the dawns. All physical order is subject to the control of Varuna with or without Mitra: the law of Varuna holds earth and sky apart; the three heavens and the three earths are deposited within him; heaven, earth, and air are supported by the two gods; the wind is the breath of Varuna. By his ordinances the moon moves at night and the stars shine. He embraces the nights and establishes the mornings. He regulates the seasons: the kings, Mitra, Varuna, and Aryaman, dispose the autumn, the month, day and night. From another point of view Mitra and Varuna are essentially connected with rain, and among the gods they are most frequently invoked to bestow the gift of rain. Occa- sionally even in the Rigveda Varuna appears connected with the waters of the ocean, to which flow the seven rivers, but the ocean 2 is little known in the Rigveda, and his real connexion with water is that with the waters of the air, whence comes it that in the Naighanṭuka he is ranked as an aerial no less than a celestial god. 

But more important than these physical attributes of the god are his moral qualities, his control of the order of the world in its ethical aspect no less than in its physical, his connexion with the worshipper as the saviour in time of peril and distress, the freer from sin, the merciful god, as well as the punisher of the sinner to whom he sends the disease, dropsy, which accords with his nature as lord of the waters. This characteristic of Varuṇa is one which will most conveniently be considered below (Chap. 16), but it is essential to note that this side of Varuna's nature is one which steadily disappears in the later texts, though it does not absolutely vanish.3 

In the later literature there are other marked changes in the character of the god. In the first place Mitra and Varuna come to be placed into relation with the sun and the moon respectively: Mitra is said to have produced the day, Varuna the night: the night is Varuna's, the day Mitra's. In the Atharvaveda 4 it is said ‘At evening he is Varuṇa, Agni; Mitra he becometh arising in the morning' and 'That which Varuna hath drawn together, shall Mitra asunder part in the morning.' Even more significant is the fact that in the ritual to Mitra and Varuna respectively white and black victims are sometimes ascribed there can be no doubt of the significance of this dis- tinction in treatment of the two gods. In the second place there is a marked

tendency to reduce Varuṇa to the control of the waters. In the Atharvaveda 1 he is connected with the waters as is Soma with the mountains; his golden house is in the waters; he sheds rain waters, and he and Mitra are the lords of waters. In the Yajurveda similarly the waters are his wives, and he is the child of the waters, in which he establishes his abode, and Mitra and Varuna are the leaders of the waters. It is true that for these conceptions close parallels exist in the Rigveda, but the essential feature is that, in the new matter supplied by these Vedas, nothing which is not specifically connected with the waters is of much account. It is quite possible that the connexion with the moon aided the connexion with the waters, but this cannot be proved; in the Brāhmaṇas we find not merely the recognition of the connexion of the moon with rain, but equally the view that rain comes from the sun. Some force may be assigned to the view that with the growing knowledge of the ocean the tendency to restrict Varuṇa to that element increased parallel with the steady decline in the importance attached to the moral aspect of Varuṇa as a universal ruler. 

Apart from his connexion with Varuna we know little of Mitra: one hymn alone is given to him in the whole of the Rigveda,3 whence we learn that he brings men together by the utterance of his voice, and watches the tillers with unwinking eye. In one passage Savity is identified with him, and Visnu is said to take his three steps by the laws of Mitra, whence it may be assumed that he is supposed to regulate the course of the sun. 

The name 

6 

4 

is normally supposed to have been derived from the use of the word as friend, with which accords the fact that Mitra is essentially a kindly god, and in the Taittiriya Samhita appears as promoting concord: Oldenberg 5 has sug- gested that the use of the word arises rather from the name of the god whom he believes to have been invoked in compacts, perhaps with the use of a fetish of the god as part of the rite and the seven steps, which are mentioned in the Rigveda as a bond of friendship, and which in the marriage ritual are an essential part of the rite. The Iranian Mithra is obviously the same god, and, as his sun nature is almost absolutely certain, it is reasonable and natural to ascribe to the Vedic Mitra the same character. It is no objection to this view that the sun is described as the eye of Mitra: apart from the fact that the separation of the god from the natural substratum is perfectly natural, and can be seen in progress even in the Avesta where Mithra comes forth over the mountain of sunrise before the sun, it must be remembered that, in association with Varuna, Mitra can easily have obtained a description which strictly- applied only to Varuṇa. 

The Adityas form a somewhat indefinite group of gods: in the Rigveda they are accorded six whole hymns and portions of two others. The original number is slightly uncertain; once only in the Rigveda is it given as seven,

and once 1 also as eight, but in that passage the priority of seven is clearly shown by the fact that it is stated that Aditi, their mother, at first presented only seven to the gods, and the eighth, Mārtāṇḍa, sprung of a dead egg,' came afterwards. The number seven is also found observed in the ritual of the Yajurveda 2 at a time when unquestionably the number twelve was normally accepted for the Adityas. But the Rigveda at no time enumerates more than six and that once only, when the list is Mitra, Aryaman, Bhaga, Varuna, Dakṣa, and Anśa. Sūrya, however, is an Aditya in the Rigveda, and he may be taken to make up the seven, with Mārtāṇḍa as the setting sun as the eighth. The Atharvaveda3 gives Aditi eight sons and the Taittiriya Brāhmaṇa gives their names as Mitra, Varuṇa, Aryaman, Añśa, Bhaga, Dhātṛ, Indra and Vivasvant. The term Aditya is, however, applied to Indra, once in connexion with Varuṇa and once as the fourth Aditya. The Aditya par excellence, however, is Varuṇa, next comes Mitra, and next Aryaman. In the Brāhmaṇas the number of the Adityas is normally fixed at twelve, and they are identified with the twelve months. This explanation of their number is much more natural and plausible than the view of Oldenberg that the number is borrowed from the Jagati metre which is associated with the Adityas. In the Maitrāyaṇī Samhitā " we find Indra distinguished expressly from the group of twelve. More generally, however, all the gods seem not rarely to be styled Adityas, as is natural enough since the only real character- istic the group can be said to possess is that they are the gods of the light of the heaven. 

5 

The Adityas, sons of Aditi, as their name denotes, are bright, golden, un- winking, sinless, pure, and holy. They hate falsehood and punish sin; they fetter their enemies, but protect as with armour their votaries, and forgive their wickedness; sickness and distress they repel, and grant the usual boons of long life and offspring. 

Of the individual deities Aryaman, who is Indo-Iranian in character, and may even be akin to the Irish ancestor Airem, has practically no distinctive feature save his friendly nature which makes him a parallel with Mitra : the word also denotes groomsman, and this idea is, it seems, associated with the god, who is thus brought into connexion with human life and marriage. His path is alluded to, whence Indian tradition regards him as the sun, but Weber as the milky way.' Bhaga, as his name denotes, is the bountiful, or perhaps rather the god of good fortune, the disposition which produces in a woman luck in marriage, for a man success in the assembly, in the hunt, în dicing, or in winning pupils, and plays on the name of the god are not un- natural in a religion so full of the spirit of greed for the bounty of the patrons

of the priests; Dawn is his sister, and Yāska describes him as presiding over the forenoon. His name is the equivalent of the Avestan bagha, god,' which is an epithet of Ahura himself, of Bagaios in Phrygia, and of the Old Church Slavonic bogu, 'god'. Anśa is mentioned but three times in all his name denotes the apportioner and nothing but his bounty is recorded. Dakṣa occurs about twice as often, and is a more interesting figure; in one hymn of the late tenth book 2 he is said to be the father of Aditi and also the son of Aditi, and the gods are made later in origin: in another passage the existent and non-existent are said to have been in the womb of Aditi, the birthplace of Dakṣa. The word means no more than ‘clever ', and there can be no doubt that he is the product of priestly ingenuity. The Adityas and also Mitra and Varuṇa are called sons of skill, just as they are called sons of strength: from this epithet the element skill has been elevated into the name of a god, and in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 3 Dakṣa is exalted to the rank of Prajāpati: at no time can he have been anything but a mere abstraction of a type especially dear to the later priestly intelligence, which delighted in the conception of the god, who was at one and the same time the father and the son of his mother. The natural conception which lies at the root of Varuna and the Adityas, is, it is clear, far from obvious. Both Varuna and the group of Adityas have lost or never had immediate connexion with nature, and have developed their individuality in such a way as to make their original identity uncertain. Con- trast with Indra shows that Varuna's original nature must have been some- thing which afforded little chance of the growth of mythology: practically no myth is connected with Varuṇa at all, while the strong god Indra is the subject of by far the greater number of Vedic myths. The name of Varuṇa gives little assistance it has been connected with the Greek Ouranos, but the phonetic correspondence is not yet clearly made out, and the identity must remain doubtful: it seems naturally to be derived from the root vr, cover, so that the first meaning would be the coverer or encompasser, and native tradition explains it in this sense as the god who envelops like darkness or covers with his bonds. If so, the parallel and contrast with Vṛtra are interesting. It is possible that it originally was an epithet of sky, as the all-encompassing, but it would be too dangerous to lay any stress on the apparent etymological sense as denoting the character of the god.

the sun, and he with the Adityas, of whom he is one, were not originally Indo-European gods, but were borrowed by the united Indo-Iranian people from some Semitic race, which had a more advanced knowledge of astronomy than the Vedic Indians, and which knew the five planets, which with the sun and moon made up the seven Adityas. But he does not consider that, when the gods were taken over, they were really fully understood in their original nature by the Indo-Iranians, and in particular he believes that the strongly ethical aspect of Varuna had already been developed, since this fact alone can explain how a moon god took precedence of the sun god Mitra. He rejects of course connexion with Ouranos, and he lays stress on the fact that these two gods seem a distinct innovation as compared with the ordinary Indo-European gods. The conception of Varuṇa as moon god is also shared by Hillebrandt 1 and by Hardy. 

The arguments of Oldenberg are of importance and weight: it is perfectly true that the moral quality of Varuṇa and of the Adityas is of a different species from that of Indra and most of the other members of the Vedic pantheon, to whom morality is rather an outward accretion than an internal principle. It is true also that the history of Indian religion is one of the decadence of Varuna before the claims on the one hand of the warrior god Indra, the god par excellence of the Indian warrior, and on the other hand of Agni, the god of the sacrifice and of the sacrificial priest, and of Prajāpati, in whom the cos- mological and pantheistic views of the more reflective section of the priest- hood found their expression. Prajapati is from the philosophic point of view a much greater personage than Varuna, but he has no real connexion with morality, just as the philosophy of India has no place in which to ascribe to morality any real value. But to hold that this ethical quality must have been introduced from without not only into Indian, but also into Iranian religion, seems to go far beyond what can be made even probable. What ground have we, it must be asked, for denying to the people of Iran the capacity of develop- ing such deities for themselves? The reform of Zoroaster is a proof that Iran was capable of moral fervour and energy, and that Iran was subjected to effective Semitic influence has been rendered most improbable. The decline of Varuna in India is not a proof that the Vedic Indians were incapable of having such a deity as Varuṇa brought with them from earlier Iranian homes, but that the effect of the admixture of race in India itself was fatal to the 

whence Mitra's nature as this sun (Les Indo-Européens, pp. 172 ff.). He sees a triad in India, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman, parallel to Ahura Mazdah, Mithra, Anahita, and thinks the number seven connected with the seven spirits of good and evil, Igigi and Anunnaki.

conception of Varuṇa. Moreover, borrowing of deities can only be made plausible when the precise deity borrowed can be specified and identity of character indicated if not proved, and when the name in addition can be traced. In the case of Varuna and the Adityas the effort to show the group of deities which has been borrowed cannot even be made, and the suggestion of borrowing is therefore methodologically unsound. 

Nor is there really any insuperable difficulty in finding another naturalistic basis for Varuṇa and an explanation of his moral authority. The old view that Varuna is the all encompassing sky is not open to any serious objection. It explains perfectly well all that he does in the physical world: his place, in the highest heaven, his sending of rain, the fact that the sun is his eye, his epithet of far-seeing, his thousand eyes which doubtless point to the stars of night- possibly his spies, though that conception may be otherwise explained as belonging to the conception of him as king1 it is no objection that Varuṇa is represented as mounting a car in the highest heaven with Mitra: the god is clearly to some degree detached from his material substratum, and therefore is treated in this point as any other deity. The conception of an almighty ruler is most casily developed from the vast expanse of the sky, on which the sun moves in its regular course, and which seems to gaze upon the deeds of men. It is of course impossible to prove that Zeus has attained his position in the Hellenic pantheon entirely in this way, but the parallel is certainly striking enough to render the view that Varuṇa thus became a great moral ruler reasonable enough. 

On the other hand the comparison of the Adityas and the Ameśa Spenta seems certainly right and the objections which have been raised to it are not of a serious kind. It is true that neither in India nor in Iran is the number seven absolutely fixed, but as early as the Rigveda the number seven is evidently becoming the normal one, and similarly in the Avesta the number seven is springing up, in the close connexion between Zoroaster and six other spirits. The fact that these six spirits do not correspond in name or function precisely with the Indian deities is of no consequence, if we adopt the view that the deities were not in the Indo-Iranian period very closely connected with any sphere of nature. This is certainly supported by the obvious fact that in India the figures of Bhaga, Anśa, Dakṣa, and Aryaman are abstract, while the whole six in Iran are of this type. To presume an independent 1 Foy, Die königliche Gewalt, pp. 80-6; * See Macdonell, Ved. Myth., p. 44; Hille- 

Moulton (op. cit., p. 61) inclines to deny any celestial character in the god; von Schroeder (Arische Religion, i. 343) finds two roots of Varuṇa's character, the observation of the glories of the sky and the consciousness of the moral law, in harmony with his belief in the latter consideration as one of the three essential roots of religion, beside nature worship and belief in souls.

development of the ideas in both countries is really to assume something much more improbable than a common origin. Oldenberg's theory that the five other than Mitra and Varuṇa represented the planets is wholly without sup- port either in Iran or India, where the knowledge of the planets cannot be attributed at all to the age of the Rigveda or even much later. 

Varuna, Mitra, and the Adityas 

Apart from the question of Semitic origin the identification of Varuṇa with the moon is absolutely without support. It can only be justified by the later Samhitās, which, however, are far more readily explained by the obvious fact that Varuna was being superseded in his position of greatness by Indra, Agni, and Prajapati, and that accordingly it was natural for the priest to seek to find some position for him, which would naturally explain his connexion with Mitra, whose nature as a sun god was never forgotten in Iran or India. With the hypothesis of Varuṇa as a moon god might, of course, be brought into connexion the fact that the Adityas are seven, which has also been cited for their Semitic origin. But there is no rel proof of the existence of any knowledge in Vedic India of a seven-day week,1 and it may be added that, save for the Jewish seven-day week, no such period is proved for any Semitic civilization at an early date. 

Yet another view of the position of Varuṇa and Mitra is that presented by E. Meyer. He sees in them later productions of the religious conception : while Indra, if not in name, at least in essence, is an Indo-European god, being really one aspect of the sky god, Varuṇa and Mitra are essentially pro- ducts of the Indo-Iranian period of religious thought, and the Asuras never are on the same level with the Devas: in India for a time, that is in the period of the Rigveda, they seem to have been to some extent recognized as at least equal with the Devas, and Varuna actually in some circles ranked above Indra, but this condition did not last, and, while in the case of Iran the Zoroastrian reform developed the essential character of the Asuras and made the Daēvas demons, in India the Asuras sank to demons, and Varuṇa was relegated to the position of lord of the sea, while Mitra was little but a name. The origin of the deities he traces in moral, not natural concepts, the nature connexion of the gods being due to the inability of primitive thought to remain at the high pitch of moral conception. Mitra is primarily the lord of the contract, that between individual men no less than that between clans and states, while Varuna is the god of the oath.5 Hence perhaps Varuna is to be deemed to

have been connected with the ocean surrounding the world, by which, as in the case of the Styx in Greek religion, oaths might be taken, and from this connexion with water developed his connexion with the waters of the heaven, the earth, and the ocean alike. But from their moral position the two gods are both essentially celestial, Mitra being especially connected in thought with the sun, while Varuṇa was less definitely restricted in his physical range. The possibility of connexion between Varuṇa and Ouranos Meyer naturally denies.1 

The evidence adduced to the views of Meyer is inadequate; it is quite clear that Varuṇa and Mitra came into special connexion with the agreement and the oath respectively, but neither fact is enough to show that the deity was developed from either conception alone, and we cannot prove that it is more plausible to assume such a derivation than to accept the view that to these great gods of the sky the conception of the control of moral order and contract was naturally assigned. The importance of the sun as a deity is sufficiently shown for Iranian religion by the fact that he became the chief god of the Massagetae, and the importance of Mithra as a sun-god in later Iran is notorious. It is on the other hand more easy to understand how concrete gods attained moral aspects3 than to believe that moral gods became so remarkably concrete in nature.
