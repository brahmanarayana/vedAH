      <description>THE minor figures of the Vedic mythology are distinguished as a rule by the obscurity of their outlines: even when they are freely mentioned, as in the case of the Ṛbhus, it is a matter of the utmost difficulty to decide their precise character: it is probable indeed that in many cases the nature of the gods was little better understood by their worshippers than it is by us. Of this there is an excellent example in the Rbhus: they occur in eleven hymns in the Rigveda, being special favourites of the Bharadvāja family, and they are mentioned over a hundred times, but their mythical nature is very doubtful, and the Atharvaveda mentions them but eight times in seven hymns, and adds nothing to their character, indicating that in the popular side of the Vedic religion they had little hold.</description>

      <description>There is a certain curious paucity of evidence of worship of constellations other than the sun and the moon, especially in its connexion with Soma,&amp;quot; and the planets seem to have attracted little notice. Whether we believe or not that they were known to the Vedic Indians, at any rate it is obvious that they received no direct worship in the period of the Rigveda, and it is not until the close of the Vedic ritual that we have enumerations of them such as that of the Baudhāyana Dharma Sūtra,10 which gives in a late passage sun, moon, Añgāraka, Budha, Bṛhaspati, Śukra, Śanaiścara, Rāhu and Ketu.</description>

      <title>02 The Gandharvas and the Apsarases</title>

      <description>In the Rigveda the word Gandharva occurs twenty times, but only thrice in the plural, from which it is fair to deduce that the nature of the spirit was originally conceived as one. What is still more important is that it occurs but once in book ii-vii, and is found twice in the eighth book as a being hostile to Indra. The epithet viṭvāvasu, &amp;lsquo;possessing all good things&amp;rsquo;, which accompanies it, appears once in the Rigveda 1 itself, and often later, to denote a definite individual.</description>

      <title>03 Spirits of the Forest, the Trees, and the Plants</title>

      <description>5
The references to the worship of the tree and the plants are very scanty in the Vedic ritual and mythology alike, but they are quite adequate to show that as among all other peoples these objects were not without their share of reverence. A long hymn in the last book of the Rigveda is devoted to the deification of the plants with special reference to their healing properties, and plants also appear in the Atharvaveda, where they are used in spells for healing, and for driving away demons of all kinds: the plant is even besought to bestow a horse, a sheep, a garment, and the life of the patient, who doubtless was to be the instrument by which the prayer of the medicine man was to be made good if the spell succeeded in attaining its purpose.</description>

The deity of the field as Kṣetrasya Pati, &amp;rsquo; lord of the field&amp;rsquo;, in the Rigveda 1 is invoked to grant cattle and horses, and with sweetness to fill heaven and earth, the plants, and the waters. In another hymn a he is asked, along with Savitṛ, the Dawns, and Parjanya to bestow prosperity, and elsewhere it is said that worshippers are fain to have him as a neighbour.</description>

      <description>2
The deity of the house and the home is Vāstospati, ‘lord of the dwelling&amp;rsquo;, who is invoked in one short hymn of the Rigveda to bless man and beast, to remove diseases, to make cattle and horses prosper, to afford protection, and to grant a favourable entry. He is elsewhere described as destroyer of diseases, is identified with Soma, brought into close connexion with Tvaṣṭr as an artificer, or again he is likened to Indra as a cuirass of Soma pressers.</description>

      <title>06 Divine Implements</title>

      <description>There is no very essential distinction between the worship of natural objects conceived as living and the worship of objects made by human hands, but it is obvious that the worship of such objects tends to be restricted in effect and importance. This is borne out by the evidence of Vedic religion where such religion is of very minor importance, despite the fact that it receives further attention in the Rigveda than might a priori have been expected.</description>

      <title>07 Divine Animals</title>

      <description>The place of animals in the Veda is restricted and of comparatively little importance so far as it concerns direct worship of animals, whether individuals or species, as distinct from the theriomorphism of gods who are not animal gods, and the use of animal fetishes. But the existence of these different ways, in which an animal may seem to be divine, renders it difficult in each case to say whether or not direct worship of animal is to be detected.</description>

      <description>The nature and meaning of totemism are so uncertain and ill defined that it would be necessary to examine the concept in detail, if it were not for the fact that, on any theory of totemism which does not reduce it to the worship of animals, there is no support for the view that that phenomenon is to be found in Vedic religion. The essential feature of a totemist community as conceived by S.</description>

      <description>Not one of the goddesses of the Rigveda, with the doubtful exception of the Dawn, can be said to be of any real importance. Sarasvati and Pṛthivï have already been mentioned: in the Sûtras Bhūmi also appears, but with little character of any kind, doubtless as a direct expression for the earth
1 VS. xxx. 8; ŚB. xiii. 2. 4. 2. Such ideas are common in Babylonian religion. Cf. werwolves, Carnoy, Les Indo-Européens, p.</description>
