The deity of the house and the home is Vāstospati, ‘lord of the dwelling', who is invoked in one short hymn of the Rigveda to bless man and beast, to remove diseases, to make cattle and horses prosper, to afford protection, and to grant a favourable entry. He is elsewhere described as destroyer of diseases, is identified with Soma, brought into close connexion with Tvaṣṭr as an artificer, or again he is likened to Indra as a cuirass of Soma pressers. In the late tenth book 3 he appears as an observer of ordinances, who was fashioned by the gods along with prayer. His character is made more clear by the fact that the Gṛhya Sūtras prescribe that offerings are to be made to him when a new house is entered. There is no possible ground for supposing that either Pūṣan," or Rudra, or Agni,” or any other god is designated by the title, though Rudra actually bears the style in one passage. The god is clearly the god of the house, who when a new house is built comes and abides in it. In the Sūtras' we hear more generally of deities of the house.
