Not one of the goddesses of the Rigveda, with the doubtful exception of the Dawn, can be said to be of any real importance. Sarasvati and Pṛthivï have already been mentioned: in the Sûtras Bhūmi also appears, but with little character of any kind, doubtless as a direct expression for the earth

goddess. The Rigveda 1 also celebrates Rātri, 'night', as the sister of the Dawn, and the daughter of heaven. But night is here conceived as the bright starlit night, which fills the valleys and the hills and drives away the darkness, keeping away the wolf and the thief. Night is also a few times invoked together with the dawn as joint goddesses, and their importance such as it is seems derived from her connexion with that goddess.

Another goddess who is clearly connected with nature is Prśni, the mother of the Maruts, who is doubtless the storm cloud : the word is properly an adjective 'speckled', used of the bull, or the cow, and in the plural of the cows, which milk Soma for Indra. More interesting is the figure of Saraṇyū who occurs in a curious legend in the Rigveda, in which it is narrated that Tvastr made a wedding for his daughter, that at the news all the world came together, that during the wedding Saranyū disappeared, but not it seems until she had been married to Vivasvant, that the gods hid the immortal from mortals, and making one of like form they gave her to Vivasvant: it is added that Saraṇyu bore the two Aśvins when this happened and left two pairs behind her. Yāska tells us that she first bore the pair Yama and Yami, and then changed her form to that of a mare and ran away: Vivasvant in the form of a horse pursued, and then were born the Aśvins, while on the female of like form was born Manu Sāvarṇi. The tale is a strange one, and may be compared with the legend of the Tilphossian Erinys, who bore in horse form the steed Areion; the two myths probably belong to the same order of ideas, but it is difficult to say what the origin of the conception should be taken to have been. The horse form of Saraṇyū does not occur in the Rigveda : it can only be inferred and we do not know from what source Yāska obtained the details of the legend: it may have been an old tradition or merely a speculation: moreover the idea may have been caused by nothing more than the conception of the Aśvins who may have been thought to have been in horse form, and not merely lords of horses, in which case the comparison with the Erinys must probably be given up. On the other hand, especially if the comparison is held to be valid, the figure of Saraṇyu may be brought into connexion with the Dawn, or the sun-maiden, whose swift nature her name would then be a good expression, since it is essentially derived from the root, sṛ, 'run '. The verbal correspondence with Erinys cannot however be accepted as proved, as it is clearly contrary to the phonology. Such a view, which is defended by Bloomfield, is more plausible than the suggestion which connects Saraṇyū with the storm, and which, accepting the identity with Erinys, seeks to trace the character of the Erinyes to this conception.

and Erinys as loan words from another tongue. The conjecture is possible that the term Erinys did not originally belong to the horse goddess at all, but that she bore a name really corresponding to Saraṇyū, but later confused with Erinys. * Culles, Mythes et Religions, iv. 54–68.

in Europe an old horse goddess (originally totemistic), found in Arcadia, in the legend of Cloelia, and as Epona in Gaul.

There is another group of goddesses of whom it can safely be said that in the later Samhitas they are the deities of natural objects, though the Rigveda leaves their character wholly uncertain and unexplained. These are Rākā, who twice appears in the Rigveda 1 as a rich and bountiful goddess, with which her name, probably containing the root rā, 'give', accords; and Sinivāli, described as a sister of the gods, with broad hips, fair arms and fingers, who is begged to give children. She is invoked with Rākā, Sarasvati, and with Guñgū, who only occurs in this place.' These later Saṁhitãs, however, have a scheme under which Rākā is the full moon day, Anumati the day before full moon, Kuhů new moon, and Sinivāli the day before new moon. Sinīvālī is also said by the Atharvaveda 3 to be the wife of Viṣṇu. While it is true that the explanations are not given in the Rigveda and that, in the case of Anumati, the position given seems to be secondary, it is difficult to be certain as to the others, with whom may be connected the otherwise unknown Gungu.

Possibly another deity who plays some part in the development of Vedic thought may be traced to a natural origin, namely Vac, 'speech'. In the Rigveda 5 she has a hymn in which she describes herself as accompanying all the gods, and supporting Mitra and Varuṇa, Indra and Agni, and the Aśvins, and as bending the bow of Rudra against the unbeliever: she claims to have a place in the waters, in the sea, and to encompass all beings, while in another hymn she is styled the queen of the gods. In the Brāhmaṇas * she is specially famed in the legend of the purchase of the Soma from the Gandharvas by means of a woman, Vāc taking that form to tempt the Gandharvas, as lovers of the sex, to surrender the Soma which they guard: she agrees, however, with the gods, before the transaction takes place, to return to them and does so when called upon. The goddess seems to have too much life and reality in the Rigveda to be a mere abstraction, and it is important perhaps that in the Naighanṭuka she is ranked among the gods of the atmosphere. Therefore it is possible that thunder, which in the Nirukta appears as the Vac of the middle region, may be the starting-point of the goddess who naturally develops in connexion with human speech.

It is also possible that in Umã, who appears at the very end of the Vedic period proper as the wife of Rudra, we have a goddess of the mountain, as she

The Gods and Demons of the Veda 

[Part II 

is given the epithet Haimavati, and is recognized in the later mythology as the daughter of the mountain Himavant. On the other hand it must be remembered that, as Rudra is essentially a god of the mountains in the Vedic texts, it was only natural that his wife should be made out to be from the mountains, and that, therefore, we may have to do here simply with the same principle of setting a female beside the god which gives us Indrāṇī, and the other wives of the gods, though it is tempting to see in Umã a form of the mother goddess of the Dravidians. 

A goddess who owes her nature to the actual sacrificial food is Iḍā,1 the offering of milk and butter which occurs several times in the Rigveda, and more often later. Like Aditi and more naturally, she is brought into connexion with the cow, and a cow is used in the ritual to represent her and Aditi, and addressed with her name. She bears the names butter-handed and butterfooted, which express clearly her nature, and she normally appears with the goddesses Sarasvati and Bhāratī. Agni is said to be her son, because of his birth from the place of the Iḍā, and a mortal man Purŭravas is called Aiļa,2 which seems to denote him as an offshoot from Iḍā. She is also connected in the Rigveda with Urvaśi, with Dadhikrāvan, and with the Aśvins. She figures in the legend of Manu, who after the flood through her generated the human race, Iḍā being called his daughter. She is styled also the daughter of Mitra and Varuna. Bharati, who occurs with Iḍā, is clearly the offering (hotrā) of the Bharatas, a fact which accords with the importance of the Bharatas in cult. Iḍā, Sarasvati, and Bhārati are called in the Yajurveda the wives of Indra,' and in the Rigveda a goddess Bṛhaddivā, ‘of the broad sky', is mentioned with Iḍā, Sarasvati, and Rākā, but of her nature nothing more is known.8
