There is a certain curious paucity of evidence of worship of constellations other than the sun and the moon, especially in its connexion with Soma," and the planets seem to have attracted little notice. Whether we believe or not that they were known to the Vedic Indians, at any rate it is obvious that they received no direct worship in the period of the Rigveda, and it is not until the close of the Vedic ritual that we have enumerations of them such as that of the Baudhāyana Dharma Sūtra,10 which gives in a late passage sun, moon, Añgāraka, Budha, Bṛhaspati, Śukra, Śanaiścara, Rāhu and Ketu.

influences, signified in the term Grahas, seizers ', applied to the planets, seem not to have troubled the imagination of the early Indians.1 

The Nakṣatras figure early in the myths of Soma and his marriage with them which is recorded in the later Samhitās and Brāhmaṇas, and in the ritual they receive occasional offerings, but appear to be of little religious con- sequence. The same consideration applies to the seasons, months and half months, the days and nights, and the year,3 or even the night of new moon, that is when the moon is invisible, or the night of full moon, or the period when the moon first appears (amāvāsyā, paurṇamāsi, darśa), though the latter three entities are honoured by Atharvan hymns. More personality is ac- corded to the moon phases, Anumati, Sinīvālī, Rākā, and Kuhû, which have already been denoted," and still more to Ekāṣṭakā, a lunar day near the beginning of the year, which is celebrated as being the daughter of Prajapati, and the mother of Indra. Such importance, however, as this or any other of the Aṣṭakās,' lunar days in the middle of th⚫ fortnight of declining moonlight, may possess, is doubtless really due to connexion with the offerings then made to the Fathers, whose connexion with the moon was doubtless strongly felt, since it is accepted as a dogma in the Upaniṣads.

In the domestic ritual we find the pole star, Dhruva, accorded a measure of respect, and similar honour is paid to the Seven Seers, that is the Great Bear, and Arundhati. The Seven Seers already receive in the Rigveda the credit of having in a time of trouble secured for Purukutsa's wife a son, Trasadasyu, but in their case we have unquestionably to do with the concep- tion of the souls of the dead entering into the stars. They are said to have settled in heaven to practice asceticism, and with the five Adhvaryus to guard the hidden footprint of the bird, and their relation with the seven Hotṛs on earth is obvious, whether it be that of prototypes or derivatives. The suggestion 10 that the five Adhvaryus denote the planets, because of the similarity of their movements to and fro may be deemed most implausible. Mysterious are the five Bulls who stand in the middle of the sky; it is certain 

Possibly they are meant in HGS. i. 8. 10. 4, where Śaka may be connected with the mysterious Śakadhūma of the Athar- vaveda (vi. 128; SBE. xlii. 160, 532 ff.). * See above, Chap. 10, §8.

from the terminology that they are not the planets, and we may best suppose that they are the stars of some asterism, seen there by the Indian mind. 

Hillebrandt suggests that the pole star is to be found not merely in the Dhruva of the domestic ritual, but in the Aghnya to whose head the Aśvins are said to fasten one wheel of their chariot, while the other encircles the heaven, comparing the view of later times that the sun, moon, and stars are fastened to the pole star. An alternative view makes the inviolable one the sun, and it is clear that to assume the pole star in the absence of any other hint of its existence in the Rigveda is unwise. He treats Etaśa, who is usually regarded merely as the steed of the sun, as the morning and evening star, com- paring him to the later Aruna, who does not certainly appear in the Vedic literature. Other efforts have been made to discover the Pleiades 3 and the Milky Way as well as other stars in various mythological figures, but without marked plausibility.
