## 1. The Rbhus and the Ṛtus 

THE minor figures of the Vedic mythology are distinguished as a rule by the obscurity of their outlines: even when they are freely mentioned, as in the case of the Ṛbhus, it is a matter of the utmost difficulty to decide their precise character: it is probable indeed that in many cases the nature of the gods was little better understood by their worshippers than it is by us. Of this there is an excellent example in the Rbhus: they occur in eleven hymns in the Rigveda, being special favourites of the Bharadvāja family, and they are mentioned over a hundred times, but their mythical nature is very doubtful, and the Atharvaveda mentions them but eight times in seven hymns, and adds nothing to their character, indicating that in the popular side of the Vedic religion they had little hold.

It appears that there are strictly three Rbhus, named Rbhuksan, "lord' or chief of the Rbhus ', which is also an epithet of Indra, Vāja, and Vibhvan. It was, however, natural that the number should be increased, and we hear of all the Rbhus, or Ṛbhu with the Rbhus, or Vibhvan with the Vibhus, and, it may be added, the Praișa for the god Indra at the evening pressing in one version adds Prabhus. They are called Saudhanvanas, offspring of Sudhanvan, * the good archer ', or sons of Indra, and by a play on Indra's epithet, ‘ son of strength', they appear as 'descendants of strength'. On the other hand they are also sons of Manu, and claim Agni as brother. They are bright deities, who ride on a car drawn by fat steeds; they have metal helmets and fair necklaces. 

The essential features of the Ṛbhus is their connexion with Indra, through whom they are also connected with the Maruts and obtain a share of the Soma drink, which, however, in the ritual is whittled down to a share in an invoca- tion to Indra. With other gods they have but slight connexion such as the Mountains, Rivers, the Adityas, Savitṛ, and Tvaṣtṛ. Their chief distinction is their skill, which wins them the favour of Indra and immortality, for they are distinctly regarded as men of the air, who earned for themselves immortality by their deeds, not as from the beginning divine. The Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 1 states they obtained their position by means of austerities, a view which of course entirely agrees with the priestly estimate of the due means of securing divine rank, but which ignores the older and simpler conception of their skill as the adequate cause. Having attained that position, they are addressed as

gods, and are besought to bestow boons on their worshippers, including the dexterity which is theirs specially: they also aid in battle. 

Five great feats of skill are enumerated as performed by the Rbhus, the making of a car which, horseless, reinless, with three wheels, travels space, for the Aśvins; the fashioning for Indra of two bay steeds; the making out of a hide of a cow, seemingly for Bṛhaspati, to milk nectar, of which a variant seems to be the uniting of the mother with her calf; the rejuvenating of their ancient and frail parents, doubtless heaven and earth; and, last but not least, the making of Tvaṣtṛ's one cup into four. This they did on the bidding of the gods through Agni, and the promise of immortality was the bait: Tvastr seems to have approved the proposal,1 but in one place he is said to have been fain to slay them for this desecration of the cup of the gods, while they deny the desecration. Other feats are more commonplace: they fashion the sacrifice or the two worlds. 

In a curious myth they are connected with Savitṛ. It seems that they went round the sky in swift flight, and came to the house of Savitṛ, who bestowed immortality upon them, when they came to Agohya. When after twelve days of slumber they had enjoyed Agohya's hospitality, they made the fields to flourish and the streams to flow over the earth. They after a year looked around they asked Agohya who had wakened them. When they slumbered in his house, they made grass on the heights and water in the depths.3 

An elaborate theory of their nature has been proposed by Hillebrandt.* He lays stress on the fact that, when they pleased the gods by their work, they became the artificers of the gods, Rbhukṣan of Indra, Vibhvan of Varuņa, and Vāja of the gods generally. Now the four-month offerings are the Vaiśvadeva, the Varuṇapraghāsas, and the Sākamedhas, and he puts the three Ṛbhus in contact with the three sets of offerings, and sees, therefore, în them the three seasons. Further, he holds that the twelve days' slumber must refer to the period of twelve nights at the winter solstice known in German folklore and mythology: in this still period of the year when the sun is at a standstill, the geniuses of the seasons exert their creative power. In the ritual this is the Dvādaśāha, the twelve day rite', which is of the utmost importance for the ritual as it serves as a model for all Sattras, and it is in this rite that most of the Rbhu hymns are used. Moreover, he adds that at the end of the year the Ṛtus," the seasons', are offered to in the Gṛhya ritual of the Aṣṭakās, and also occur in the Çrauta ritual. But all this is mere conjecture, as is the suggestion which has been made that the cup of Tvastṛ is the moon,

the four parts being either replicas of the four months of each of the seasons, or four moon phases.1 The attempt to bring the four-month offerings into conjunction with the Ṛbhus is a very forced one and is not supported by any- thing save the vague connexion of names, by which almost anything could be established; the belief that the Indians and the Germans preserve a tradition of twelve days' rest of nature at the winter solstice is a most improbable idea,a and the Dvadaśãha obviously connects with the number of the months. Nor is it in the slightest degree intelligible how, if that were the case, the three seasons by sleeping then would procure grass and water in abundance. Nor is the assertion that the Ṛbhus are really the Ṛtus in the slightest degree plausible: the seasonal cups of the Soma sacrifice have no real relation to Ṛbhus at all. Finally he makes the ingenious suggestion that the contemned position of the Rbhus is due to the fact that these are the gods of a particular clan, who took to the work of chariot making, were not admitted for a long time to the Brahmanical circle, but eventually found admission through their skill in this useful art, a fact which may stand in relation to the name Ṛbhu, which he equates not with the German ‘Elbe', but with the root arb seen in 'Arbeit '.3 The evidence for this theory consists simply in the fact that at the laying of the fire a Rathakṛt according to some Sūtras * should mention as his forefathers the Rbhus, and the name Saudhanvana is stated in late texts to denote a caste. The case is an interesting one, not because it makes the theory of Hillebrandt at all tenable, but because it shows how the Rathakṛt, being a skilled chariot maker, was advised to claim as his forefathers the Rbhus, the chariot makers par excellence. 

5

Other theories are even less plausible: Weber sees in them the geniuses of the past, present, and future, and in Agohya the sun who may not be concealed, i. e. driven from his course even by the winter solstice; Bergaigne * takes them as three ancient skilful sacrificers who attained immortality, and whose number three stands in connexion with the three fires. The evidence forbids any certainty or even probability: it is, however, most probable that they are identical with the German * Elbe ', and that they are elves of the air or the earth who have won their way to a divine greatness. By an extraordinary freak we find them in the Mahābhārata elevated to the stature of the greatest of gods imaginable.

The Gandharvas and the Apsarases

## 2. The Gandharvas and the Apsarases 

In the Rigveda the word Gandharva occurs twenty times, but only thrice in the plural, from which it is fair to deduce that the nature of the spirit was originally conceived as one. What is still more important is that it occurs but once in book ii-vii, and is found twice in the eighth book as a being hostile to Indra. The epithet viṭvāvasu, 'possessing all good things', which accom- panies it, appears once in the Rigveda 1 itself, and often later, to denote a definite individual. The Gandharva of that text is a high being of the air of the sky, a measurer of space who stands erect on the vault of heaven. He is brought into relation with the sun, the sun-bird, the sun-steed, and Soma likened to the sun. He is also connected with the rainbow in a late hymn.* He is, however, especially connected with Soma, whose place he guards, standing on the vault of heaven. Kṛśanu, the archer, who shoots at the eagle which steals the Soma, is expressly said in a later text to be a Gandharva. But the Gandharva is also connected with the waters: Soma in the waters is said to be the Gandharva of the waters: the parents of Yama and Yami are the Gandharva and the maiden of the waters: the Gandharva is the lover of the Apsaras. The Gandharva is further found in the marriage ceremony: the bride is claimed by him, and he is in the beginning of the marriage a rival of the husband. Further the Gandharva has a fragrant 

garment," and is wind-haired." 

3 

In the later Samhitās the account of the Gandharvas is fuller, but not essentially different: there is now a class which can be mentioned beside the gods, Fathers, and Asuras; they have a definite world of their own like the gods or the Fathers, to which a man may attain; the number is sometimes twenty-seven, which is the number of the Nakṣatras, or even 6388,® Celestial traits are still numerous : • his abode is in heaven, Rohiņi and the stars of the moon's orbit are brought into connexion with the Gandharva; he is mentioned with such deities as Agni, sun, moon, and wind, and in the post-Vedic litera- ture the Fata Morgana are connected with the Gandharva.10 But the Soma myth is especially developed. We learn that the Gandharvas kept Soma for the gods, but, allowing it to be stolen, were punished by exclusion from drinking it." Viśvāvasu has to be eluded by Soma in eagle form, a fact which no doubt explains the hostility of Indra to the Gandharva in the eighth book

The Gods and Demons of the Veda 

[Part II 

of the Rigveda.1 Soma is stated to have been stolen by Viśvävasu or at least to have lived among the Gandharvas, but the gods by the bribe of Vac, 'speech', were able to induce them to give him up,2 the Gandharvas being fond of women, while Vāc agreed to come back when her former owners called her, a fact which is an interesting parallel to the legend which makes the Soma seller lose the price paid to him for the Soma. The connexion with the waters appears in the mention of his abode with the Apsarases in the waters in the Atharvaveda. That text also states that the Gandharva knows plants, doubtless the Soma, and that the odour of the earth arises to him, pro- bably an idea due to folk etymology with gandha, odour. 

7 

In the Brāhmaṇa texts and in the ritual the connexion between the Apsarases and the Gandharvas is especially close: the Gandharva Ūrṇāyu sits among the Apsarases, who swing themselves, and is beloved by them : in a rite the priest can point to the young men and the young maidens present, when he means to indicate the Gandharvas and Apsarases. They are besought to bestow progeny, and in the Buddhist texts the being, which by the law of transmigration enters the womb at the time of conception, is called a Gandhabba. For the nights immediately after the marriage, when the newly wedded couple are not allowed to consummate the marriage, a staff which represents the Gandharva Viśvāvasu is placed between them, and not until it is formally dismissed to the highest region is the marriage completed. A different and lower view of the Gandharvas is also found in the Atharvaveda® where the plant goat's horn is used to drive off the Gandharvas, who are regarded as shaggy with half animal forms, and are said to seek to ruin women in the guise of an ape, a dog, a hairy child, or a friend. 

· 

In the Avesta there is a being, a Gandarewa, who dwells in the sea Vouru- kaša and is defeated by the heroic Keresāspa. He is also a lord of the bays, who dwells in the waters, and his identity with the Gandharva is clearly undeniable. The further comparison of Kentauros 10 is certainly untenable phonetically, unless it be assumed that both are loan words, and is open to the gravest objections on the grounds of the nature of the two conceptions: the few points of similarity cannot be traced in the Rigvedic conception at all. 

The nature of the Gandharva cannot well be expressly defined: there can be no doubt whatever that he is in his origin a creature of the heaven: the light side of his nature is obvious and persistent despite other traits. The

connexion with water can be traced to various sources: either the waters of the sky are the basis on which his activity has been transferred to the waters of earth, or his association with the Apsarases has led to his connexion with the waters, or as is quite possible the obscuration of his original nature has rendered it possible to associate him with elements not originally his own. It is more difficult to see how the demons of the Atharvaveda who are no better than Piśācas—indeed in a Buddhist text 1 Piśăcas replace Gandharvas in con- junction with the Apsarases-can be developed from the Gandharva of the Rigveda. It is most probable that this is simply a case where demons have been allowed to obtain a name which is not theirs by right, the point of con- tact being found in the connexion of the Gandharva with marriage, which leads to the doubtless secondary connexion of the Gandharva with the embryo. The Gandharva, therefore, is not in the secondary period of the Vedic religion any longer a single concept: he is compounded of different and in essence disparate ideas.

What the original nature of the Rigvedic Gandharva was, cannot, as has been said, be precisely elucidated to Kuhn he is a cloud spirit, to Wallis 3 the rising sun, to Bergaigne Soma, to Hopkins a genius of the moon, and to Roth the rainbow. To a different idea belongs the view taken by Mann- hardt, E. H. Meyer, and von Schroeder,' which sees in him a wind spirit developed out of the conception of the spirits of the dead as riding in the wind and passing therefore into wind spirits. Hillebrandt 1o thinks that the real meaning of the name Gandharva is giant, and that the name is applied to different potencies, now and then to wind spirits, in other cases to the sun, since he finds that it is mentioned of Viśvāvasu that he kept Soma hidden for three nights as Soma is the moon in the view of Hillebrandt, this can refer only to the obscuration of the moon for three nights by the sun, and therefore of course the Gandharva must be the sun. This form of argument is by no means convincing, and, as against the theory of wind gods, it must be pointed out that only once in the Rigveda is there any possible mention of wind in connexion with the Gandharva, and from such an incidental idea no con- clusion can ever be drawn to the nature of a Vedic deity. 

Of the Apsaras in the Rigveda is mentioned her connexion with the Gandharva upon whom she smiles in the highest heaven. Vasistha also claims birth from an Apsaras, and the Vasisthas are said to have sat close to the Apsarases. The long-haired Muni, or ascetic with magic powers, moves

on the path of the Gandharvas and the Apsarases.1 The water nymph who is the spouse of the Gandharva is clearly the Apsaras. The connexion with water is brought out still more clearly in its most primitive form when the Apsarases of the sea are described as flowing to the Soma, a mythic description of the mixing of water with the Soma. The description of the Apsarases, therefore, agrees entirely and completely with the meaning of their name : they are the goers in the water', water nymphs, and already in the Rigveda they are not confined to the waters of the earth, though they were perhaps there first located.

In the Atharvaveda and the Yajurveda the connexion of the Apsarases with the waters is frequently expressed: they abide in the waters, they are often asked to depart from men to the river and the bank of the waters, possibly a hint at the dangerous quality of the nymphs. The Apsarases who accompany the Gandharva Viśvāvasu are connected with clouds, lightning, and stars, and all the later Saṁhitās agree in calling them the wives of the Gandharvas. In the Catapatha Brahmana they appear as swimming about in a lake in the form of birds (ātī), and the later literature often treats them as water spirits, in forest lakes, in rivers, even in Varuna's palace in the ocean. But they have also a further field of activity; they dwell in the banyan and the fig-tree, according to the Atharvaveda," where their cymbals and their lutes resound. The Gandharvas and Apsarases in these trees are begged to be propitious to a passing wedding party. They are also said to be engaged in dance and song and play, but the Atharvaveda' mentions some sinister characteristics: if they are fond of dice, and bestow good luck in gambling, they are also liable to cause madness, and magic has to be employed against them in this regard. The post-Vedic literature also finds them with the Gandharvas in trees, and adds mountains to their places of habitation. It is perhaps from them that the Gandharva attains his power of causing derangement or at least mental excitement, which is attested for the Brah- mana period by the phrase 'seized by a Gandharva ', used of a lady who is inspired or demented." 

One Apsaras only is named in the Rigveda, the famous Urvaśi. She was the mother of Vasiṣṭha,10 who claimed also descent from Mitra and Varuņa, and she is invoked with the streams. But the chief reference to her is in a

hymn1 of considerable interest and obscurity, in which she is loved by Purura- vas. She is there connected with water, filling the atmosphere and traversing space. It is said that she spends four autumns among mortals, and she is invoked to return, but that request she refuses, promising, however, Purûravas that his offspring will worship the gods, and he himself will enjoy happiness in heaven. The hymn clearly refers to one of those alliances of nymphs and men, which are common in all literatures as in the stories of Thetis and of the German swan maidens, who often for as long as seven years are allowed to stay with mortal men. In the Çatapatha Brāhmaṇa several interesting details are given, which, however, cannot be read into the Rigvedic account, and, therefore, may rest on later alteration and embellishment of the narative. Pururavas is united to Urvaśi, but only on condition that she shall never see him naked the Gandharvas envying their union, which subtracts her from their midst, devise a plan by which the sheep which Urvaśi keeps with her is stolen away: Purüravas leaps from his couch to prevent the theft he forgets to put on his garment, for he thought it long that he should do so,' and he is revealed in a flash of light to the nymph who departs forthwith. Purūravas seeks desperately for her over the earth, until he comes upon her swimming in a lotus lake along with other Apsarases in the shape of aquatic birds. Urvaśi reveals herself to him and consents to receive him on a night a year later, when the Gandharvas enable him to become one of themselves by producing the sacrificial fire in a certain way. The tale has, of course, in any case been remodelled to suit the purpose of advocating the special mode proposed of producing the fire, but the episode of the taboo of seeing the hero naked is of interest and primitive in nature. It may be, as von Schroeder 3 suggests, an inversion of the same rule applied to the maiden, since the German legends of swan maidens lay always stress on the absolute necessity of the maiden not being seen in her true nature, but the transfer need not be certainly assumed. Pururavas is only once elsewhere mentioned in the Rigveda, where it is said that Agni caused the sky to thunder for the righteous Pururavas, though, as the name means he who calls aloud', it is possible that in that passage the word is merely an epithet. In any case the view of Weber 5 and Max Müller that Pururavas is the sun and Urvaśî the dawn is quite unnecessary, while Siecke's attempt to show that Urvaśi is the moon is based on the same curious reasoning as all his efforts to fill the Rigveda with moon deities. Purūravas is simply a hero, not necessarily ever a real man, but conceived as one later tradition derives the lunar race of kings from him.

veda 1 mentions Ugrajit, Ugraṁpaśya, and Răṣṭrabhṛt, and the Yajurveda * names among many others Menakă and Urvaśi. The Çatapatha Brāhmaṇa 3 mentions also a nymph, who is famous in later story, Çakuntala, as the mother of the king Bharata. 

## 3. Spirits of the Forest, the Trees, and the Plants 

5 

The references to the worship of the tree and the plants are very scanty in the Vedic ritual and mythology alike, but they are quite adequate to show that as among all other peoples these objects were not without their share of reverence. A long hymn in the last book of the Rigveda is devoted to the deification of the plants with special reference to their healing properties, and plants also appear in the Atharvaveda, where they are used in spells for healing, and for driving away demons of all kinds: the plant is even besought to bestow a horse, a sheep, a garment, and the life of the patient, who doubt- less was to be the instrument by which the prayer of the medicine man was to be made good if the spell succeeded in attaining its purpose. In the Rigveda 7 Soma is already the king of the plants, and they are called mothers and god- desses: the Atharvaveda poetically describes a plant as a goddess born of the goddess earth. On the other hand plants have power to hinder child-birth, and in that case the offering of an animal victim to them is prescribed by the Tait- tirīya Samhita in order to procure their favour.

The cult of trees, and above all of forest trees, Vanaspati, is recognized by the Rigveda,10 which in a few passages invokes either one or many along with the Waters and the Mountains. In the later Saṁhitās, as we have seen, trees are the favourite homes of the Apsarases and also of the Gandharvas. The Taittiriya Saṁhitā 11 assigns to them as their homes the trees Aśvattha, Nyagrodha, Udumbara, and Plakṣa. When the wedding procession passes by large trees, these deities are to be besought to afford their favour. More directly, in the same ceremony, in some accounts the tree is solemnly honoured on the fifth day after marriage with gifts of flowers, of food and clothing, and the part of trees in the marriage ritual is one of the commonest features of Indian marriage among the less advanced tribes.1 There is, however, no trace in the Vedic literature of the marriage to a tree, which in modern India often precedes certain classes of marriages.

The belief in the life of the tree is very clearly seen in the treatment of the tree from which the sacrificial post is to be taken. The necessary cutting is performed after a blade of grass has been put over the place where the blow is to be inflicted, and the blade is hidden to protect the tree, while the axe is expressly ordered to harm not the tree: the prescription is precisely the same as that adopted in the domestic ritual when the hair is cut, and in the ordinary cult when the victim is slain: the aim is clearly to avoid injury to the life in the tree by pretending that it is not being injured. The tree is also, when made into the form of a post, adorned with a band placed round it and is anointed, and this doubtless proves its living character, while it is possible that the verse in the Apri litany of the animal sacrifice, addressed to the forest tree, is really an adjuration to the sacrificial post. The evidence must not be unduly pressed, as in this case, owing to the presence of the god at the place of sacrifice, it is beyond doubt that the surroundings of the sacrifice are filled with his presence, and that, therefore, they may attain a sanctity not their own; but the conception of the life of the tree is clear, even if its divinity is not so certain in this special instance.

The belief in the presence of spirits in trees is, of course, ethnic and the Buddhist literature has many traces of it, showing the different sets of con- ceptions which are easily formed; the tree is primarily the spirit, then the spirit with or without its children lives in the tree, and, if it perishes, has to go away to seek a new abode, while at a further stage the tree becomes more and more remotely connected with the deity. This literature is also instructive in the fact that it mentions other than tree spirits, spirits of terrible form and uncanny and hostile nature, who may well be of double origin, arising from a direct or animatistic conception of the darkness and hostility of the woods, and also from the conception of unfriendly spirits which develops from the belief in the hostile spirits of the dead. The Rigveda preserves one hymn in its last book, describing the forest goddess, Araṇyănî, in a poetical and graphic manner which brings out clearly the uncanny sounds heard in the solitudes, the many beasts which abound, and the food which is raised without tillage. It is easy from this hymn alone to realize how spirits of dangerous character could, independently of any connexion with spirits of the dead, be deemed to abound in the forest.

The deity of the field as Kṣetrasya Pati, ' lord of the field', in the Rigveda 1 is invoked to grant cattle and horses, and with sweetness to fill heaven and earth, the plants, and the waters. In another hymn a he is asked, along with Savitṛ, the Dawns, and Parjanya to bestow prosperity, and elsewhere it is said that worshippers are fain to have him as a neighbour. The full nature of the deity is made clear in the Gṛhya ritual,3 which prescribes offerings to him when the field is ploughed, and he is, it is clear, no more than the deity believed to be in the ploughed land. Similarly the Rigveda contains an invocation of Sita, the furrow, to grant rich blessings and crops." The figure of this goddess naturally has more life in the Sutras, which deal with the operations of agri- culture: she appears as the wife of Indra, which may be due to the fact that in the Rigveda' the god is once called Urvarapati, lord of the plough field,' and her existence is manifested in the four Sondergötter, the deities Sītā, Āśā, Araḍā, and Anaghã, who are to be worshipped at the furrow sacrifice, the threshing-floor sacrifice, the sowing of the crop, and the reaping and the putting the crop into the barn. In another Sūtra 

In another Sūtra we have, beside the offering to Sītā and to three other deities, Yajā, Çamā, and Bhūti, who are less concrete than is she, offerings to the guardians of the furrow on the four sides; these guardians are called various names which are hardly more than epithets, 'having good bows and quivers', on the east, 'not winking the eyes' and 'wearing armour', on the south, prosperity', 'earth', Pārṣṇi, Çunamkuri, on the west, and 'those that are terrible' and 'like Vāyu in swiftness', on the north.10 These figures are interesting: they cannot properly in any sense be classified with abstract deities, even if that class of deities can properly be set up: they are not personifications of human activities or feelings, but they are the deities involved in the operations of nature, Sonder- götter, who live in the growth of the crop and may best perhaps be called animatistic spirits of vegetation, whose precise differentiation of character may plausibly be ascribed as in the case of the Roman Indigitamenta to the work of the priests. On the other hand Sitā has always a more elevated character than the rest of such spirits: she is called Săvitrī in the Taittiriya Brāhmaṇa,11 and she becomes the heroine of the Rāmāyaṇa, and the model of wifely truth and chastity, preserving none the less here and there traces

of her connexion with the furrow and the fruitful earth. Urvară, the plough field, is also a goddess in the Sütra literature, and is described as having a garland of threshing floors. It would of course be absurd to suppose that these scanty remnants of worship represent the whole of the agricultural side of Vedic religion, and as a matter of fact in the ritual there are abundant traces of other ceremonies having to do with agriculture, but the deities of the field were evidently as such not of great importance in Vedic religion, the care of the prosperity of men in these respects having been taken over by the great gods. When agricultural and vegetation spirits as such have great honour among and importance in the ideas of a people, then their figures are elevated to the rank of the great deities, as is the case with Attis, Adonis, or perhaps even Osiris in the lands of Asia Minor and of Egypt, and the fact that other deities are the great gods of Vedic religion cannot be explained on any other hypothesis than that the specific religious instinct of the Vedic people chose these forms as the favourite objects of its devotions. Curiously enough, the later religion of India gives a picture of the differences of religious predilection: the young Kṛṣṇa is represented as opposed to the worship of Indra by the pastoral world: he prefers instead that they should worship the mountains, their cattle, and the woods, just as ploughmen worship the furrow. In cases like these it is impossible not to observe a definite cleavage of religious sentiment, which it is perfectly legitimate to apply as a principle to Vedic religion. The theory which seems sometimes to be held that the Vedic litera- ture does not really give us the popular religion of the time cannot be supported, when it is applied to the literature as a whole, including the Sutras of the domestic ritual, which are packed with popular ideas and magic practices of every kind.

* 

The mountains are according to the young Kṛṣṇa essentially the deities of pastoral folk: the Rigveda, which shows no trace of the old belief of moun- tains as the home of the gods generally," also invokes here and there the mountains, nearly twenty times in the plural, and four times in the singular. They never, however, occur alone, but only with other deities such as Indra or Savitṛ, or with the waters, trees, plants, heaven and earth. They are described as rejoicing in the sacrificial offering and abiding securely. Parvata, 'the mountain ', is once found invoked as a companion of Indra in the dual compound Indraparvatā, and asked to come to the offering. In the ritual the mountains make but little appearance, but we hear in the Brāhmaṇas a good deal of a salve from the mountain Trikakubh which has wonderful powers,

and in the late Hiranyakeśi Gṛhya Sūtra1 there occurs an obscure phrase, which suggests that it was thought in applying the salve to the eyes that the spirit of the mountain entered into the performer of the rite. The idea is of course perfectly in harmony with primitive ideas.

## 5. Deities of the House 

2 

The deity of the house and the home is Văstospati, ‘lord of the dwelling', who is invoked in one short hymn of the Rigveda to bless man and beast, to remove diseases, to make cattle and horses prosper, to afford protection, and to grant a favourable entry. He is elsewhere described as destroyer of diseases, is identified with Soma, brought into close connexion with Tvaṣṭr as an artificer, or again he is likened to Indra as a cuirass of Soma pressers. In the late tenth book 3 he appears as an observer of ordinances, who was fashioned by the gods along with prayer. His character is made more clear by the fact that the Gṛhya Sūtras prescribe that offerings are to be made to him when a new house is entered. There is no possible ground for supposing that either Pūṣan," or Rudra, or Agni,” or any other god is designated by the title, though Rudra actually bears the style in one passage. The god is clearly the god of the house, who when a new house is built comes and abides in it. In the Sūtras' we hear more generally of deities of the house.

## 6. Divine Implements 

There is no very essential distinction between the worship of natural objects conceived as living and the worship of objects made by human hands, but it is obvious that the worship of such objects tends to be restricted in effect and importance. This is borne out by the evidence of Vedic religion where such religion is of very minor importance, despite the fact that it receives further attention in the Rigveda than might a priori have been expected. Thus we find there 10 that two implements of the ploughman, Çuna and Sira, which may be the ploughshare and the plough, are invoked, and that in the Çatapatha Brāhmana a cake is assigned to them in the sacrifice. The warrior invokes his arrow as divine," and begs it to protect him and assail his foes his armour, his bow and quiver, are also celebrated, and the drum is invoked to drive away the demons and the danger: in the Atharvaveda 1a a whole hymn is devoted to its praises. But the priest naturally is more

prominent in the Rigveda, where not only the sacrificial post is deified, perhaps as a remnant of tree worship, is called divine, and is asked to allow the sacri- fice to go to the gods, but the sacrificial grass1 and the divine doors * are celebrated. The pressing stones have three hymns given up to them: they are unaging, immortal, more powerful than the heaven itself. They are com- pared to steeds or bulls, their sound in the pressing reaches the sky. They bestow wealth and offspring, driving away the demons. The mortar and pestle were deified also, and the Atharvaveda adds to the category various ladles and invents a great deity in the remnant of the sacrifice, the Ucchișţa. 

It is possible to draw a distinction between the cases of the deities of the plougher and the warrior, and those of the priest. In his case the presence of the deity at the sacrifice may be held to be the cause why the instruments of the sacrifice are treated with so much reverence, while in the former cases the reverence is not due to anything save the essentially valuable character of the objects, and the mystic powers which are deemed by man to lie within them. It is particularly easy to understand how the arrow or even the plough can be regarded as animate: the worship of the priestly implements would thus be rather more fetishistic in origin than real and direct worship of the implements for themselves, and this is perhaps the more accurate manner of considering the question." 

## 7. Divine Animals 

The place of animals in the Veda is restricted and of comparatively little importance so far as it concerns direct worship of animals, whether individuals or species, as distinct from the theriomorphism of gods who are not animal gods, and the use of animal fetishes. But the existence of these different ways, in which an animal may seem to be divine, renders it difficult in each case to say whether or not direct worship of animal is to be detected. 

Dadhikra or Dadhikrävan is the most famous of horses in the Rigveda where he is praised in four rather late hymns." He was, it is clear, especially famous among the Purus: his speed is extolled, he is compared to, and even directly identified with, the eagle. He is even described with epithets appro- priate to Agni as the swan dwelling in light, the Vasu in the air, the priest at the altar, the guest in the home. He is a hero who wins booty, and who per- vades the five tribes with his might, as Sürya the waters with his light. He is a gift to the Pürus of Mitra and Varuņa, and is invoked with Agni, with the Dawn, with the Aśvins, Sûrya, and other gods, but in such invocations he has the first place.

[Part II 

The name appears to mean ' he who scatters the curd', and from the name and his general divine appearance Roth 1 holds that he is none other than the sun in the form of a swift steed. With this agrees the fact that the sun is constantly associated with Ușas, that it is compared to or identified with a steed, and that it is said to be a bird. Bergaigne's 2 view that lightning is specially referred to may be supported by the swiftness ascribed to the steed, but it is not clear that the conception could possibly be explained, unless the sun were taken as meant. The alternative view of Ludwig,* Pischel,* and Oldenberg * sees in the steed a real horse, a famous race-horse, which won its fame by its swift pace, but this is to exaggerate beyond all possible measure the value attached by the Vedic Indians to the sport of horse-racing. 

6 

Hillebrandt, therefore, suggests, with much more plausibility, that the steed is divine as being the horse which was to be sacrificed at the end of the period of a year, during which the sacrificial horse for the horse sacrifice of the king was allowed to wander at pleasure, guarded by the king's sons and warriors, as a sign that his sovereignty was acknowledged on all sides. The suggestion is interesting and is correct, in so far as it is clear that the horse at the horse sacrifice was addressed in terms appropriate to divinity: it cannot seriously be doubted that for the time being the horse was considered as being in a sense divine, nor that in the offering the horse represented the embodi- ment of the sun. It is, therefore, probable that we have in the horse of the sacrifice a sun fetish,” and this being so we have support for the theory that Dadhikrāvan is the sun in horse shape, but we need not suppose that Dadhi- krävan in the hymns in question was actually the horse of the horse sacrifice : he is instead the theriomorphic form of the sun, which in the horse sacrifice is represented by a real horse. 

8 

The nature of Tārkṣya seems to be similar to that of Dadhikrävan: he is described in part in the same terms, as pervading the five tribes with his power, and his character as a steed is shown by his bearing the name Ariṣțanemi, 'whose fellies are uninjured.' From this epithet in the Yajurveda * a new entity Ariṣṭanemi is created and invoked along with Tārkṣya. He is in later Vedic texts once or twice called a bird, and this may be compared with the bird character of Garuda, who is beyond question the sun bird. It is difficult, therefore, to doubt that Tärkṣya is merely a form of the sun, conceived as a bird or horse: his name is possibly derived from the prince Tṛkṣi Träsadasyava

who is mentioned in the Rigveda,1 and naturally it has been suggested that he is a real horse deified.2 

Another horse is Paidva, who was given by the Aśvins to Pedu, is white, praiseworthy, and is compared to Indra and Bhaga, and called slayer of the dragon, conqueror invincible. All this will pass as a description of the sun horse. Even more certain is the sun nature of Etaśa: in the plural the word denotes often the horses of the sun, and in the singular it denotes the sun horse who draws the sun: in a curious legend Indra is said to have aided Etaśa in contest with the sun, perhaps by causing a wheel of the sun car to fall off: Etaśa picks it up and gives it to the sun, but now is able to take the lead of the sun, who finally, moved by the nobility of Etaśa, concedes to him the front place in his chariot. It would probably be idle to see in this more than a mythological fancy, but the nature of Etaśa is quite certain. 

: 

In these cases, and in those which have been noted above, there is no trace of direct worship of the horse as such, whether as an individual of special qualities or as a species. Nor is any such worship of the bull to be found as the sun and Agni are represented in the ritual by horse fetishes, so also in the ritual Indra and Rudra are represented rarely by bulls, and a bull plays an obscure part in the legend of Mudgala and his wife," which has been inter- preted in the most diverse ways and which is clearly without value for mytho- logy: the bull is the theriomorphic form of Indra, Dyaus, and more rarely of other gods. The cow is often the theriomorphic form of the rain cloud or the beams of dawn hence the many-coloured cows which yield all desires in heaven mentioned in the Atharvaveda," and the post-Vedic Kāmaduh, a wish- milking cow who dwells in the heaven of Indra. Iḍā and Aditi are also addressed as cows, and the gods are born of cows. But the actual worship of the cow as such is not found in the Rigveda: the most that can be said is that perhaps from her connexion with the Ida and Aditi the cow was becoming invested with sacred character: the term aghnyā, which is addressed to her, or used of her, sixteen times, denotes that she should not be killed, an idea which was not, however, the early idea. One great Vedic hero, Atithigva, has his name from his hospitable habit of slaying oxen or cows for guests; the tradition that beef was the proper food for guests prevailed throughout the Vedic age, and the eating of meat was never a general taboo, seeing that the great Vedic ritual authority Yäjñavalkya was credited with the dictum that he ate meat if it was in a certain condition, variously interpreted as coming

from the shoulder, or firm.1 The opposite doctrine of Ahinså which forbade the taking of life, even animal, is however reflected in many passages such as the declaration that he who eats beef is born again in earth as a man of evil fame, and the warnings of retribution in the next world which are offered to eaters of meat in this. Moreover, in the Atharvaveda♦ we find the express assertion of the sacred character of the cow, which points to that animal having become in itself an object of worship.

The goat is the animal which draws the car of Püṣan, and it may be that in some cases Pūșan was conceived in goat shape: it is also the name of the one-footed goat', Aja Ekapād, which seems to be the lightning: here and there it is conceived as Agni. The ass draws the car of the Aśvins. The boar is the theriomorphic form of the Maruts, Rudra, and Vṛtra: in the Brah- manas it also occurs as the form assumed by Prajapati when he raises the earth from the waters, which is the beginning of the boar incarnation of Viṣņu of the post-Vedic literature. The dog occurs in the two brindled dogs, Çabala, reminiscent of Kerberos, and Çyama of Yama, the god of the dead, who are called Sārameya, a name denoting descent from Sarama. This indicates, though it does not conclusively prove, that Sarama, who figures as the messenger of Indra in the myth of the Panis, was treated as a dog, and this tradition, which is not expressly set out in the Rigveda, is the account of the later texts and of Yāska, who calls her the bitch of the gods. In all these cases there is clearly either theriomorphism, or the natural association of animals with the gods on the model of the relation of man and the animals. This last fact explains in all probability the figure of the male ape Vṛṣākapi who causes trouble between Indra and Indrāṇī: the effort to find some deity behind the ape is of doubtful validity, though it has naturally been thought possible to connect him with the monkey god Hanumant, who has been explained plausibly as a god of the monsoon, rather than as a case of direct zoolatry. 

The case of the tortoise is by no means so simple as that of most of the animals. In the piling of the fire altar in the ritual a tortoise is built into the altar, where it is left as lord of the waters to continue its existence; 8 it is possible that here we have a trace of the reverence paid to the beast for itself, though it may be merely so treated as representing the waters. In the Çatapatha Brāhmaṇa, however, the tortoise is treated as the form assumed by Prajapati for creating all creatures, and this view is embodied by the later mythology in the tortoise incarnation of Visņu. The tortoise as Kaśyapa

appears also beside Prajapati in the Atharvaveda, and in the Aitareya Brahmana 2 it is said that Viśvakarman promised the earth to Kaśyapa. In these cases there is merely theriomorphism. Theriomorphism is also found in the case of demons, who are not seldom called mṛga, 'wild beast', and specific enemies are called Aurṇavabha, spider brood', and Urana, ram'. By far the most frequent case, however, is that of Vṛtra, who is called the serpent repeatedly: we find also Ahi, serpent', not merely identified with Vṛtra, but occasionally alone, when he is described exactly as Vṛtra is described, as encompassing or swallowing the waters, and defeated by Indra. From this conception arises that of several Ahis of whom he is the chief." The term is also applied to Agni, and one god, Ahi Budhnya, has no other name. Among the birds also theriomorphism is the normal explanation of their mention. The sun is essentially a bird, and is twice in the Rigveda called Garutmant, whence arises the sun bird Garuda of the latest Vedic period. The eagle is connected with Indra, and Indra seems, like Verethraghna in the Avesta and Odin in Germanic mythology, to have assumed an eagle shape: Agni is also an eagle, and Soma is often called a bird. 

5 

There are, however, some traces of real reverence of animals, more certain than that of the tortoise, and more direct in origin than that of the cow whose divinity is really on the growth in the Vedic period. Thus in the case of birds the Rigveda twice invokes a bird of omen to give auspicious signs: it relegates, however, the owl and the pigeon to the rank of the messengers of Yama, but it is reasonable in this case to suggest more direct reverence of a sort at an early period. It must, however, be admitted that this cannot be proved even in the later literature the owl is styled the messenger of the evil spirits, and the beast of prey, covered with blood, and the vulture, which preys on the dead, are called the messengers of Yama, or of Yama and Bhava. A bird king is Tārkṣya Vaipaśyata according to the Çatapatha Brāhmaṇa.” 

Direct worship is clear in the homage paid to the snakes at the beginning and the end of the rains when they are specially dangerous. Of this there is no trace whatever in the Rigveda: the only deity, as opposed to demon, is Ahi Budhnya and that his snake character was real, and not mere therio- morphism, is not suggested by anything we know of that deity. The demon Vṛtra was not a snake, but a natural phenomenon in origin, and the Rigveda does not propitiate him. But in the later Samhitās we do find the apotropaeic worship of the snakes set on a level with that of such beings as the Gandh- arvas. They are stated to be in earth, air, and heaven, and in one hymn of the Atharvaveda," which knows snake deities well, some individual snakes may

be referred to. In the Sûtras offerings are prescribed for the snakes of the three regions,1 they are washed, combed, presented with collyrium, ointment and garlands, and duly fed; they receive offerings along with gods, plants, and demons, and blood is poured out for them,3 a fact which brings them into conjunction with Rudra. It is only reasonable to recognize in this direct worship of the terrible snake, which is thus propitiated and honoured in the hope that it will stay away from the houses of those who show it respect. The feeling is common in modern India, and is a good case of a propitiation due to terror and awe rather than to loving admiration. It is possible that the mention of snakes of the air and the sky may have been aided by the concep- tion of the snake Vṛtra, but it may be due merely to the formalism of the ritual, and the constant tendency to spread every power over the three parts of the universe. Several names of great snakes are known to us, e. g. Takṣaka, and Arbuda Kādraveya is at once a snake-priest and a snake-king.

While the snakes are the most lasting and prominent instance of a worship intended in the main to avert danger, it is of course possible that the common ideas that the earth spirit takes the form of a snake, and that the soul of an ancestor lives on in a snake which is about the house, had something to do with the sacred character and kindly treatment of the snakes. There are other instances of a temporary propitiation of animals, which might else be harmful : thus the Kauśika Sūtra a tells of the making of offerings to ants, the white in the east, the black in the south, and so on: the ants are regarded, as we have seen, as important beasts in that they can find water everywhere, and in the myth they play the part of the means of depriving Viṣņu as the sacrifice of his head. If there are worms in a cow, an offering is made to worms, and similarly an offering may in a case of need be made to the king of the moles." These acts indeed are not precisely of the greatest importance: they merely amount to the recognition of the power of the animals to injure, and the desirability of making them a present to appease their will to work injury: the precise parallel is the practice in Greece of offering something to the flies to deter them from infesting the sacrifice. The case of the frogs, who seem in one hymn of the Rigveda to be treated as having power to send prosperity through the rain which marks their awakening from their slumber in the mud, is obscure. The frog often serves in the ritual as a representative of the cooling water, and therefore this case might be reduced to theriomorphism, but that is less likely.

It should be added that in the list of sacrifices given in the Yajurveda 1 we find some animal offerings to such entities as the bull-king and the tiger-king: these would be worth consideration onlyif it were possible to take seriously all the lists of offerings prescribed in these cases: considerations of common sense enable us to relegate many of them to the realms of priestly fancy.

## 8. Totemism 

The nature and meaning of totemism are so uncertain and ill defined that it would be necessary to examine the concept in detail, if it were not for the fact that, on any theory of totemism which does not reduce it to the worship of animals, there is no support for the view that that phenomenon is to be found in Vedic religion. The essential feature of a totemist community as conceived by S. Reinach, who is now its most consistent supporter, assumes that the men and women of that community conceive themselves severally to be related to some animal or plant or other thing, and that they normally treat that plant or animal with great care and respect, only on special occasions in the case of an animal or plant destroying it in the course of a formal meal, in which they enter into communion among themselves and with the god, through devouring the representative of the god: the species and not the mere animal being sacred, as soon as one animal is killed, another takes its place. To this conception of totemism the most value is attributed by Reinach because of his view that the domestication of animals and plants came about through this belief, which he traces to a hypertrophy of the same social instinct which allowed of the growth of human society by forbidding killing within the family and the clan. He does not regard it as primitive in totemism that the members of the totem group should regard the totem as an ancestor : this is in his view the sort of wrong explanation which is inevitably given by savages when asked to explain uses of which they do not know the real origin. 

5 

This theory of totemism in itself is open to the gravest doubts.1 but it is unnecessary to discuss it or the alternative views that totemism is derived from ancestor worship and metempsychosis, or is economic au fond, or Altgerm.

originates from the desire of the savage, at the time of puberty in connexion with the new birth which he then undergoes, to provide himself with a safe resting place 1 for the external soul, or from his ignorance of the true nature of conception, which is Sir J. Frazer's latest opinion on this subject. In the Vedic religion there is not a single case in which we can trace any totem clan which eats sacramentally the totem animal or plant, and, therefore, the most essential feature of totemism on Reinach's theory does not even begin to appear in the Veda. The only point on which there is anything to be gleaned from the Vedic literature is the question of descent from animals, or plants. The evidence is the following: the Rigveda 2 mentions among the tribes the names of the Matsyas, 'fishes ', Ajas, ' goats ', Çigrus,' horse radishes", and the names of Vedic families include Gotamas, which includes the base go, ' cow', Vatsas, calves', Çunakas, dogs', Kauśikas, owls', and Māṇḍūkeyas, 'descendants of Manduka (frog)'. The family of Kaśyapas bear the name tortoise, which as we have seen is occasionally a name of Prajāpati, or even an independent semi-divine animal. In a passage of the Çatapatha Brāhmaṇa3 where Prajapati appears as a tortoise, the remark is made that people say that all beings are the children of the tortoise. The last statement is so obviously due to the fact that Prajapati is the father of all beings, and that if he is also a tortoise, the tortoise is obviously the father of all beings too, that it cannot be considered seriously at all. Of the other cases, it is sufficient to remark that in not a single one of them have we even the hint of a tradition that the families claimed their origin from the animals mentioned: it is most probable that some of them may be nicknames given by their too candid friends, other again for causes which we cannot know, such as the prevalence of the thing mentioned (e. g. fish or horse radishes in the land) and so on.a 

Oldenberg * adduces some later evidence which is in itself irrelevant for the Vedic age, since he admits that in the case of the best instance of all, the rinces of Chota Nagpur who claim descent from a snake, the belief is pro- bably aboriginal. But what is adduced from the epic is of no value: the name Ikṣvāku, which is known in the Veda, of the line of princes is in sense sugar cane; Ṛkṣa, father of Saṁvaraṇa, a name found in the Rigveda," means bear, and Sagara's wife brought forth a cucumber in which were 60,000 sons. The value of such evidence is obviously minimal. Moreover, it must be remembered that such legends need have nothing whatever to do with totemism at all, but may simply belong to the very old idea which draws no

persistent or accurate distinction between men on the one hand, and animals on the other. Of such ideas there are remains not merely in the theriomor- phism of the gods, which is undeniable and clear, but also in such fictions as that of the genus man-tiger which is found from the Yajurveda 1 onwards, and which in post-epic religion has its classical example in the man-lion in- carnation of Viṣņu, but also in the Nagas, who are first so called in the Sutras, and who according to the later tradition were human beings in appearance but really serpents. This view is widely spread in later India and results in the solenın question being put to initiates into the Buddhist com- munity whether they were men or Nāgas, the latter kind of being being excluded from the privilege of becoming a member of the Sangha. 

2 

Oldenberg 3 has suggested that the existence of taboos in some cases may be due to totemism, and has instanced the wearing of an antelope skin by the Brahman pupil as sign of possibly the wearing of the skin of the divine animal. It is proper to note these cases, but in p›ne recorded in the Vedic ritual is there any trace of the conditions necessary to lend even a possibility of totemism, namely the existence of the totem community which observes the taboo, or the connexion of the animals whose skin is worn with the wearer, That the skin may have been worn in certain cases for magic purposes is perfectly possible without any element of totemism being visible or existing. 

Nor again is it possible to lay any stress on the argument that the occa- sional offering of food to animals in place of the sacrifice of animals points to totemism: the best known instances are the offerings made at the spit-ox ceremony to a bull, a cow, and a calf in place of Rudra, his consort, and Jayanta respectively instead of slaughtering an ox, and the similar rite at the Aṣṭakās. With these usages may be compared the legends, which seem to show that in the worship of the wolf-god Apollo at Sikyon an offering was made to wolves, regarded as in some degree the temporary incarnations of the god. But not much stress can be laid on the Indian cases, as they are recorded merely in Sutras, which show the influence of the desire to avoid animal offerings, partly no doubt for economy, partly perhaps on humanitarian grounds.

## 9. The Lesser Nature Goddesses 

Not one of the goddesses of the Rigveda, with the doubtful exception of the Dawn, can be said to be of any real importance. Sarasvati and Pṛthivï have already been mentioned: in the Sûtras Bhūmi also appears, but with little character of any kind, doubtless as a direct expression for the earth

goddess. The Rigveda 1 also celebrates Rātri, 'night', as the sister of the Dawn, and the daughter of heaven. But night is here conceived as the bright starlit night, which fills the valleys and the hills and drives away the darkness, keeping away the wolf and the thief. Night is also a few times invoked together with the dawn as joint goddesses, and their importance such as it is seems derived from her connexion with that goddess. 

4 

3 

Another goddess who is clearly connected with nature is Prśni, the mother of the Maruts, who is doubtless the storm cloud : the word is properly an adjective 'speckled', used of the bull, or the cow, and in the plural of the cows, which milk Soma for Indra. More interesting is the figure of Saraṇyü who occurs in a curious legend in the Rigveda, in which it is narrated that Tvastr made a wedding for his daughter, that at the news all the world came together, that during the wedding Saranyū disappeared, but not it seems until she had been married to Vivasvant, that the gods hid the immortal from mortals, and making one of like form they gave her to Vivasvant: it is added that Saraṇyu bore the two Aśvins when this happened and left two pairs behind her. Yäska tells us that she first bore the pair Yama and Yami, and then changed her form to that of a mare and ran away: Vivasvant in the form of a horse pursued, and then were born the Aśvins, while on the female of like form was born Manu Săvarṇi. The tale is a strange one, and may be compared with the legend of the Tilphossian Erinys, who bore in horse form the steed Areion; the two myths probably belong to the same order of ideas, but it is difficult to say what the origin of the conception should be taken to have been. The horse form of Saraṇyū does not occur in the Rigveda : it can only be inferred and we do not know from what source Yāska obtained the details of the legend: it may have been an old tradition or merely a specula- tion: moreover the idea may have been caused by nothing more than the conception of the Aśvins who may have been thought to have been in horse form, and not merely lords of horses, in which case the comparison with the Erinys must probably be given up. On the other hand, especially if the com- parison is held to be valid, the figure of Saraṇyu may be brought into connexion with the Dawn, or the sun-maiden, whose swift nature her name would then be a good expression, since it is essentially derived from the root, sṛ, 'run '. The verbal correspondence with Erinys cannot however be accepted as proved, as it is clearly contrary to the phonology. Such a view, which is defended by Bloomfield, is more plausible than the suggestion which connects Saraṇyü with the storm, and which, accepting the identity with Erinys, seeks to trace the character of the Erinyes to this conception. S. Reinach 3 again has traced

• Lang, Modern Mythology, pp. 65 ff. Feist (Kultur der Indogermanen, p. 343, n. 1) suggests connexion between Saraṇyü

and Erinys as loan words from another tongue. The conjecture is possible that the term Erinys did not originally belong to the horse goddess at all, but that she bore a name really corresponding to Saraṇyū, but later confused with Erinys. * Culles, Mythes et Religions, iv. 54–68.

in Europe an old horse goddess (originally totemistic), found in Arcadia, in the legend of Cloelia, and as Epona in Gaul.

There is another group of goddesses of whom it can safely be said that in the later Samhitas they are the deities of natural objects, though the Rigveda leaves their character wholly uncertain and unexplained. These are Rākā, who twice appears in the Rigveda 1 as a rich and bountiful goddess, with which her name, probably containing the root rā, 'give', accords; and Sinivāli, described as a sister of the gods, with broad hips, fair arms and fingers, who is begged to give children. She is invoked with Rākā, Sarasvati, and with Guñgū, who only occurs in this place.' These later Saṁhitãs, however, have a scheme under which Rākā is the full moon day, Anumati the day before full moon, Kuhů new moon, and Siniväli the day before new moon. Sinīvālī is also said by the Atharvaveda 3 to be the wife of Viṣņu. While it is true that the explanations are not given in the Rigveda and that, in the case of Anumati, the position given seems to be secondary, it is difficult to be certain as to the others, with whom may be connected the otherwise unknown Gungu. 

3 

6 

Possibly another deity who plays some part in the development of Vedic thought may be traced to a natural origin, namely Vac, 'speech'. In the Rigveda 5 she has a hymn in which she describes herself as accompanying all the gods, and supporting Mitra and Varuņa, Indra and Agni, and the Aśvins, and as bending the bow of Rudra against the unbeliever: she claims to have a place in the waters, in the sea, and to encompass all beings, while in another hymn she is styled the queen of the gods. In the Brāhmaṇas * she is specially famed in the legend of the purchase of the Soma from the Gandharvas by means of a woman, Văc taking that form to tempt the Gandharvas, as lovers of the sex, to surrender the Soma which they guard: she agrees, however, with the gods, before the transaction takes place, to return to them and does so when called upon. The goddess seems to have too much life and reality in the Rigveda to be a mere abstraction, and it is important perhaps that in the Naighanțuka she is ranked among the gods of the atmosphere. Therefore it is possible that thunder, which in the Nirukta appears as the Vac of the middle region, may be the starting-point of the goddess who naturally develops in connexion with human speech. 

8 

It is also possible that in Umã, who appears at the very end of the Vedic period proper as the wife of Rudra, we have a goddess of the mountain, as she

The Gods and Demons of the Veda 

[Part II 

is given the epithet Haimavati, and is recognized in the later mythology as the daughter of the mountain Himavant. On the other hand it must be re- membered that, as Rudra is essentially a god of the mountains in the Vedic texts, it was only natural that his wife should be made out to be from the mountains, and that, therefore, we may have to do here simply with the same principle of setting a female beside the god which gives us Indrāṇī, and the other wives of the gods, though it is tempting to see in Umã a form of the mother goddess of the Dravidians. 

A goddess who owes her nature to the actual sacrificial food is Iḍā,1 the offering of milk and butter which occurs several times in the Rigveda, and more often later. Like Aditi and more naturally, she is brought into connexion with the cow, and a cow is used in the ritual to represent her and Aditi, and addressed with her name. She bears the names butter-handed and butter- footed, which express clearly her nature, and she normally appears with the goddesses Sarasvati and Bhāratī. Agni is said to be her son, because of his birth from the place of the Iḍā, and a mortal man Purŭravas is called Aiļa,2 which seems to denote him as an offshoot from Iḍă. She is also connected in the Rigveda with Urvaśi, with Dadhikrävan, and with the Aśvins. She figures in the legend of Manu, who after the flood through her generated the human race, Iḍā being called his daughter. She is styled also the daughter of Mitra and Varuna. Bharati, who occurs with Iḍā, is clearly the offering (hotrā) of the Bharatas, a fact which accords with the importance of the Bharatas in cult. Iḍā, Sarasvati, and Bhārati are called in the Yajurveda the wives of Indra,' and in the Rigveda a goddess Bṛhaddivă, ‘of the broad sky', is mentioned with Iḍā, Sarasvati, and Rākā, but of her nature nothing more is known.8

## 10. Constellations and Time Periods 

There is a certain curious paucity of evidence of worship of constellations other than the sun and the moon, especially in its connexion with Soma," and the planets seem to have attracted little notice. Whether we believe or not that they were known to the Vedic Indians, at any rate it is obvious that they received no direct worship in the period of the Rigveda, and it is not until the close of the Vedic ritual that we have enumerations of them such as that of the Baudhāyana Dharma Sūtra,10 which gives in a late passage sun, moon, Añgāraka, Budha, Bṛhaspati, Çukra, Çanaiścara, Rāhu and Ketu.

influences, signified in the term Grahas, seizers ', applied to the planets, seem not to have troubled the imagination of the early Indians.1 

The Nakṣatras figure early in the myths of Soma and his marriage with them which is recorded in the later Samhitās and Brāhmaṇas, and in the ritual they receive occasional offerings, but appear to be of little religious con- sequence. The same consideration applies to the seasons, months and half months, the days and nights, and the year,3 or even the night of new moon, that is when the moon is invisible, or the night of full moon, or the period when the moon first appears (amāvāsyā, paurṇamāsi, darśa), though the latter three entities are honoured by Atharvan hymns. More personality is ac- corded to the moon phases, Anumati, Sinīvālī, Rākā, and Kuhû, which have already been denoted," and still more to Ekāṣṭakă, a lunar day near the beginning of the year, which is celebrated as being the daughter of Prajapati, and the mother of Indra. Such importance, however, as this or any other of the Aṣṭakās,' lunar days in the middle of th⚫ fortnight of declining moonlight, may possess, is doubtless really due to connexion with the offerings then made to the Fathers, whose connexion with the moon was doubtless strongly felt, since it is accepted as a dogma in the Upaniṣads.

In the domestic ritual we find the pole star, Dhruva, accorded a measure of respect, and similar honour is paid to the Seven Seers, that is the Great Bear, and Arundhati. The Seven Seers already receive in the Rigveda the credit of having in a time of trouble secured for Purukutsa's wife a son, Trasadasyu, but in their case we have unquestionably to do with the concep- tion of the souls of the dead entering into the stars. They are said to have settled in heaven to practice asceticism, and with the five Adhvaryus to guard the hidden footprint of the bird, and their relation with the seven Hotṛs on earth is obvious, whether it be that of prototypes or derivatives. The suggestion 10 that the five Adhvaryus denote the planets, because of the similarity of their movements to and fro may be deemed most implausible.

Possibly they are meant in HGS. i. 8. 10. 4, where Çaka may be connected with the mysterious Çakadhūma of the Athar- vaveda (vi. 128; SBE. xlii. 160, 532 ff.). * See above, Chap. 10, §8.

from the terminology that they are not the planets, and we may best suppose that they are the stars of some asterism, seen there by the Indian mind. 

Hillebrandt suggests that the pole star is to be found not merely in the Dhruva of the domestic ritual, but in the Aghnya to whose head the Aśvins are said to fasten one wheel of their chariot, while the other encircles the heaven, comparing the view of later times that the sun, moon, and stars are fastened to the pole star. An alternative view makes the inviolable one the sun, and it is clear that to assume the pole star in the absence of any other hint of its existence in the Rigveda is unwise. He treats Etaśa, who is usually regarded merely as the steed of the sun, as the morning and evening star, com- paring him to the later Aruna, who does not certainly appear in the Vedic literature. Other efforts have been made to discover the Pleiades 3 and the Milky Way as well as other stars in various mythological figures, but without marked plausibility.
