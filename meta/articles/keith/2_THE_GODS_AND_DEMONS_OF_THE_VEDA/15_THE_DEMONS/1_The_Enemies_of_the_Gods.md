title = "1 The Enemies of the Gods"

+++

THE enemies of the gods par excellence throughout the Yajurveda, the Atharvaveda, and all the subsequent Vedic literature are beings called Asuras, but this connexion can be traced only in the latest parts of the Rigveda and even there but occasionally. In the singular the meaning is found but three times certainly, used of Varcin,1 Pipru,2 and the wolfish Asura; 3 a fourth case is very doubtful, and may instead refer to Varuna. In the plural there are at most eight cases, predominantly in the tenth book: in them the gods as a body appear opposed to the Asuras as in the later texts, or Indra scatters them. The term Asura is applied also to Namuci, and to Svarbhānu, while Indra, Agni, and the sun are called slayers of Asuras. In the Atharvaveda," on the other hand, the singular is used in the hostile sense three times, the plural thirty times, and the application of the term to the gods, which is found very occasionally in the later literature," is confronted with a regular applica- tion to the enemies of the gods. In the Rigveda, on the contrary, it is the normal attribute of Varuņa and, more rarely, of other high gods.

The theory of Haug that the change of meaning of Asura as between Asura in India and Ahura Mazdāh in Iran was due to a divergence in religion in the Indo-Iranian people, which ended in the schism of the two nations, is hopelessly opposed to the fact that the change of meaning takes place in India itself, and, since Darmesteter, the theory has prevailed that the change by which Asura became the name of demons in India, while in Iran the Devas became demons, is an internal change of meaning in the two languages, brought about by causes which can be made more or less clear. In the case of India the development of Asura into a hostile sense is traced to its use in connexion with the word Māyā, ' wile ' 1o or 'occult power', assisted by the

popular derivation which saw a negative in the first letter of the word, and vaguely conceived the meaning as 'not heavenly, this view leading to the creation of the term sura for god in the Upaniṣads, and perhaps also by the absence of any collective name for the enemies of the gods proper. The change of Deva was by Darmesteter attributed to the misunderstanding under the régime of Zoroaster of the old phrases 'wrath of gods and men', and 'trouble made by gods or men', but this argument is of very problematic value indeed. 

Hillebrandt has recently opposed the prevalent doctrine, and asserted the opinion that the difference of view is due to religious relations with the early Iranians before the reform of Zoroaster, but after the period of the Rigveda in its main portions. He points out that the real cleavage in view is considerable that the fall of the Nasatya, Indra, Vāta, and Çarva to be demons as Nãonhaithya, Indra, Vato, and Çauru (Saurva) is significant; that the Vedic Kavis and the Uśij family of priests fell in rank; and that there is no trace of the gradual change of sense, which would be expected, if the prevailing view were correct. He also points to the fact that 

the names among of Asuras, who appear in the accounts of the Brāhmaṇas, there are some with an Iranian aspect namely Çanda and Marka, the latter being Avestan Mahrka,2 Kavya Uśanã, who is comparable with Kai Kãos, Prahrāda Kāyā- dhava, perhaps Avestan Kayadha, and Sṛma, Iranian Salm, son of Thraë- taona. The evidence is, however, clearly inadequate to prove the thesis, and the efforts of Hillebrandt to show that in the Rigveda occur names of Persian princes who patronized the singers, a fact which would indicate the possibility of close intercourse during the late Rigveda period natural, must be definitely taken to have failed to produce conviction."

Another suggestion is made by von Schroeder, based on von Bradke's view of the term Asura, as applied to the gods, as meaning not 'spirit' as usually held, but 'master or 'lord', and cognate with Latin erus. The name would thus normally have applied specifically to Dyaus, as the great sky god, or rather the god created by the moral sense of men, and also regarded as a nature deity, but as usual with the Vedic poets would have been extended

Hillebrandt treats him as Death; these demons receive the Çukra and Manthin cups at the Agniṣțoma, in- vented by the gods to rid themselves of them, and the Manthin cup brings dis- ease. Çandikas in RV. ii, 30. 8 are foes of Indra. The Avestan Karapans who 

are in evil odour he connects with the kalpa of the Vedic priests.

It is note- worthy that Bloomfield's evidence (Rig- Veda Repetitions, p. 645) shows book vi as by no means early as it should be if it deals with events in Iran before the invasion of India.

by henotheism to other gods, such as Varuņa, Parjanya, Indra, Agni, and Savitṛ. The degradation of such a term seems unlikely, and accordingly von Schroeder believes that there originally existed two distinct words, asura, ‘lord', and asura, ' spirit'. In India the latter use prevailed, and the older or contemporaneous asura, 'lord', was given up, because perhaps of risk of confusion with the other term, while the Iranians retained the use of Ahura as ' master'. This suggestion is ingenious, but purely hypothetical, and hardly necessary to explain the facts. Moreover, the idea that asura as 'spirit' is naturally applied to evil beings is decidedly fantastic. The precise sense which asura had in the minds of those who used it is unknown to us, but there is nothing to show that it had any connexion with the worship of the spirits of the dead, as frequently suggested.1 On the contrary, even from its possible connexion with asu,' breath', the word may rather have meant that which is essentially alive and possessed of power and strength."

The view of these personages taken by the Brahmaṇas is that they are equally sons of Prajapati, though born of a less worthy part of the god, from the descending breath, not the mouth, and that they are in constant conflict with the gods, and have to be defeated by some ritual performances. They are associated with the darkness, untruth, and error, as opposed to the gods. The term 'pertaining to the Asuras' is freely given to any ritual performance which the priests do not approve. Thus the Asuras are said to have only a morning and afternoon pressing, not three as the Vedic Indians, a point which has some affinity to the Avesta, and the mode of making the grave differs.* We have one fairly clear proof that Aryan enemies are included, for the Çatapatha Brahmaṇa 5 has preserved to us two barbarous (mleccha) words used by the Asuras, he 'lavo, which, despite various efforts to interpret them as Assyrian or something equally implausible, seem merely a Prākritic version of the Vedic he 'rayaḥ, ‘O enemies', pointing to an eastern dialect as in Māgadhi.

Among names of Asuras we learn of Kirata and Akuli, Araru (with which may be compared the Arurmaghas or Aruñmaghas, foes of Indra), Aru, Kustā,” in opposition to Aditi, Etadu, from the use of etad u in a formula, Daivya as their messenger as opposed to Agni, Dābhi as the address of the Gayatri 

1 Thus Moulton (Early Zoroastrianism, p. 150; Early Rel. Poetry of Persia, pp. 34 ff.) argues that the high Ahura wor- ship comes from ancestor worship as contrasted with the inferior worship of Daëvas, nature deities. But he himself (Early Zoroastrianism, pp. ix, 344, &c.) renders Ahura by' lord', which disposes of any connexion with ancestor worship. Varuna sufficiently refutes for India and Ahura for Iran Schroeder's doctrine that morality and ancestor worship are more closely related than the worship 

of the gods and conduct. 

* Cf. Oldenberg, Rel. des Veda', p. 160, n. 2. On the whole, the sense 'lord' seems adequate for Veda and Avesta alike. On the Gaulish Esus, see Rhys, Celtic Heathendom, pp. 60 ff.

metre,1 in place of Viśvakarman, Asita Dhanva, their king,2 Pūru, the name of a Vedic prince, Vibhinduka and Viṣād. More important are the Kala- kañjas,3 who figure in a story similar to that of Otos and Ephialtes, the bricks of the altar taking the place of mountains. 

In comparison with the Asuras the Panis are unimportant demons, who play no great part in the literature after the Rigveda. They are the demons who withhold the cows, or, as it is differently put, the ghee in the cow, from Indra or his allies, Agni, Bṛhaspati, the Añgirases or Soma, and are over- thrown by him. The word is normally plural, but a single Pani four times represents the group. The most probable explanation is undoubtedly that which sees in the Panis the personification of the enemy, who will not sacrifice to the gods or bestow gifts on the priests, and who is therefore an enemy of the gods and men alike, and has been brought into the old myth of the winning of the light in cow shape. Hillebrandt seeks to show that the Panis are an historical tribe, comparing the name Parnians, but the suggestion is most improbable.

The Dāsas or Dasyus are also made into enemies of the gods, though, like the Panis, their primitive function was doubtless different; in their case it probably was that of aborigines, who opposed the Aryan advance, though Hillebrandt changes them into Dahae. That in many cases historic men may be meant when Dāsas are overthrown, is true; but gods of the defeated aborigines may also be denoted, and more generally powers of the air opposed to the gods: Dasyus seek to scale heaven,? Indra vanquishes them from birth,8 he wins the sun and waters after defeating them, a Dasa is husband of the waters, 10 and the Dāsas have seven autumnal forts, doubtless in the air, not on the steppes. 

Of the individual names of the enemies of the gods Vṛtra ranks first; he is a serpent with power over the lightning, mist, hail, and thunder, when he wars with Indra; his mother is Dânu, apparently the stream or the waters of heaven, but he bears that name himself as well as Danava, offspring of Dănu. His abode is hidden in the waters, but is also on a summit or on lofty heights, which suggest the waters of the air. He is by name the encompasser of the waters, rather than the holder back by congealing them: the cloud mountain is, therefore, said to be within his belly. He has ninety-nine forts which Indra shatters as he slays him. From the single Vṛtra the Vedic conception, as often, produces many Vṛtras, and we find also the plural used of foes who must be clearly human, perhaps, however, never without a sub-reference to Vṛtra, though, as the neuter is used in this way, it may be that the use is not simply a direct generalization of Vṛtra as a demon.

tales about Vṛtra,1 make him out to be the moon, swallowed at new moon by Indra as the sun. 

Vala is a pale figure compared to Vṛtra: he is mentioned in the myth of the Panis: Bṛhaspati or Indra takes from him the cows which he had in his forts, his fences are burst by Indra, or his hole is opened. The word means literally covering, and is found often in this sense or in some cognate meaning. The fold of Vala is also mentioned, and he is clearly simply the personification of the pen in which the cows are supposed to be kept, as is indicated by the fact that he is not said to be slain, but to be pierced, broken, or cloven. In the post-Vedic mythology he appears in the epithet of Indra, piercer of Vala ', and is deemed brother of Vṛtra, with whose myth, however, he had, it is clear, little originally to do."

Arbuda appears seven times as a beast whose head Indra struck off: he seems to be cognate to Vṛtra with whom or Ahi he is mentioned. Svarbhānu,* the Asura, is more interesting: he is clearly the demon who eclipses the sun, and who has to be overthrown by Atri or the Atris, and by Indra. Though he is several times mentioned in the Brāhmaṇas, his place is in post-Vedic mythology regularly taken by Rahu. The Atharvaveda 5 also knows of Grahas who affect the moon. Of Urana who had ninety-nine arms we know no more. But we hear a good deal of Viśvarupa, the three-headed son of Tvaṣtṛ, slain by Trita and by Indra for the sake of his cows, and who in the Brāhmaṇas' appears as the Purohita of the gods, though akin to the Asuras. Tvastr, it is said, sought to punish Indra for the death of his son, but his effort to exclude him from the Soma sacrifice was defeated by Indra, who insisted on taking a share in it. The legend tells also of the origin of three birds from the three heads of the demon, as they were struck off by Indra, and explains the use of each of the three heads for drinking respectively the Soma, the Surā, and taking other forms of nourishment. To Hillebrandt 9 the moon seems to be meant by this form, and he lays just stress on the fact that the Brāhmaṇas are aware of the hostile character of the moon, which they often equate with Vṛtra, and which seems once regarded in a hostile light in the Rigveda; but this view cannot be regarded as probable as that which insists on the identity of the legend with those of Herakles and Geryoneus and Hercules and Cacus.10 

Hillebrandt, Ved. Myth, iii, 289 ff. Use- 

ner (Götternamen, p. 206) finds the Danaoi in the Dānava as demons, de- spite the change of quantity. Implau- sible is the view that Vṛtra is a creation of the imagination, vṛtrahan, as in the Avesta Verethraghna, denoting * assault repelling '(Bartholomae, Air.Wb. 1420).

[Part II 

Of the Dasa enemies of Indra the chief is Çambara, the son of Kulitara,1 who had 90, 99, or 100 forts and was the great foe of Divodāsa Atithigva. His historical reality seems reasonably assumed. Pipru is styled a wild beast, an Asura, and a Dāsa, and is defeated for the sake of Ṛjiśvan: it seems unneces- sary to see in him a spirit of the air. Dhuni, the roarer, and Cumuri, whose name is not connected with any known root, are apparently chiefs defeated for Dabhiti. Varcin is both Asura and Dasa, but his 1,100 or 100,000 4 warriors do not seem wholly mythical, and the names Anarśani, Ilībiśa, Drbhika, Rudhikrā, and Sṛbinda, which are those of other foes, seem human enough. On the other hand, Namuci, as we have seen, seems to be a demon, and Çuṣna has been explained not as a human enemy of Kutsa, but as a demon of drought from his name interpreted as scorcher." But this seems unlikely : he is child of the mist and moves in the water and a Danava; if, therefore, he is a demon, he is rather the hisser, for Vṛtra's hissing drove Indra away in fear, and this applies to other enemies than drought demons.
