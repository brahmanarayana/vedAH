Of the warriors who are mentioned as having been engaged in battles and aided by the gods, we have absolutely no reason to assign the majority to any but the world of past reality. Historic reminiscence and poetic imagination are sufficient to account for what is said about them, just as the same factors together with aetiological myths explain adequately the legends of the priest of old days. To seek in any of them gods is erroneous: 1 treated as history, it is perfectly possible to make good sense out of the history of Sudās, and even of the older and more mystic Divodāsa Atithigva. With Sudās Viśvāmitra and Vasiṣṭha stand in the closest relation: we have a poem which tradition places in the mouth of Viśvamitra extolling the rivers Vipaś and Cutudri for giving an easy crossing to his master's hosts, and another hymn recounts with jeers at the expense of Viśvamitra the failure of the great coalition which he had brought against his former master, and the success of the army of Sudās through the help of Vasiṣṭha. 

The other heroes are of less consequence except Kutsa," who is important for the part played by him in connexion with Indra. In order to assist Kutsa to overthrow Śuṣṇa, Indra tore off one wheel of the sun, and gave the other to him to drive on with. The mythic element seems merely to be the introduction of this deed of Indra; as Indra defeated for him Smadibha, Tugra, and the Vetasus, and on the other hand defeats for Tūrvayāṇa Kutsa, Āyu, and Atithigva, it seems most probable that Kutsa is a real enough prince. Ber- gaigne sees in him, as too often, a figure of Agni, and the Naighanṭuka" includes his name among the synonyms of the thunderbolt.
