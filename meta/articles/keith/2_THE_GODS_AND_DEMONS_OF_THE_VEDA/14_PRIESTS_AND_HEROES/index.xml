      <description>WITH the cult of fire are connected three great families of priests, the Añgirases, the Atharvans, and Bhṛgus, in all of whose cases it is at first sight impossible, and in any case difficult, to decide whether we have to do with real traditions of priestly families of the past, or with deities who have fallen in rank and become confounded with men. The case of the Añgirases is of special interest.</description>

Of other ancient seers the most famous are the Seven Seers, who are four times mentioned in the Rigveda. They are called divine fathers and secure Trasadasyu for Purukutsa&amp;rsquo;s wife in her dire need; possibly the number is merely the frequent mystic number seven, or again it may be derived from the seven priests of the ritual who again, however, may be due to the desire to make up the sacred number.</description>

      <title>3 Warriors</title>

      <description>Of the warriors who are mentioned as having been engaged in battles and aided by the gods, we have absolutely no reason to assign the majority to any but the world of past reality. Historic reminiscence and poetic imagination are sufficient to account for what is said about them, just as the same factors together with aetiological myths explain adequately the legends of the priest of old days. To seek in any of them gods is erroneous: 1 treated as history, it is perfectly possible to make good sense out of the history of Sudās, and even of the older and more mystic Divodāsa Atithigva.</description>

      <description>In the Rigveda there can be no doubt as to who is the real first man: it is Manu or Manus, whose name, cognate perhaps with the Gothic manna, and the root man, &amp;rsquo;think&amp;rsquo;, appears as a definite forefather of men nearly forty times in the Rigveda. He is essentially the first of sacrificers, and the establisher of sacrifice, though he appears with other old sacrificers also, Añgiras, Bhṛgu, Atharvan, Dadhyañc, Atri, and Kaṇva.</description>
