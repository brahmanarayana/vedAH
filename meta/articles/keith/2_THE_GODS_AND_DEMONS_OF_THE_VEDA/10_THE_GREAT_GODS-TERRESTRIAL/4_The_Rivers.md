It is perhaps doubtful whether the rivers can claim to be regarded as among the great gods of the Rigveda, but their importance in the mind of the Vedic Indians was perhaps sufficient to justify their treatment in this place. One whole long hymn 3 is accorded to the Sarasvati, and in two verses of it are enumerated her tributaries and other affluents, while the Vipãś and Śutudri claim another hymn 4 of some poetical beauty.

is the Sarasvati, which has in all three hymns devoted to it: she flows from the mountains, tearing them down; she has seven sisters and is mother of streams: she is daughter of the lightning (pāviravi) and has a spouse, who later is called Sarasvant. She is divine, she comes with the Fathers to the sacrifice, and is stated to be descended from the sky, an early anticipation of the com- mon Indian belief of the divine birth of the Ganges. She has other and more intimate connexions with human life: she bestows progeny, wealth, and im- mortality, she gave Vadhryaśva a son; she is terrible and a Vṛtra-slayer, but to her worshippers a protector. 

Sarasvati is connected with Indra and with Puṣan, but in the main with the Aśvins: she takes part in the rite by which they heal Indra, and she is spoken of in the Yajurveda 1 as the wife of the Aśvins. She forms also one of the triad of goddesses Bhārati, Iḍā, and Sarasvati, or Mahi, Hotrā, and Sarasvati, who are invoked in the Apri hymns of the animal sacrifice: Iḍā is a mere abstraction of the idea of the sacrificial offering, and Mahï and Hotrā are clearly deities of the same kind: Bharati, however, must refer to the lady of the Bharatas, and the identification is of first-rate importance as it enables us to decide which Sarasvati is meant in these cases. The Bharatas, we know, dwelt on the Sarasvati and the Dṛṣadvatī, and sacrifices on the Sarasvati are prescribed in the Brahmanas and the Sūtras: the combination of the god- desses must have grown up when Sarasvati meant the stream which is connected with the Drṣadvati. Nor is it at all improbable that the same river is meant in every or nearly every case: the older view 3 that Sarasvati meant the Indus, or the view that in any case it refers still as originally to the Harahvaiti cannot be supported by any conclusive proof it is true that the present river Sarasvati is small, and loses itself in the sand, but it may well have been more important than this in the time of the Rigveda, and in any case there is no doubt of its holiness in the Brāhmaṇa period, a fact which really disposes of the argument against it, based on its size. 

In the Rigveda in Sarasvati we need not see anything more than a river goddess somewhat strongly anthropomorphized in certain details who inspires prayers of devotion. But in the Brāhmaṇas she is connected with speech, perhaps because Vedic culture and poetry flourished specially there, and in the post-Vedic literature she is the goddess of eloquence and the wife of Brahman. The nearest approach to this is the statement of the Yajurveda " that, when Indra was ill, Sarasvati by speech communicated vigour to him, where speech

• Hillebrandt, Ved. Myth. i. 99 ; iii. 874 ff. He takes the celestial Sarasvati as the milky way (i. 882, 889). Carnoy (Les Indo-Européens, p. 199) compares Anā- hita in Iran and suggests borrowing 

from the Babylonian Nin Ella, mother of waters.

is merely her instrument, not her nature, and her healing power must rather be deemed to be due to her nature as the purifying water. 

Beside Sarasvati in one hymn 1 we have an invocation of Sarasvant to give offspring, protection, and plenty: his fertilizing waters and breast are referred to. Agni as Sarasvant once appears as a giver of rain. It is hardly necessary to see in him more than a male counterpart of Sarasvati: there is nothing to support the more important character of guardian of the celestial waters which is accorded to him by Roth or the identification with Apāṁ Napat proposed by Hillebrandt and Hardy."

Other streams are addressed as great, such as Sarayu and Sindhu, and the conception of seven streams is particularly often found, doubtless because of the Vedic predilection for the number seven. It is probably needless to press the number for an exact identification, especially as it is quite probable the idea came with the Indians from Iran.*
