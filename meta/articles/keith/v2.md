CHAPTER 20   

THE SACRIFICES OF THE RAUTA RITUAL 

1. General Characteristics 

THE rites of the frauta ritual have much essentially in common, in addition to the necessity of the use of the three or one at least of the three fires in place of the domestic fire. They necessitate the presenceof priests numberingfrom one up to sixteen, or with the Kausitakins seventeen,1 to whom should be added the actual performersof some of the minor actions in the more compli cated forms of the ritual, whose number is not defined, and whose menial functions rendered them of no consequencein the eyesof the priests of the higher rank. It is obvious, for instance, that in the slaughteringof the victims there must often have been need for other aid than that of the Adhvaryu andhis assistants proper, and the amitrs are occasionally referred to as charged with the actual slaying: more often a general term like servant is used to apply to such helpers. 

As a result of the constant developmentof the ritual, the festivals of the frauta type are full of details which are of no consequence with regardto the meaning of the sacrifice : practicallyin no case is an importantrite addressed to one god only : the effort on the contrary was clearly to find as much room

as possible for as many gods as possible. We find, too, many variations among the details of the rites, of which but a few can be reduced to any simple principle. Thus we know that some families like the Jamadagnis and the Bhrgus made five divisions or layers of the offerings, while other familiesa 

made but four, whence the former are called pancdvattins, and the latter caturavattins. Another distinction which has more religious value is the differences between families based on the distinction of the use of Tanunapator Naraaftsa, as one of the deities invoked at the AprI litanies of the animal sacrifice,8 while the difference of dressing the hair is also of interest from the point of view of social usages,4 having many parallels in other lands. 

In the Sutras the principleis laid down that the sacrifices are to be dis tinguished as Prakrtis and Vikrtis, the former being the base on which the later are built up ; thus the new- and full-moon sacrifices are the model for 

other sacrifices of the type known as Isti, and for the animal sacrifice, in its form as an offering to Agni and Soma, on which further animal offerings are based. The Agnistoma again is the fundamental form of the Soma sacrifice : 

1 See Keith, Rig-Veda Br&hmanas, pp. 48,3 Weber, Ind. Stud. x. 89 ff. 498, n. 1.4 Zimmer, Altind. Leben, p. 264; Hille- * KfS. i. 9. 8 ; Eggeling, SBE. xii. 192. brandt, Rituallitteratur, pp. 7, 8.

on it are based other performances up totheDvada$aha inclusive, while on the latter are based the Sattras. Each sacrifice is divided into Pradhanas, the characteristics which mark it out as a special offering, and Angas, the auxiliary parts which are common to many sacrifices, and which build the framework, 

Tantra, which serves to maintain the sacrifice. The distinction between the Yajatayas and the Juhotayas, the latter managed by the Adhvaryu alone andaccompanied by the mere utterance of the word Svaha,*hail ',l has already been noted. 

In the Soma offering there is added the complicationsof the recitation of the Samans. The rule is that the Saman is a melody, which is performed ona verse of the Rigveda, and the verses can be sung to different melodies, for which purpose they have to be eked out by the addition of letters, or even of whole syllables, which have themselves no meaning, and of which as many as fifteen are enumerated.2 The nature of the tunes must have been varied in the extreme, to judge from the many names recorded, of which the Brhat and the Rathantara are the most notorious, but the nature of Indian music is anunsolved problem, and perhapsinsoluble.3 Seven notes are mentioned, buttheir significance is much disputed. Each Saman is divided into parts, the most usual being that into Prastava, introduced by ths word hum (hunkdra), sung by the Prastotr, the Udgitha, introduced by om, sung by the Udgatr, the Pratihara, introduced by hum, sung by the Pratihartr, and the Nidhana, or finale, sung by all together. In some cases the Pratihara is divided into twoparts, the latter, theUpadrava, being sung by the Udgatr, or the Hinkara is made into a separateelement. Moreover there are Upagatrs,three in number,who accompany the song with the word ho. The contempt which throughthe Indian literature is more or less clearly shown for Saman singersis justified bythe extraordinary stupidity of the position assigned to them* 

The singing of more than one verse on a tune is a Stotra, which usually is made up of a triplet or a Pragatha, a double verse, which is made into three for recitation purposes. From the Stotras are built up the Stomas, or forms of chanting Stotras. Of these there are many varieties. The simplestin someways is the Trivrt, which is the first used in the Agnistoma : it consists of nine verses, which can be variously arrangedin sets of three, either as adg, beh, cfi, which is the Udyati form, or abc, def, ghi, the Parivartini, and abc, efd, igh, the Kulayim. On the other hand the other Stomas, the Paftcada9a, Saptada$a> Ekavi&a, which with the Trivrt are the main Stomas of the Agnistoma, andothers such as the Paficavii^a, Trinava, Trayastrifcga, Caturvin9a, Catucat varififa, and Astacatvariftga, are all based on three verses or a Pragatha madeinto three. The numbers of the Stomas are derived from the number of verses which are used : thus the Paficada?a in one form is made up of aaabc, abbbc,

and dbccc, the Hinkara being said before each set of three similar verses* Further complicationswill be noted later on. 

Before the Stotras can be performed the singers must obtain the approval of the Brahman and the Maitravararia, who giveit with the words om stuta, the Brahman saying also one of the Stomabhagas, certain formulae provided for the purpose. The Stotra is followed by a Qastra, a recitation of the Hotror his fellows, the signalfor it being given by the performerof the Stotra saying esd, 'this is the last verse.' The Hotr asks the Adhvaryu if he is to recite, the latter agrees. But at the morning litany in front of this dialogue are placed certain syllables, and a muttered prayerto Matari^van and the Kavis. This is followed by the silent praise, Tusmmjapa, and by the Puroruc, 4 that which shines before ', but in the midday and evening Qastras the place of the Puroruc is taken by Nivids, which are inserted in the hymns of the 

astra. The Nivids are introduced by the procedure of asking the Adhvaryu's authority to recite, but this formality is omitted in the case of the Puroruc at the first fastra in the morning : at the second astra, on the other hand, wefind seven Purorucs preceded by the dialogueof Hotr and Adhvaryu, andfollowed by a triplet. In the case of the midday astras there are further complications. In the first astra of the midday .and the evening pressings there are found sets of three verses called Pratipad and Anucara, which are preceded by the usual dialogue ; then comes in the case of the midday astra, the Maruta astra, a Pragatha addressed to Indra, which is recited as three verses, the last part of each verse being repeated with the first of the next : thus the Pragatha, which consists of a Brhati* and Satobrhati2 or Kakubh 8 and Satobrhati, is made into a Brhati and two Kakubh verses. This is followed by a Pragatha for Brhaspati, Dhayyas, supplementary verses, a Pragatha for the Maruts, the hymn in which the Nivid is inserted, the Ukthavirya formula, and then as in the other astras come the offering verse and the libation. In the case of the second astra of the midday and evening pressings, and all the fastras of the assistants of the Hotr, the Hotrakas, the same sort of beginning is prescribed, but the verses are called Stotriya andAnurupa, names which refer to the fact that they follow the strophe andantistrophe of the correspondingStotra of the Saman singers, which obey the rule that the Anurupa,4corresponding verse ', should follow the Stotriya in metre, number of syllables, and deity. As usual the rule is obeyed that the twoverses of the Stotriya are made into three in recitation, and so with the Anurupa. Then in the second fastra of the midday pressing, the Niskevalya, come Dhayyas, a Samapragatha, the hymn with the Nivid, the Ukthavirya and the offering verse with the libation. 

In the first astra of the evening pressing, the Vai?vadeva, the Pratipad and Anucara are followed by a hymn with a Nivid, then a verse for V&yu, then a hymn with a Nivid to sky and earth, a hymn with a Nivid for the

Rbhus, three isolated verses, and a hymn with a Nivid to the All-gods. Thesecond, the Agnimaruta,is composed of a hymn with a Nivid to Vai$vaiittra, a Dhayya, a hymn with a Nivid to the Maruts, the Stotriya and Anurupamade from Pragathas, a hymn with a Nivid to Jatavedas, and a mass of miscellaneous stanzas addressed to the waters, &c. The other fastrasare less important : the specimens givenindicate the confusion and elaboration of ideas. . 

In other cases there takes place an elaborate processof intermingling both verses and parts of verses of different strophes with one another. This is the rule with the recitation of the Valakhilya hymns, which may be treated in twodifferent but both complicated ways,1 with the Mahanamni verses,2 with the verse for the Apyayanaor swelling out of the dry Soma stems, and so forth. It is only worth notingthat as earlyas the Rigveda these puerilities seem to have been in vogue. 

The most importantdivision of the sacrifices is that between the Somaofferings and the offerings which are sometimes classed as Haviryajftas, andwhich differ essentially from the Soma sacrifice as they do not employthe Saman singers. With the latter may be classed the animal sacrifice, but it also forms an integral and important partof the Soma offering. 

2. The Establishment and Re-establishment of the Fires The ritual texts lay down various periodsas appropriatefor the setting upof the sacred fires,3 the springis the season for a Brahman, the summer for a Ksatriya, the rainy season for a Rathakara, and the autumn for a Vai?ya, or the cool season is suited for all castes. They also suggest that the proper time is the new moon, especially in conjunction with certain asterisms, but the full moon is also permissible. The essential partof the rite which takes twodays is the setting up of the fires : on the first day are set up two sheds, the one for the Garhapatya,the other for the Ahavanlya fire : the actual altar of the first is round, that of the second square: the Daksina fire is south of the Garhapatya and is shapedlike a half moon. The fire is obtained for the Garhapatya either by friction, or by being borrowed from the house of a wealthy man or distinguishedsacrificer. The nightof the first day is spent bythe sacrificer and his wife in wakefulness to the noise of lutes and flutes. Early in the morning the new fire for the hearths is produced by friction, and a horse is brought to watch and further the process by its presence, doubtless as a symbol of the fire or the sun. Moreover, while the fire is being produced byfriction from the wood,4 Samans may be sung. As soon as the fire appearsthe sacrificer breathes upon it and inhales it. It is placed on the Garhapatya and1 Cf. Oldenberg, Prolegomena, pp. 212 ff.,*ApfS. v. 1 ff.; BfS. ii; MS.i. 5 ; 6. 5; 494 ff., 514 ft. ; GGA. 1907, pp. 230 ff. ; KS. iv. 7-10 ; AS. ii. 1. 9 ff. ; ?S.

wood placed upon the fire : it is addressed with words which recall the ancestors of the offerer : thus an Angirasa refers to Angiras, a BhargavatotheBhrgus, a Rajanya to Indra, a Ksatriya to Varuna, a Vai9ya to ManuGramam, the typical village headman, and a Rathakrt to the Rbhus, the famous chariot makers among the gods. At the same time Samans may besung, not by the Saman singers, but, as in the Vajapeya and the Sautramani rites, by the Brahman or alternatively by the Adhvaryu himself. Thena brand is taken from the Garhapatya and borne to the Ahavanlya, the horse preceding it, and the sacrificer followingit so that the smoke reaches him : it is carried at first knee high, then navel high, and then the height of the face. The Daksijia fire is then in one version lightedin the same way ; according to others it precedes the setting up of the Ahavamya : it may also be madefrom the fire which on the preceding day was placed on the Garhapatyafor cooking the porridgefor the priest: at any rate it afterwards can be used for cooking any offerings save meat offerings. 

After the Ahavamya is set up follows, in the case of a Ksatriya only it seems, the setting up of a Sabhya fire, one doubtless in the Sabha, the meeting hall of the community. The ceremony for that is accompanied by the dicing for a cow as a prize by the priests perhapsor by Ksatriyas : the game is as usual unintelligible: it seems to have amounted to a test of the power to produce even numbers.1 In the normal case this ceremony is not performed, and the establishment of the fires ends with a full offering of butter to Agni, after which the Agnihotra can be duly performedwith the fires. Twelve days afterwards, the fires being carefully maintained in the interval, may be per formed the Tanuhavis offerings which are offerings to Agniin three forms, Pavamana, Pavaka, and uci. As soon as the performanceof the estab lishment is over, the sacrificer is bound to observe chastityfor 3 to 12 days, maintain the fire, offer the Agnihotra, and sleep on the ground near the fire. After that he must for all his days avoid untruth, place no bad wood on the fire, eat nothing cooked by a covered fire, drink no water from a ship, and so on. If he is prosperous he must keep up the fires all his life. 

The ceremony of re-establishment2is prescribedin cases where the fires bring the sacrificer no luck. The old fires are allowed to go out, and, after a break of three days to a year, new fires are established in much the same wayas before, but the fire is nourished when produced with Ku9a grass, not with wood. In the fore- and after-offerings which are partof the rite the use of different forms, Vibhakti, of the word Agni is expressly enjoined, doubtless to secure the special attention of the god to the new fires. The fees for the priest contain references to the character of the rite ; so for instance a mendedgarment and repairedchariot are given. Traces of a periodic re-establishment of outworn fires cannot be proved: the mere fact that the re-establishment,

if necessary, is placedat the period of the rains as well as at other times is inadequate evidence on which to found any theory.1 

3. The Fire-God Oblation or Agnihotra 

It is the duty of the man who has established his fires, as of the manwho has no fires, to offer daily, morning and evening, the Agnihotra :2 the precise time of offering, whether just before or justafter the rising of the sun in the morning, and whether after sunset or after the appearance of the first star in the evening, is a subject of much discussion in the Brahmarias and Sutras. If the fires were kept perpetually alight, then they required only to be brightened up for each occasion : if not, then the fire must be taken from the Garhapatya, either only every evening,it being used also for the morning, or each time : the Daksina might be kept perpetually alight, or taken out daily, or only onthe new- and full-moon days, on which accordingto some authorities the sacrificer must himself perform the ritual. The main offering was milk, milked by an Aryan into a pail made by an Aryan : the milk was heated andmixed with water on the Garhapatya, and offered in the Ahavaniya andGarhapatya. At the end the sacrificer eats and offers four water libations to the gods, the Fathers, the seven seers, and Agni on the earth, or to other deities also. The Daksina fire received no special honour. 

With the Agnihotra might be performed the ceremony of homage to the fires, Agnyupasthana, usually carried out at the night service only. TheAhavaniya is honoured first, then the cow from which the milk was taken, then the Garhapatya, and then the cow, or its calf might be substituted for the cow. At the end the sacrificer names the name of his dear son who is to succeed himin the duty. The same close connexion of the offering and the home is seen in the fact that, on going on a journey, the householder takes leave of the fires, and on return approaches them with wood and words of welcome. If he goes away from the old house for good, he offers a libation to Vastospati, the lord of the abode, while his cart has one horse, the right-hand one, spanned, andthe other not yoked. The obligation to offer the Agnihotraends only whenone becomes a wandering mendicant. 

There can be little doubt that even as early as the Rigveda there waspresent the idea that the Agnihotra, with its brightening up of the fires, was a spell to aid the rising of the sun, a view which was doubtless the ground of the opinionof those who pressedfor the performanceofthe ceremony before sunrise.3

The view of Feist (Kultur der Indoger manen, p. 345) that the fire worship takes its origin in respect to the spirits of the dead who congregate at the hearth is untenable; cf. Wissowa,

But we must not decide from this that the origin of the rite was a meresp^U : it is clearly the tendance of the god in the house, the family fire in adeveloped form in the rauta, in a simple form in the domestic ritual. 

4. The New-moon and Full-moon Sacrifices 

These sacrificesl are of special value as they form the model for all sacri fices of the type called Isti, which include an enormous number of offerings for special ends ; in all these cases the sacrifice is assumed to be performed pre cisely a.s in the new- and full -moon offerings, but with the distinction that somespecial rite is inserted in the placeof the essential features of these offerings, which are at the full -moon offering a cake for Agni and Soma, and at the new moon offering a cake for Agni and Indra. Moreover, at the latter offering someauthorities allowed a milk mess made of sweet and sour milk for Indra or Mahendra, while others restricted this offering to one who offered the Somasacrifice. The new and full moon themselves received no offerings, except in the view of certain authorities who prescribed offerings to the Parvans : the times served only to fix the dates of the offerings, and there was, it is clear, difficulty in deciding exactly when the offerings should be made. Two days were required at new moon, but one might suffice at the full moon. On the first day the ceremonies were in the main preparatory, the making ready of the fires, and the taking of a vow by the sacrificer, which involved abstinence from meat, sleeping on the ground, the cuttingof hair and beard, and so on. If the milk mess were to be offered on this day, a twigof Pala^a or amiwood was cut to drive away the calves from the cows, for the milking of the latter, a rite which is paralleledin western Europe.2 The ceremonies of the second day consisted in the preparationof the rice, its pounding and husking, the cooking of the cakes, the preparationof the altar, the girding of the wife of the sacrificer, the looking at a pot of butter, the covering of the altar with the grass, and the setting up of the partitioningsticks which were intended to keep off evil spirits. At the end of these preliminaries the real sacrifice begins ; first come fifteen Samidhem verses accompanying the laying on of kindling wood. The verses are joined into a single whole by the device of pausing after the first half verse of each. Then come two libations of the butter, doubtless in part at least necessary to make the fire burn brightly ; between themcomes the Pravara, the enumeration of the seers who were claimed as ancestors by the sacrificer or if he were not a Brahman by his Purohita andthe invitation of the gods, whom Agni is invoked to bring to the offering in the order in which they were to be honoured. After the second of these Agharascomes the formal choosing of the Hotr by the Adhvaryu on the authority of

the Agnidhra, in which the ancestors of the sacrificer are again named. TheHotr then touches the Adhvaryu and Agnidhra, in order doubtless to establish a community between them. Then come the fore-offerings of butter to the kindling sticks, the god Tanunapat or Nara^ansa, the sacrificial food (idd), the gods who have been invited to the offering and are now honoured. Thencome the Ajya offerings of butter for Agni and Soma, which at the new moonmust be accompanied by verses containing the word vrdh,'grow ', and at the full moon by verses referring to the slayingof Vrtra. There follows a cake for Agni, a butter offering made in a low tone for Agni and Soma, and then the offering, to Agni and Soma at the full moon, to Agni and Indra, with or with out a milk mess for Indra, at the new moon. The close of the offeringis marked by an offering to Agni Svistakrt,4 the maker of the sacrifice correct ', in which all the gods are invoked. Then comes the tasting of the offering bythe priest, the Brahman has a special portion, the Pra9itra, the Agnidhra another, the Sa4avatta, and all the priests invoke the Icja, which is taken fromall the offerings, and, while doing so, they touch the sacrificer. Then the cakes are given to them, and thereafter each has a part of the I<Ja. The Fathers are invoked to take part, and the fees are given,in this case the Anvaharya mess cooked in the Daksina fire, perhaps merely because of the name. The dis tribution of the fees is followed by the Anuyajas, to the strew, Naragaftsa, andAgni Svistakrt, and the Suktavaka, which concludes with an invocation of prosperity for the sacrificer and a prayer ; at the end of this prayer the Prastara, or bundle of grass which is supposedto represent the sacrificer, is put in the fire. Then comes the amyuvaka, an invocation of prosperity, accompanied by the burning of the enclosing sticks. The remains are offered to the All-gods, then follow four Patmsamyajas, offerings to the gods with the wives of the gods, to Soma, Tvastr, the wives of the gods, and AgniGrhapati : the third is offered under a covering while the wife of the sacrificer touches the Adhvaryu : the offerings are of butter, and made in the Garhapatyafire. Then come minor rites to accompany the burningof the strew, and to make good defects, the Raksases are given the fragments which have been produced in the husking of the rice, the wife's girdleis loosened and laid down, the sacrificer in imitation of and assimilation to Visnu strides three steps from the south hip of the altar ground, which is made to be like the shape of a woman, to the east, pays reverence to the Ahavanlya and Garhapatya, andthen lays aside his vow. 

The rite is to be performedall one's life, or for thirty years, or for fifteen only, in which case the two offerings are to be conjoined : in the Dakayanaform *it is celebrated every day for a year only, both forms being used.

bhanlya Isti is offered, which consists of a cake on eleven potsherds a paf> for Sarasvatl, and a cake on twelve potsherds for Sarasvant. It is offered as an independent rite on the first full-moon day after the Agny&dhana andAgnihotra. Each new- and full-moon sacrifice can be followed by an offering to Aditi and to Indra Vaimrdha, and the sacrifice can be carried out withSoma if desired and so also the other Haviryajfias.1 

The position of Agni and Soma in the ritual is peculiarin view of the rarity of the conjunction of these gods in the Rigveda, and it is a legitimate andprobable conjecture of Oldenberg's2 that the place they obtained was only gradually won by them, in consequence in some degree at least of the tendencyto see the moon in Soma. 

5. The Four-month or Seasonal Sacrifices 

The three four-month offerings8 are connected intimately with the seasons of the year, the Vaigvadeva being offered in spring, the Varuijapra ghasas in the rains, and the Sakamedhas in the autumn, at the beginning of each season. The connexion with the seasons is shown by the formulae, the names of the months which are connected with certain libations, and the formal cutting of the hair which is connected with certain of the rites. Theman who first performs them must begin with an Isti to Agni Vaigvanara andParjanya or an Anvarambhaniya Isti. In each case the sacrifice is introduced by five libations to Agni, Soma, Savitr, Sarasvatl, and Pusan. In the first follow offerings to the Maruts, to the All-gods, and to heaven and earth, the first and last of cakes, the second of a milk mess. The season is indicated bythe use of a tree with budding branches for the wood for the fire, while the strew is made from plants which are shooting. 

The second offering, the Varunapraghasas, is more important. One point in it is the preparation of two animals, a ram and sheep, from barley, which the sacrificer and his wife cover with wool and equip with the marks of sex made prominent ; the Adharyu makes the one, the Pratiprasthatr the other : there arc two Vedis, and the south one is assignedto the latter priest, who there performs a mimicry of the action of the Adhvaryu. There are offerings to Indra and Agni, to Varuna, to the Maruts and to Ka : the ram and the ewe are offered in the milk messes presented to Varujia and the Maruts respec tively, the remainder being eaten. A further important pointis the ceremonyalready referred to,4 by which the wife of the sacrificer is called upon to admitwhat lovers she has and to offer in the Daksina fire the plates of Karambha,vporridge:,which number one more than the members of the family. The

husband and wife then share a bath, washing each other in it. The tWoelements of the rite are clearly enough the aim to secure the abundance of the flocks, and the sin offering to Varuna, whose presencein the rite may be due either to his deep and undeniable connexion with water, or merely be ac counted for by the sin offering and the concluding bath, which are clearlyin great measure merely pieces of magic to which a religious connexion has been attached. 

The third festival is the Sakamedhas : the number of offerings in it, especially for the Maruts, is considerable, but the most importantelement is a feast for the dead, the Pitryajfta, or Mahapitryajfta, where the Fathers are honoured as Somavantas,fc connected with Soma ', sitting on the strew, and as*burnt by Agni '. The rite follows the rules for offerings to the dead : it takes place in a hut south of the Daksina fire, in which a Vedi is made andthe fire there placed: the offerings are made with the term Svadha* in place of SvahS. Still more important is an offering to Tryambaka,2 which is an offering to Rudra, everything therefore being done in the north, the regionof that god. At a cross-way a fire is made and cakes offered in it, at least four, but properly one more than the number of the members of the family. One, however, is thrown upon an ant-heap in the north with the words,fc This is thy portion : the mole is thine animal, O Rudra \ On returning the priests engaged and the sacrificer all say,' We supplicate Rudra away from us, awaythe god Tryambaka '. As in the offering to the Fathers, they go round the fire thrice from right to left, smiting the left thigh, then thrice in the opposite and normal way, smiting the right thigh, and the same form is followed by the unmarried women of the family,in verses which show that they hoped thus to secure marriage and avoid death. The remains of the cakes the sacrificer throws up in the air and catches as theyfall : the cakes are then tied up in two baskets, tied to a bamboo, and placed on a tree3 or some similar object so high that an ox cannot reach them. Rudra is then asked to go away beyondthe Mujavants, after which the breath is held and the sacrificers return from the place without looking back,* and touch water. The fee is a white horse, 1 This term is of ambiguous sense, but chthonic powers Weber (Rdjasuya,p.U, 

refers perhaps to the self-disposal or n. 4) ingeniously but most implausibly volition of the dread spirits. This conjectures to be due to a desire to according to Oldenberg (ReL des Veda*, show the complete confidence of safety p. 531, n. 3) is due to their partaking of produced in the mind of the performer the food for the dead. Contra, Colinet, by his devotion. The placing of gifts 

Melanges Ltvi, pp. 150 ff. on a tree is a rite with many parallels ; 8 Arbman, Rudra, pp. 48-04 ; Hillebrandt, Meyer (Gesch. d. Alt.3 1.ii. p. 722) holds Ved.Myth.ii. 186 ff. that the idea is to bring the offer* 3 So ateo in the Baudhyavihfira rite in ing (e.g. in Ilion and Bambyke live HfS. ii. 9. 1. Rudra thus stands out animals) into immediate contact with in ritual as associated with a primitive the divinity temporarily resident in the mode of offering. Of. above, Chap. 9, tree.

Chap, aoj The Four-month or Seasonal Sacrifices 323  

ora bull, white or with white marks. The festival is followed by an offering to itn&sirau, which is evidently an agriculturalrite for ploughing, addressed to two pprts or deities of the plough. The features of it are a cake on twelve 

potsherds for funaslrau or Indra unasiriya, fresh milk or barley gruel for Vayu, and a cake on one potsherd for Surya : the fee is a six or twelve spanplough or two plough beasts, while for the offering to Sflrya a white horse or sheep is the fee. A curious way of celebrating the whole of the offering together, in five days from the llth day of the light half of Phalguna to the full mooR, is recorded as practised by the Kashas. The offerings can also be connected with the Soma and the animal offering in such a way that the six days of the three make up a Prsthya Sadaha. 

6. First-fruit Sacrifice (Agrayana Isti) and others Before partaking of any of the fruits of the fields it is necessary for a manwho has established the fires to make offerings.1 The normal offerings are those of rice in autumn, and barley in spring: alternatives are bamboo seeds in summer, and millet in autumn or the rains : in these two cases Soma is the god to whom the offerings are made : in the other case Indra and Agnireceive a cake of the new fruits, and the All-gods and heaven and earth also have offerings. In the first case the fee is a garment or a repaired car, in the second the firstborn of the calves cast that year. In place, however, of the ordinary Isti the new- and full-moon sacrifices may be performed,or the Agni hotra made night and morning with the new fruits. Or, again, the rice or barley may be given to a cow to eat, and then the Agnihotra offered with the milk of that cow. In that case the motive of the offering may be taken as merely a desire to secure that the first-fruits shall, in the first place, be used by some one other than man ; but it is more probable that we have nothing more here than the not rare practice of giving animals food in placeof the deities, or yet more probably that the offering is merely a variety of the normaloffering, milk being used instead of the actual first-fruits, a simple explanation, and one perfectly reasonable in itself. The offering of first-fruits then remains a perfectly natural offering to the gods, rather however as the formulae showan offering to secure the safe use of the fruits, than the expressionof gratitude to the gods for their gift. That it was felt to be in any way sacramental, or even as inducing a special sense of community, is not to be seen in the Vedic evidence. 

Of other Istis there are innumerable varieties, but they are all based on the model of the new- and full-moon offerings, and differ only in the presenceof mere conjecture. Helm (Altgerm. Rel. Fcstgruss an Bdhtlingk, pp. 79 ff. In i. 244 f.) ascribes the German rite (Tac. Mexico the eating of maize had to be 

Ann. i. 67) either to an offering to wind preceded by a human sacrifice; and air demons or to tree spirits. Sahagun, trans, by Jourdanet and . vi. 20. 2 ff. ; BS. iii. 12 ; MS. i.

certain new offerings. Thus, there are Istis for one who desires a son, for various purifications, for making people subject to the sacrificer, and So on. One of the most interesting is the Karlriti, which is obviously a dressed uprain spell. A black horse is placed in the east facing west ; the sacrificer robes it with a black garment and makes it neigh, and from the sounds which it makes and its actions he can foretell rain.1 The new- and full-moon offerings themselves can be appliedto fulfil wishes, and forms of these offerings are mentioned such as the Munyayana, TurSyana, and Vasisthayajfta, which may extend to a year in duration. 

7. The Animal Sacrifice 

According to the Sutras we must distinguish between the animal sacrifice as an independent offering and the sacrifice as connected with the Somasacrifice : the offering of a goat to Agni and Soma in that offeringis often treated as the Prakrti of all animal sacrifices, but in some cases the indepen dent animal offering which is called the Nirudhapafubandha2 takes the place of the Agnisomiya. The rite is to be performed by any man who establishes the fires, before he eats meat, and then yearlyor half yearly, in which case the beginning of the bright course of the sun and the end of that periodare pre scribed by some authorities. The form of the offeringis that of the new-moonsacrifice, the victim takingthe place of the milk offered to Indra or Mahendra, but there is present another priest, the Maitravaruna, whose duty it is to give directions to the Hotr to say his Yajya verses. For Indra and Agni,or Surya, or Prajapati, a goat is the victim ; it must be perfect, free from blemish, such as the loss of a horn or an eye ; but in other offerings than the Niriicjha pa^ubandha are found many other animals, including normally oxen andsheep ; and exceptionally, as at the piling of the fire, at the horse sacrifice andat human sacrifices, large numbers of victims are alleged to be offered, mainly if not entirely in theory. For Nirrti the dove, owl, and hare are offered,8 to the Raksases the black dog, the ass with lop ears, and the unknown tarakpu.* Some animals appear as unfit for ordinary sacrifice, the dog, the durvar&ha, 4 bad boar ', and edaka,'vicious ram '. The normal rite occupies two days, of which the former is filled by preliminary rites, the second being the day of the actual sacrifice. The two days however may be compressed into one. An essential feature of the rite is the use of a post, to which the victim is

tied : in the greaterrites as many as eleven are used : the tree is solemnly cut down*with protestations that it is not being injured, and, when a splinteris struck out of it in the cutting, that is kept and placed ultimately in the pit in which the post is inserted. The stump is treated with respect, and receives a libation, accompanied by a prayer that it shall spring up with a hundredshoots. The post is placedin a hole which is half within, half without the altar. Round the post a band is placed at the height of the navel ; if the sacrificer wishes little or much rain he places it lower or higher. For the sacrifice the altar is placed west of the fire, and in the east third of it another altar, Uttaravedi, is provided as at the Varuriapraghasas, and a fire placed there, which takes the placeof the normal Ahavamya, while that serves as the Garhapatya. There are requiredalso special implements, the spit for the heart, and the utensils by which the omentum is cooked. When the prepara tions are over, the victim is bathed, and brought up, and tied to the post bya string, which is fastened to the left forefoot, round the back, and over the left horn : it is then sprinkled and given a drink.1 Then the kindling verses are said, the butter oblations are offered, the victim is anointed with the butter,2 and the usual procedure of the new- and full-moon sacrifices followed down to the fore-offerings, which number eleven and to which the Apr! litanies provide the Yajya verses. After the tenth of the fore-offerings, the splinter of the tree, and the one edge of the two-edged knife, are dippedin the butter : the actual slaying must be done with the unconsecrated side bythe slaughterer or famitr, the other being used by the Adhvaryu to cut off portions for offering. The Agmdhra thrice carries a brand round the victim, the Apavya libations are performed,the Adhvaryu gives through the Maitra varuria the order to the Hotr to recite the old litany8 for the slaying of the victim ; from the Garhapatya fire flame is placed on the amitra fire, the victim is then taken over to that fire, preceded by the Agmdhra with his fire brand, followed by the Pratiprasthatr, touching it with the spit, the Adhvaryuholding on to him and the sacrificer to the Adhvaryu, thus keepingin close contact with the holy power in the victim. Then the victim, with its head facing west, its feet north, is by the amitrs strangledor pierced without sound,4 while the rest of those present turn their heads away. Then a libation is made, and the wife of the sacrificer brought up. The Adhvaryu or the wife pours water over the members of the victim and washes them. The omentum

is taken out and placed on a spit: in the first blood a grass blade is dipped, and thrown north-west or south-west as a spell to devote the enemy to the deepest darkness. It is cooked on the amitra fire, and then placed on the Uttaravedi, where it is covered with butter. Then come the eleventh fore 

offering, the two butter portions, and then the offering of the whole of the omentum, which is covered with pieces of gold and butter. The spits are then cast into the fire, and the fees distributed, three barren or three milch cows. Then come the making of the rice cake and the cutting up of the victim : of 

these eighteen portionsare made, of which the first eight count as daivatdni : the heart is cooked separately on a spit, the rest of the pieces are cooked in a pot, while the excrement, blood, and stomach are offered to the Raksases, in a pit west of the f&mitra fire outside the altar-ground. The various parts of the animal are then offered, the priests hare shares both of the I<Ja as usual and of the meat. Then come the 11 after-offerings, offerings to the strew, the divine doors, &c. With each of the after-offerings a supplementary offeringis connected in which the Pratiprasthatroffers pieces of the intestines which are left over. The splinter, the staff, of which the Maitravaruna never lets go, and the Prastara,* bundle of grass ', are put into the fire. The offering to the wives of the gods is performed with the tail of the victim, the heart spit is buried, with a verse imploring Varurja to forgive sin, in the presenceof the sacrificer, his wife, and all the priests.1 As they go back they each pick upthree dry twigs, and place them on the Uttaravedi. 

The animal sacrifice can be used for many special purposes,in which cases some variation is made to adapt it to the special end in view. In all its essential features the offering must be regardedas a gift only : the presence of the divine essence in the victim is clearly proved by abundantevidence, and the priestsall taste of it. But there is not the slightest sign in the elaborate ritual, nor in the formulae which are recorded in full, that there was any idea that the death of the victim was the ritual death of one of the gods, or that the ceremony was a sacrament, in which worshippers renewedor strengthened their union with the god by a common meal.2 

8. The Soma Sacrifice 

The model form of the Soma sacrifice may be said to be the Agnitoma,8 which is the simplest form of the one-day Soma sacrifice, that is an offering onwhich the Soma is offered on one day only,in the morning, at midday, and

1 Above, Part III, Chap. 18, 6. a divinity.

in. the evening. The name Agnitoma appears to be due to the fact that the last pf the Samans used on the day is addressed to Agni. Its time of per* formance is left vague by the texts : the evidence that it was a spring festival, celebrated at the new- or full-moon, which marked the beginning of the year, 

at which the nectar of the gods was offered to them in the shape of King Soma,as is held by Hillebrandt, is clearly inadequate even to make probable this thesis. 

In the Soma sacrifice the animal sacrifice plays an important part. In the first place, on the last of the Upasad days, which precede the day of pressing, there is an offering of a goat for Agni and Soma : secondly, there is a victim which is offered throughout the day of pressing, and which is sacrificed to Agni in the Agnistoma, but in the Ukthya form of the Soma sacrifice to Indra and Agni, in the So<Jain to Indra, and in the Atiratra to Sarasvati : the moreprevalent view, however, adds the extra victim to each different form, so that the Atiratra form has all four. Thirdly, after the final bath and before the concluding Isti there is a barren cow for Mitra and Varuna, or three for Mitra and Varuna, the All-gods, and Brhaspati. 

The offering is preceded by the choice of the priests, who are invited to come by a herald announcing the offering, and the obtainingof a placeof sacrifice which the sacrificer asks from the prince, and which the latter mustgive on pain of the grave displeasureof the priest. Before or after this act, the consecration of the sacrificer takes placein the manner abovel described. The length of the consecration may last anything from one, three, or four days up to a year : he sends out peopleto obtain food for him in this time, and his name is absolutely taboo. Then comes the purchase of the Soma, in whichtakes place a pretended buying by a cow, but it is taken away from the seller : there is a clear mimicry in some measure of the winning of the divine drink from the hands of the Gandharvas. The Soma is then brought forward on a cart, and the Subrahmanya utters the formula, whence he derives his name,and which invites Indra to the drinking of the Soma. The guest-offeringis then given to the Soma, and the priests and the sacrificer, by touching together butter taken from the guest-offering, conclude a close alliance not to prove false to one another in the rite. The Agnidhra brings the Madantlwaters which all touch, and the sacrificer undertakes the Av&ntarad!kft, *intermediate consecration ', in which he draws tighterhis girdle, clasps morefirmly his fist, and only drinks warm milk. Then comes the Pravargya rite, which will be described below, and three days of Upasads, in which offerings are made before and after midday with reference to the iron, silver, and golden forms of Agni. The term refers to sieges, but it is impossibleto accept the suggestion of Hillebrandt2 that the rites of besiegingcities have been here interpolated : the siegeis a mythical one. The second Upasad day is the time 

1 Part III, Chap. 19, 1. im often Indien, p. 85) suggests that 1RituallitteTotur, p. 127 ; Fed. Myth. i. 300. Upasad means fasting. Hauer (Die Anfdnge der Yogapraxis

328 Vedic Ritual   

for the construction of the Mahavedi,'greataltar'. The carts, which have the Soma, are placed in it, and three paces east from its west end is the Satfas, 'seat ', which is a hut covered over, in which ceremony the Udgatr helps the Adhvaryu as in other parts of the service. In front of the axle of thfe right hand cart four sounding holes are made, which are used as an earth drum to increase the sound of the pressing of the Soma with the stones. Over the holes, which at the foot are not separated, are placed the pressing-boards, and over them again the skin on which the stones are placed. The earth thrown upfrom the pit serves to make six fire hearths or Dhisnyas, which extend fromsouth to north, and are appropriatedto the Maitravaruna, Hotr, Brahmapac chaftsin, Potr, Nestr and Achavaka. Outside the Sadas, on the rightside of the Vedi, is the Marjallya hearth, used for cleansing the utensils, and opposite it the hut for the Agnidhriya fire. 

The offering of the victim to Agni and Soma is the occasion of an interest ing rite : the sons, grandsons, and relatives of the sacrificer are invited to assist in it : the Adhvaryu takes hold of the sacrificer, the wife of the Adhvaryu, of her the sons, of them the grandchildren, and of them the relatives, thus presenting a pictureof family ritual, which is the more note worthy in that it is not connected as usual with the worship of the dead. Thewhole body set themselves in processionto the Agnidhriya and the Ahavaniyato the recitation of verses for the bringing forward of Agni and Soma. Before the offering is actually made, the Avantaradiksa comes to an end. Thesacrificer unloosens his girdle,lets go his fist, and gives up the restrictions hitherto imposed on him. The victim is then offered, and the waters for use are drawn in some place shadowed from the sun, while the cows are milked, and the sacrificer spends the night awake and guarding the Soma. 

The early dawn of the next day sees the service commenced by the per formance of the Prataranuvaka,cmorning litany ', addressed to Agni, the Dawn, and the Ayvins : the rule according to some texts is that the recitation is to be kept up from very early in the morning to the break of day. At the same time cakes are made ready for offerings to Indra Harivant, Indra andPusan, Sarasvati, Bharati, Indra, and Mitra and Varuna. Then comes the ceremony of fetching waters for use in the mixing of the Soma. 

The pressing of the Soma may be preceded by the offering of cups of curds, butter, or Soma, in which case a few stalks only are pressed: in the Vajapeyaand the Rajasuya there are also the An9u and Adabhya cups, the first of sour milk merely touched with Soma stalks, the latter of Soma. The great pressing is preceded by the UpaAgusavana which provides Soma for the UpaJtt?u cup. The pressing takes placein three rounds : the Adhvaryu,Pratiprasthatr, and Unnetr are the performers : the juiceis poured into the Adhavamya vessel, which is filled with water, and is then passed through a sieve to the wooden tub. The Unnetr draws Soma from the Adhavamyawith a vessel, and pours it into the Hotr's cup, and the sacrificer then pours from it an unbroken stream on the sieve from which the next cups are drawn

for offering, the Antaryama, Aindravayava, Maitravaruna, fukra, Manthin, Agrpyana, Ukthya, and Dhruva, which, therefore, are called Dh&r&grahas, as opposed to the other cups, which are made full from the wooden tub with the vessel called Pariplava. The rest of the Soma is placedin the Putabhrt

vessel, except a part needed to fill the goblets, Camasas, of the priests. After libations to atone for loss of drops of Soma, the Bahispavamana Stotra is performed by the priests to accompany the purifyingof the Soma : it is repeated outside the Sadas. The priests creepto the performance of this Stotra, each holding the previous one,1 and the Adhvaryu starts the perform ance by handing to the Prastotr a handful of Darbha grass, which the latter hands to the Udgatr, asking the Brahman's authority to begin. The song is duly sung, the A9vina cup is offered, and the victims sacrificed, and a cake offering is made in accordance with the preparationof the early morning. Thecups for the double deities, Indra and Vayu, Mitra and Varuna, and the Avins, are then offered ; then are filled the goblets of the priests, and offerings of the ukra and Manthin cups made for the strange figures of an<Ja andMarka. The oblations are made from the cups of the priests by the Adhvaryu,and the priests partake of the remainder. The emptied cups are now filled again and placed under the back part of the southern Soma cart, receiving the name Naragaftsa and being allotted to the Fathers as Avamas, Urvas, andKavyas. The Achavaka hereupon makes his appearance, and, if the Hotrconsents to allow this late innovation among the priests to have a share in the rite, he is given a portion of the cake ; then follow 12 or 14 season offerings andthen the Hotr recites his Ajya astra, the contents of which have already beengiven.2 The end of the astra is marked by the offering and partaking of the cup of Soma and the Nara^ansa cups are also partaken of, but not offered. From them is taken a cup for the All-gods, and then follows the second Stotra, followed by the Praiiga astra of the Hotr ; the cup is offered andpartaken of with the NaraaAsas as before. Then a third of the Ukthya is taken for each of Mitra and Varuna, Indra, and Indra and Agni respectively, and used as the libations for the Stotras and astras, three in number, whichend the pressing : the astras are recited by the Maitravaruna, Brahmanac chahsin, and Achavaka. 

The midday pressing follows mainly the form of that of the morning : the season cups and those for two deities are omitted, and a new priest appearsin the shape of the Gravastut,*praiser of the stones ', whose business it is to say the verses addressed to the pressing stones, and who duringhis work keeps his head covered in a cloth lent to him by the sacrificer.8 The ukra and Manthin, the Agrayana, the two Marutvatlyas, and the Ukthya before or between themform the cups for the midday pressing. The Bahispavamana is represented by

the Madhyandinapavam,na Stotra. At the end of it there is the place of the preparation of the drink of hot sour milk, the Dadhigharma, which is provedto have existed even in the time of the Rigveda. Then come the oake offering, the filling of the goblets, the offering of the fukra and Manthin cups, a*nd the furthef ceremonies down to the depositing of the Nara^arisa cups,after whichthe fees should be given, consisting of 7, 21, 60 to 1,000 cattle, or all the sacrificer's goods save his eldest son. In case of these two highest numbers he must also give a mule, for some uncertain cause. The sacriftcer divides his largesse, cattle, sheep, horses, elephants, servants, clothes, in four hea.ps, the Adhvaryu has one share, out of which portions are obtained by the Prati prasth&tr, the Nestr and Unnetr, of a half, a third, and fourth respectively of the Adhvaryu's share, and so with the other priests. An Atreya is given a gold gift in addition : Kanvas, Kayapas, and ignorant Brahmans get nothing : even a daughter may be given in the form of marriage known as 

daiva,4 divine V After the fees are received two Marutvatiya cupsare offered, and then a third which is the occasion of the Marutvatiya astra of the Hotr. Then a libation is made to Mahendra, which is accompanied bythe first Prstha Stotra of the Saman singers, and the Niskevalya fastra Of the Hotr. Three Atigrahyas are offered at the same time, for Agni, Indra, andSurya. Then follows as in the morning three Ukthya cups with the second to fourth Prstha Stotras and the three astras of the Maitravaruna, Brah manacchai'isin, and Achavaka. 

The evening pressing is intended by an Aditya cup, which is the means of producing magic effects according as it is prepared. It is made out of the remains of the cups for two deities, and is made ready, when both doors of the hut of the Soma carts are closed. The main pressingis much as in the morning, but the old Soma shoots are used as well as new. The Agrayana is 

performed with four streams, not three as at midday, or two as at the morning. The Arbhavapavamana Stotra is followed by the proceeding with the un finished animal offering, then the cake offering takes place, and the rest goes on as at midday until the Nara^aftsa cups are disposed of. There follows a libation in which the Fathers are referred to. After that the Savitra cup is offered, and thereafter the Vaivadeva cup which gives rise to the Vaifvadeva

astra. Now a pap is offered : and the Udgatrs look at themselves in butter. Then a Pfitnlvata cup is offered, in connexion with which the Agnidh sits on the lap of the Nes^r, who fetches thereafterthe wife ofthe sacrificer. The Adhvaryustarts the Yajftayajftlya Saman, the sacrificer repeats the formula called Saptahotr, the Netr causes the wife to be looked at by the Udgatr, and she pours along her thigh water. Then follows the AgnimSruta astra. With this the rite is drawing to a close : the main sacrifice is completed, the Hariyo jana cup is offered, and finally there is the Avabhrtha in which many of the utensils are thrown into the water ; the sacrificer and his wife have a bath, andput on new clothes. There still, however, have to be performed an Udayaniy ' On Vedic marriage cf. Macdonell and Keith, Vedic Index, ii. 479 ff.Chap. 20] The Soma Sacrifice 331  

offering, the sacrifice of a barren cow to Mitra and Varuna, for which the Bahvrcas substitute a mere milk offering, an offering to the minor deities, or in the case of a king to the divine impellers, and the burning of the strew and other minor rites, and at last an Udavasamya offering. 

There can be no doubt whatever as to the'great part played by Indra in the Soma offering : the midday pressingis almost entirely his, the Marutsappearing only in his company, though at the evening pressinghis placeis comparatively slight. In the morning we find in the Praiiga astra, which is certainly to be traced to the Rigveda, invocations of seven sets of gods,first Vayu, then Indra and Vayu, Mitra and Varuna, the Avins, Indra, the All gods, and Sarasvatl, while the three litanies of the assistants of the Hotr are devoted to Mitra and Varuna, Indra, and Indra and Agni. In the evening the ritual finds placesfor the Adityas, Savitr, the All-gods, Agni with the wives of the gods, and Indra with the bay steeds. The Rbhus thus play a very minor part, though they have verses and though their old importance, whichis asserted in the Rigveda, may be traced in the name of the Arbhavapavamfiiia Stotra. In the case of the Adityas we have evidence in the Rigveda of their having a share in the offering, and so also in the case of Agni and the Maruts, but so comparatively seldom as to show that the position of these gods wasdistinctly far from assured as regards their share in the Soma sacrifice. Thewives of the gods are also mentioned in the Rigveda as having a part, but never Savitr, a fact which is doubtless fair evidence that the Rigveda did not know him as having a placein the rite, and that he was later brought in, per haps because of his growing importance, perhaps as an Aditya. The position of Agni also in the rite is a proof that he was not at first one of the great Somadrinkers : he appears in it in the main as connected with Indra, or as one of many other gods. On the other hand, the evidence of the Rigveda forbids the adoption of the view that the Soma offering was originally given to Indra alone : if that were the case it lies in times beyond our possibility of knowledge. The exclusion of Rudra, which seems, however, to be post-Rigvedic, though it is marked in the ritual, is the obvious result of his hostile nature.1 

In some places it is clear enough that the Soma sacrifice was considered as a rain spell :2 the pressingof the juice from the plant, and the pouringof the water and the juice through the sieve, are sufficient in themselves to import a rain spell of the normal Vedic type, and there can be no doubt that this view explains the fact that Soma is often regarded as a rain bringer, though doubt less in part that idea may be merely an extension of the practice of applying to any great god all the powers, which are important to man. But to go so far as to suggest, as Hillebrandt3 does, that the essence of the sacrifice was a piece of magic, the moon's rays being full of nectar and being represented bythe shoots of the Soma plant, so that the manipulationsof the priests are

adequate to supply the gods with the nectar drink which they love, is to misunderstand the nature of the sacrifice completely, and further the wholeidea is vitiated by the assumption which the author has never proved nor evenmade plausible that Soma in the Rigveda is the moon. Nor, as we hav seen, is there any real possibility of proving that the Soma offering has any totein istic flavour : it can be shown to be nothing but the offering to the godof the intoxicating drink, which in itself, on the other hand, creates the conceptionof the god Soma, who later and only among the Brahmans in the first instance is by the exercise of creative fancy equated with the moon.1 

An ingenious but implausible suggestion is that of von Schroeder,* who, accepting as primitive the connexion of Soma with the moon, holds that the purpose of the rite was to enable the sacrificer to assimilate in the form of a symbol of the moon the strength of the moon itself, just as in the Pravargyaceremony8 we may see the sacrificer acquiring the strength of the sun bydrinking the hot milk, which is as naturally offered to the sun as is Soma to the moon. There is, however, clearly no positive evidence to support these suggestions as representing primitive views of either offering. 

9. The Pravargya or Hot-milk Sacrifice 

In the Soma sacrifice the Pravargya4is inserted by the ritual text-books 

J, 

as an element which is to be performed twice a day in the course of the Upasaddays, giving, with the normal three Upasads, six performances. But there is great doubt as to whether the rite is necessary, or whether it should be per formed also at the first Agnistoma, or not until after one has been performed. The discrepancy of opinion suggests that the rite was originally a separate sacrifice altogether, and this is borne out by the Rigveda, where it seems to have been an offering made in the morning only. From clay chosen from a pit east of the Ahavanlya fire, to which a horse leads the way, a Mahavlra potis made, a span high, two spare pots, and various other utensils. A stool of Muflja grass is also made as a throne for the pot. The potis heated, the milk of a cow and a goat is poured in. Finally, the hot drink is offered to the Ajvins, and two Rauhina cakes are also offered in the morning to the day, in the evening to the night. At the outset of the ceremony the wife of the sacrificer is made to cover her head, but she joins with the rest at the close in the finale of the Saman which is sung. At the end the offeringutensils are arranged so as to make up the semblance of a man, the three Mahavlra

vessels marking the head, and so on. There are as usual prescriptionsfor the various accidents which may happen in the course of the rite, and, when it is performed, the sacrificer for a year eats no food, has intercourse with nowoman of a certain class, and drinks from no earthen vessel. Moreover, for a year before the offering the same taboos should be observed and the rite studied in advance. 

The rite is explained by the Aitareya Brahmana 1 as a mystic union of the gods which provides a new body for the sacrificer, and this theory is accepted by Geldner,2 who regards it as an allegory of sexual union generally. This is not an attractive explanation : the explanation of the Sfahavlra pot as a symbol of the Linga is wholly unsupported by a single word in the formulae, and the explanations of the Brahmanas are always to be taken with the utmost care. On the other hand, we have clear suggestions in other passages that the rite, which is one of a specially dangerous, that is, sacred type,8 

was understood as a sun spell, and this is directly indicated by the formulae used at the rite. The pot is covered with a golden plate, which can be nothing else than a symbol of fire or the sun, the pot glows, the milk, which in its whiteness is a sun symbol, boils with heat. The sacrificer by drinking as usual a share of the milk thus gains power at the same time as the sun is strengthened. Nor is there any objection to the fact that the offeringis madeto the A^vins : the turning of magic into prayer and sacrifice is a constant feature of the Vedic ritual, parallel to the turning of prayer and sacrifice into magic, and, once the rite existed, the idea of presenting the milk to the A9vins, the harbingers of morning, was almost inevitable.4 

Mystically the rite seems in the fatapatha Brahmana5 to have been inter preted in the sense that the pot was the sun, the milk the divine flood of life and light which falls to the sacrificer : as the sun is the head of the universe, so the pot is the head of the sacrificer : the rite provides the sacrificer and the universe alike with a head. Hence the deep reverence paidto the pot, andits optional character in the rite, since the Soma sacrifice by itself wouldconfer th6 same blessings. The Aitareya Brahmana holds that it must not beperformed until after a Soma sacrifice, a view which is explained by the Kausitaki Brahmana which requires that the body of the sacrificer should befirst completed by the Soma sacrifice, and so made able to receive a head. 

10. The Aikddafina Animal Offering 

This is a special form6 of the animal sacrifice which takes the place of the simpler ritual observed in the Agnistoma, when it is preferred to use eleven 1 i. 22. 14 ; KB. viii. -7. Hillebrandt, Ved. Myth. ii. 217 ff.

for the one victim there prescribed. In that case the ceremony is lengthened by the performancefor each of the victims of the formal rite of the slaying, &c. : the general parts, such as the fore-offerings, are not repeated for each. Thirteen posts are used in place of one : the twelfth, the Upacaya, is not set up, and the thirteenth is reserved under the name of Patmvata for an offering 

at the end of the ceremony. The middlemost postis placed near the fire, then one on either side, the rule being that the height increases from north to south : the Upagaya is bound round with two cords, and placed at the southern post with maledictions on an enemy. To the centre postis tied the victim for Agni, north to it the sheep for Sarasvatl, south the goat for Soma, and so on, ending with the victim for Varuna on the south : mentally a beast of the wild, luch as a mole, is attributed to the Upa9aya. After the offering of the omentum of the Anubandhya cow, preparationsare made for an offering of a victim to Tvastr at the Patmvata post, but the victim, which must be reddish brown, after the carrying round of fire is allowed to go free, being replaced by butter, with the offering of which the rite ends, unless it is stopped sooner at the carrying round of the fire. 

11. Other Forms of Jyotistoma 

The ritual texts rank the Agnistomaas the first form of the series of Somasacrifices which bear the generictitle of Jyotistoma. The list is in their view the Atyagnistoma,the Ukthya, the Socjasiri, the Vajapeya, Atiratra, andAptoryama or Aptoryama. The number of the series is seven, and it is mostprobable that the number is simplythe sacred seven, and not a trace of anoriginal view. The Atyagnistoma,the Vajapeya, and the Aptoryama have not the place of forms of the Jyotistoma in the older Samhitas, and probably were added to make up the number to seven.1 

The essential distinction of the Ukthya from the Agnistoma lies in the fact, that at the third pressing of the Soma the number of astras and of Stotras is brought up to five each by the addition of three others, so as to correspond with the five of each which are found in the other two pressings. The Stotras and astras accompany the rounds of gobletsat the other pressings. Further, the astras bear the name Uktha or Ukthya of the Ukthya cups which are given to Indra and Varu^a, Indra and Brhaspati, and Indra and Visjiu, andnot to the same deities as at the morning and afternoon pressings. The nameof the sacrifice is of obscure origin: the more probable view is that it was so called, because there was a discussion as to whether the Ukthya cup in its three portions was to be used at the third pressing: the question would then be a disputed one and the sacrifice, in which they were used, would be called that with the Ukthya or more shortly Ukthya.2 The Samans of the extra 1 ApfS. xiv. 1-4 ; B^S. xvii. 1-10 ; KS. xivff. ; Keith, Taittirtya SamhiM, i.

Stotras seem to have been the S&kamagva, Saubhara, and Narmedha. Afurther difference lies in the fact that there is a change of Samans at the Prstha Stotras of the mid-day pressing: in the first and the third of these the Brhatand yaita replace the Rathantara and Naudhasa, while the second and the fourth retain the old Samans, Vamadevya and Kaleya. There is also a second victim, a he-goat for Indra and Agni, for the day of the pressing. 

The Socjagin1 differs from the precedingrite by the addition of a ram for Indra, and by the possession of a sixteenth cup, which is offered at the morningpressing or at all three, as the last of the Dharagrahas. It is accompanied bya special Stotra and astra making the number up to sixteen, with the fifteen of the Ukthya, and, in accordance with this increase, there are also four sets o* goblets in place of three as at the Ukthya. The Soma cow has to be of verj small stature and have red ears. The Soc^in cup is treated with special care : it is placed in a square vessel of Khadira wood, addressed as soon as it is put on the Vedi, and, in giving the signal for the commencement of the Stotra when the sun is half set, a gold pieceis handed to the UdgStr in place of the usual piece of grass. The sacrificial fee is a reddish brown horse or a female mule. 

The Atyagnistoma is closely connected with the Sodagin, though in the view of the ritual texts it is treated as if it were simply an Agnistoma with anextra Stotra and astra. It is really a Sodasin in which the three Stotras and

astras of the Ukthya, and of course the corresponding goblets and Ukthyacup, are omitted. Its real placein the ritual is not as a separatesacrifice at all, but as the form of service on the tenth day of a Daaratra, a periodof ten days, which with an Atiratra before and after it makes up the common form of a Dvadaaha rite : it must in all probability be treated as a variant form, pro duced by those theologians who did not approve the addition of the three Stotras and Qastrasat the Ukthya rite. 

The Atiratra attains the number of twenty-nine Stotras and fastras byadding a series of twelve of both, which are used to accompany three rounds, Paryayas, each of four sets of goblets, which in turn are led off by that of the Hotr, Maitravaruna, Brahmanaechaftsin, and Achavaka. The offerings are made during this nocturnal carouse, which gives the name to the rite, to Indra 

Apiarvara. When the Cups have been duly offered and the priests havedrunk, then the Sandhi Stotra is performed, while a cake is made ready for the A9vins, the name of the Stotra being derived from the twilight, which is about to break. It has nine verses and is sung to the Rathantara tune. Thenfollows the Prataranuvaka to the A9vins, which must contain a thousand verses or more, or a thousand Brhati verses, made up artificially from other metres :2 the last verse is to be said after sunrise. Then the Adhvaryu takes the cup of the Hotr, the other assistants of the Adhvaryu the rest, and with the Soma

336 Vedic Ritual [Partm  

from the previous night, a cup is offered tothe Avins, while the Pratiprasthatr offers the cake. There is also a fourth animal victim, a he-goat for Sarasvatl. The Atiratra might, it is clear, be performed without the Socja^in cup andthe corresponding Stotra and astra, but this is not the prevailing view. It lasted with its nocturnal continuation over the night, and so can be considered as the tail of the sacrifice, which laps over from the end of the month into the next month.1 

The Aptoryama is classed sometimes with the Atiratra as an Ahina, that is a rite lasting more than a day, instead of as an Ekaha like the other forms of the Jyotistoma. It is marked out from the Atirfitra by the addition after the Sandhi Stotra and the A$vina fastra of four more Stotras and astras, 

accompanying four sets of gobletsfor the priests which are drawn for Agni, Indra, the All-gods, and Visnu, or according to others for the deities of the Sandhi goblets. As an independent rite, it is practically unknown : it is, however, occasionally mentioned with other forms of one day ceremonies. 

The last form of the Jyotistoma is the Vajapeya, which is of special nature and will be treated below. 

12. Other Soma Sacrifices of One Day's Duration. 

The Agnistoma is the model on which innumerable2 other kinds of sacrifice can be formed, in order to bring about certain desires. The Vi^vajit3 is occasionally mentioned : in it a man gives all his goods as the fee, or at least a thousand cattle and hundred horses. In the former case he first hands over to his eldest son his share in the property. After the offering he spends twelve nights in different places, three where an Udumbara is, eatingfruits and roots only, three among Nisadas, without eating the grains cultivated by them, +hrftf! with folk^and^three with folk like himself, or according to another vieweither Vai9yas or Rajany*~. The symbolic nature of the rite is obvious. 

The six Sadyafckras4 are offerings which in one day include all the rites, including the Diksa from the beginning to the end of a Soma sacrifice. Thefirst serves as a model of the rest : the priests, Hotr, Udgfi.tr, Adhvaryu, andBrahman, are stationed in the four quartersat considerable distances : the altar is a sown field, or field full of ripe barley or rice : the Uttaravedi a threshing-floor. Milk is churned into butter in a skin by the primitive mode of shaking it. The offeringis supposed to bring the attainment of heaven, of cattle, and of the defeat of a rival. The second removes disease, and brings strength sgid food. The fourth is the Vi9vajit filpa, at which one should give as many fees as possible ; the fifth is the yena, which is employed for

exorcism, and the fee in this case consists of one-eyed lame cattle without horns or tails, mixed with diseased ones.1 

Of special importance are the four Vratya Stomas,2 which are rites apparently intended for the admission into the Brahmanical community of persons who though Aryans have been living outside that community. It is in the ritual said to be intended for the case of persons who have lost their position as twice born by various reasons, including living among non-twice born people. Of such peopleit is said that they do not study, do not practise agriculture or trade ; they call good words bad, perhaps a reference to differ ences of dialect, they punish the guiltless with blows, presumably an allusion to difference of law, and, though uiiconsecrated, speak the speechof the con secrated. According to the views of Katyayana,the first offering is for Vratyas, who, skilled in dance, song, and music, are capableof teaching these arts to a company ofVratyas, the second for eunuchs, the third for those of little account, and the fourth for old impotent men. The dress of the Vratyas is described as including a special kind of turban (usmfa), white garments with black fringes, and a curious kind of bow without a string (jydhroda): at the rite also is used a special sort of cart (vipalha), and a silver ornament as worn by Vratyas. The Grhapati, who is to be chosen from the leader of the Vratyas to be con verted, carries two skins, one white, one black, and a pair of shoes,, black andshaped like ears, or provided with ears. All these articles are to be given as a fee at the proper time to an unworthy Brahman from Magadha, a sign that Magadha was not regarded as strictly Brahmanical, or to Vratyas who havenot yet been converted, and who are thus made scapegoats. When the ceremony is over, the Vratyas cease to have that characteristic : they becomeadmitted to full membership of the Brahmanical society, and can engage in the pursuit of sacred learning. 

The rites are specially interesting, as they mention several words whichare not easily explicable, and evidently were not well understood at a very early date : they may be borrowed from the speech of the eastern tribes, andtogether with the mention of the Brahman from Magadha suggest, but donot prove, that the Vratyas came from the east rather than from the west, though we know that the western tribes were by no means fully Brahmanized,8

and it has been suggested that the Vratyas represented one or other of the many Aryan tribes which were in motion in the period 1500-1000 B.C. Thereare clear traces that the Udgatrs were specially active in the business of bringing in these outlying members of the Brahmanical society : possibly this may stand in some relation to the fact that the Chandogas were never held in the highest repute among the Vedic Indians.1 The suggestionof Charpentiera that we are to see in these Vratyas adherents of Rudra-iva must be regarded as impossible. It is, however, of interest to note that already in the Athar vaveda 3 the Vratya is a well-known figure, and by the curious ideas of that Veda is turned into an expression of the supreme deity. 

Of other rites of this class the Upahavya4 is interesting, as it is born of strife between the gods and the Asuras, and in it the names of the gods are carefully changed to avoid mentioning them aloud : thus the name of Indra is 

akra, of Soma Indu, and likewise the hota deva is changed to hold yakse, and so on, even the simple word sarva, all, becoming the old vi$va. There is a rite, the Sarvasvara,5 for one who wishes to die : the sacrificer in it is com pletely covered over and sits facing south on a dark skin. In the Brhaspatisavs on the other hand, which is offered by one who wishes such rank as a Puru hitaship, the sacrificer must be treated with respect, be greeted by others with out returning the salutation, and be styled Sthapati,'lord ', all these things bysympathetic magic working the desired end. If the Apacitis7 are offered to bring a man honour, he must pay dearly in Daksiiias in proportion to what he aspires to attain, and so in all these offerings the greed of the priest for fees shows itself. 

The Gosava is of special interest, because it involves incest with one's mother, sister, and a woman of one's own Gotra, that is with whom marriage is forbidden. The Jaiminiya Brahmana 8 records that Janaka of Videhadeclined to undertake it, though it would have secured him the world of the Ox, doubtless Prajapati as in the Atharvaveda,9 but a ibi king did perform it, carrying out literally the rule of acting according to nature.

13. The Vajapeya or Drink-of-Strength 

The Vajapeya A is of especial interest in that it preserves, despite the formalism imposed upon it by its inclusion in the Soma ritual, many traces of very popular origin. It is said by many authorities to be a festival of the autumn, and it is also allowed either to perform it independently, or as the sixth day of a Sarvamedha or universal sacrifice. It consists of one pressing day and at least 13 days of consecration and three Upasad days, so that it 

takes up at least 17 days and may be spun out to a year.It adds to the ordinary Sodacin form a seventeenth Stotra and astra, and the numberseventeen is also introduced into the Bahispavamana and Madhyandinapa vamana Stotras in place of the Trivrt and Pancadaga Stomas there normallyused. The number of cups in the ordinary rite is increased by the addition of the An$u and Adabhya, and also five Vajapeya or Aindra cups ; there are added a dappled barren cow for the Maruts, and seventeen goats for Prajapati, hornless but capable of procreation. The sacrificer, his wife, and the priest all wear garlands of gold, which form the fees. The special features of the rite begin with the midday pressing, at which a warrior with seventeen arrows measures out a course for a race, marking the place where the last falls with a twig of Udumbara. Then three horses of the sacrificer are yoked to his chariot, sixteen others are yoked with four horses each, and the sacrificer is victorious in a formal race, during which 17 drums are beaten, and the Brahman climbs up a post, on which is fastened a wheel of Udumbara wood,to sing the Saman of the strong steeds, while the wheel is turned to the right. The horses are given, before and after the race, the offering to Brhaspati to smell, to gain its strength. In the second place, along with the cupsof Somathere are offered by the Nestr alternatively cups of Sura, which are purchased from a long-haired man and placed in a special place. Mention is also madeof a cup of honey, which is not used for any offering, but is placed in the handof a Ksatriya or Vai$ya competitor, and seems to be an unintelligible remainder of an older rite. In the third place, the sacrificer for himself and his wife solemnly mounts to the sun by climbing with the aid of a ladder to the top of the sacrificial post which is decorated by placing on it a wheel-shaped garland of meal, in which position he is touched by the priest or others with salt in Avatthaleaves. He then descends and sits on a throne, and is sprinkled with a mixture of water, milk, and seventeen other substances, or so many as can be thought of, with the exception of one of which he never again eats. Therest of the mixture is used for certain libations called Vajaprasavlya, and the festival closes with seventeen Ujjitis,4 benedictions \ which can be accom panied by libations.

The name of the offeringis explained by tradition as*food and drink ', by Oldenberg*as* the drink of strength ', and by Weber as* the protection of strength '. The last rendering is clearly to be rejected: the drink which Weber denies to be seen in the offeringis the Soma, and we cannot assume that the name is older than the use of Soma in the rite. It is importantto note that the rite could, it is clear from scattered notices, be used by a Vaicya and not 

merely by a Brahman or a Ksatriya, but it is also clear that the offering wasconnected with the attainment of high prosperity, and it may well be that it was intended to be offered only by one who was in the technical sense a gatapri, * who had attained prosperity ', and so could aspire to highest things. More over, this is indicated by the fact that the person who performsthis offering is not expected to take notice of persons who have not done so, go behind them, or share a bed with them. The nature of the rites is clearly on the one hand that of the attainment of victory and power by the symbolicacts of winning, of being hailed as victor, and anointing: references to fertility are obvious also, and the sun spell of the wheel is noteworthy.It is accordingly impossible to lay down precisely the original character of the rite :2 it was not merely the feast of victoryof the winner in a chariot race, such as might be paralleled in Greek ritual, nor was it solely an agriculturalrite : it has been blended by a mixture of many elements to form a general offering available for any successful person. 

This curious position of the Vajapeya clearly led to confusion : some texts place it above the Rajasuya, and saythat by the latter mere kingshipis con ferred, by the former paramount lordship. But other texts make the Vajapeyaappropriate for a paramount lord, and the Rajasuya for a universal monarchlike Varuna.3 The simplestsolution is that which makes the Vajapeya a rite which is performed by the kingbefore the Rajasuya and by the Brahmanbefore the Brhaspatisava.4 The essential priestly character of the rite as it stands is shown by the prominenceof Brhaspati and the part played by Praja 

pati. 

Other special forms of sacrifices for obtaining a special rank are the Suta, Gramanl, Sthapati, and Go-Savas.B 

14. The Royal Consecration 

The royal consecration6 is a Soma sacrifice having the usual Diksa andUpasad days and preceded by a long series of preparatoryrites. It is mythi cally connected with the consecration of Varuna or with Indra, and it

displays many popularelements in its character, as was inevitable from its nature. The great nobles and office bearers of the court piny an important part, the JPurohita performs many of the priestly functions, the peopleare at least present to hear the announcement of the consecration of the sovereign. It connects itself with Vedic history: the tribes who are mentioned are the Bharatas or their successors in blood and tradition, the Kuru-Pancalas. Thepreliminary ceremonies begin with the first day of Diksa on the 1st Phalguna, followed by offerings to Anumati and to Nirrti, who receives the fallen portions of the grain on a salt piece of ground in the south. With the 15th of the month commence the observances for a year of the four-month offerings, the periods between the new- and full-moon days being filled up either by the new and full-moon offerings or offerings to the sun and the moon. These offerings cease with the unasmya offering on the 1st Phalguna of the following year, and on that and the next two days offerings are made to the deities of the quarters, and others, and then on the 4th to the 15th offerings called the Ratninam HavIAsi, which are offered in the houses of thecjewels'of the king,1 his wives and high officers, the deities chosen being the appropriate gods for the persons in whose houses the offerings are made, as for Aditi in that of the chief queen, for Nirrti in that of the discarded lady. After these follow various libations, and on the 1st of Caitra comes the day of anointing, which is per formed as an Ukthya rite. There are offered on it eight offerings to the divine instigators, who are to pay heed to the crowning of the princein the rite. The actual anointingtakes placeafter the Marutvatlya cups : seventeen kinds of waters, brought from the Sarasvatl, drawn against the current of the stream, or with it, &c., are used : they are sieved after mixing and pouredinto four vessels, of Pala^a, Udumbara, Nyagrodha, and A9vattha. The sacrificer clad in splendid raiment takes from the Adhvaryu a bow with three arrows, andis proclaimed with the Avid formulae which he repeats announcing his anointment. The evil spirits are appeased by the gift of copper placedin the mouth of a long-haired man. The sacrificer then strides to the various quarters, and steps on a tiger-skin, beneath which is a piece of lead, on which he tramps as on the head of Namuci. With gold under his feet and a goldfillet over his head, he is anointed by the Adhvaryu in front, and also by a kinsman, a Rajanya, and a Vai?ya, representing the whole people. After this are per formed six Partha libations which are offered to correspond with six before the anointing ;2 the king steps on the skin the steps of Visnu and putsin the

Pal.a dish the remains of the mixture, which he hands to his eldest son, that he may continue his work and strength. An offeringis also made in which the names of the father and son are first confused, then rightlysaid.,A mimicexpedition for booty is performed : the king in his chariot goes out against cattle of his kinsfolk : at the time of the fees he plunders them and they surrender their belongings : a third of their goods goesto the priest, a third to the drinkers of the Da$apeya, and the owners are allowed to have a third back. But they also receive villages, and are called Rajanyas, but unworthyof anointing.1 In another account,2 which does not in this interesting waybring out the conceptionof the pretendersto the royal throne and their defeat, the king mounts his horse and advances to the quarters, a parallel to whichis quoted from the ceremony of coronation of the King of Hungary. Before descending from the chariot which he mounts for the fray, the king puts onsandals of boar's hide, and praysneither to injure the earth, nor be injured by it, a clear allusion to his high sanctity. After the later Kesavapanlyarite he never stands with bare feet on the ground. He then sits on a throne placed over the tiger-hide, and takes five dice from the Adhvaryu : the priest gently beats him from behind with sticks of pure trees, doubtless to expel anytaint of ill. 3 Before the dicing begins the Purohita hands the king a woodensword, which he passes on to his brother, and through him it is taken by a manwho marks out the placefor dicing, where a hut is erected. After the dicing, which is merely formal and which deliberately was so carried out as to makethe king a victor, the sacrifice progresses to the normal end, but the bath is followed by an offering to Indra and Visnu of a special nature. Then comesthe preparation for the Da9apeya offering, for which the Diksa consists in ten Samsrpam Havmsi. The offeringitself seems to have been in origin an inde pendent offering : it is performed on the 7th of Caitra : the performers musthave ten generationsof Soma drinkers : from ten cupsten drink together at each : it is uncertain if the relatives of the king may drink or not, but he certainly has a goblet. After this, according to some authorities, the king, the people save the Brahmans, and the steeds may not have their hair cut for a year. There are also a number of minor offerings to propitiate the quarters, to

win the seasons, for Aditi or the Adityas, and the Maruts or the All-gods. In Jyaistha follows in the next year the ceremony of the cuttingof the hair, the Ke9avapaniya, which may be followed by two Vyusti offerings a fortnight later, and the Ksatradhrti, a month later, a rite interesting as it is connected with the ruin of the Kurus.1 The fees are exaggerated beyond measure, even 240,000 cows being given. 

The rite is full of magic and symbolism : its nature is obvious and has in numerable parallels: it is worth noting that the kingis expectedto rub in the substance of the anointing mixture with the horn of a black antelope: it is thus clear that the holy strengthis actually in the mixture, and must be madeto impregnate the system ; the keeping of the long hair, like the Frankish kings, is to preserve for a time this holiness. The position and prominenceof the game of dice 2 are interesting: it is possible to see in it a connexion with the foretelling of prosperity, but it must have been made the more natural in that the king was interested, we may believe even at this period,in the revenue to be derived from dicing, which was carried on in the Sabha,k house of assembly ', and which in later times was assuredly a valuable monopoly, and probably so 

in earlier days. 

Different forms of consecration are referred to : the Aitareya Brahmana8 distinguishes the great consecration, Abhiseka, of Indra from the renewed con secration of a consecrated king, and its account of the consecration, whichdeals only with the anointing,differs very greatly from that of the Yajurveda, which it possibly presupposes. Great stress is laid on the fact that the king is only given a curious mixture to drink, being absolutely denied the use of Soma, a fact explained by a long mythological story. 

15. The Horse Sacrifice 

The horse sacrifice4is in the ritual reckoned an Ahina, that is a rite with more than one day on which the Soma is pressed,in this case three. It is anold and famous rite, which kingsalone can bring, to increase their realms : wehave lists of the great kingsof old5 who were consecrated and who performed the horse sacrifice. The horse chosen must be swift, in front black, behind white, and with a dark mark. The offering begins on the 8th or 9th of Phalguna or in summer. On that day a mess of rice is cooked for the priests, and the king, his four wives, and their four hundred maidens of different ranks

assemble, the king spendingthe nightat the Garhapatya fire. Next morningthe horse is bound, and sprinkledin standing water : a man of low class kills with a club of Sidhraka wood a four-eyed dog, and lets it float on a mat underthe horse. The sacrificer says,fe He who will kill the horse attacks Varuria : away the man, away the horse !' * The horse is then led back to the fire, andofferings are made of cakes to Savitr in various forms for three days. Thehorse is then set free to wander with a hundred old horses, and guarded byfour hundred youths of the same relative rank as the ladies of the queen, whoare armed with armour, with swords, arrows, or sticks accordingto their rank, as princes, warriors, sons of heralds and headmen, and sons of atten dants and charioteers. They must guard the horse from any danger,in cluding bathing and intercourse with mares, doubtless acts calculated to reduce its sanctity of power. The princes among them are promisedthe royal consecration as the reward for success. If any ill fall upon the horse, it must be atoned for : if it dies, a new horse is found and some ceremonies repeated. During the period of its absence the priests and the sacrificer sit on golden thrones : the Hotr begins the telling of the cyclic2 narrative, Pariplava Akhyana, the telling of tales, Akhyanas, of ancient kings, which last by series of ten days for the whole year. At the end of the performancethe Adhvaryu offers in the Daksina fire libations for the movements of the steed, and in the Ahavaniya, after sunset, the Dhrti libations to secure the success of the rite : at his bidding a lute player, a Rajanya, sings to the lute three Gathas, verses, made by himself which refer to victories in battle connected with the sacrificer. All the performances repeat themselves dailyfor a year, or six months, or even for half a month, if the periodis reduced. When the horse returns, the king, who has been celebrated hitherto with the kings of the past, is from the Diksa day of the new sacrifice hailed as with the gods, and on the three pressing days proper with Prajapati. The first pressing day3 falls on the full moon of Vai9akha : there are 21 posts and 21 victims for Agniand Soma : on the days of pressing the victims are two sets of eleven each. The second pressing day is the most important. The Stotra is started at the neighing of a horse in the morning : after the astra of the Hotr, three other horses are yoked with the sacrificial horse, and are driven to bathe. On the return of the horses the victim is anointed by the chief of the queens, and 101 gold pieces placed in its mane and tail. It is given the remains of an offering made the previous night ; but, if it will not eat them, they are cast into water. Then take place curious riddles between the Brahman and the Hotr, the Brahmodya.4 Then the victims are bound to the posts,in all 327 or 849 tameanimals and a large number of wild animals from the elephant to the bee,

making 609 in one version. The large numbers, especially of the wild animals, which were, however, to be let go after the fire had been carried round them, are suspicious : the best defence1 to be made is that there was need of large numbers for the festival to follow the sacrifice. The horse is covered with a garment and slain : the queens go round it from left to right thrice, and thrice vice versa : the chief queen goes near the horse : both are covered with a garment, and the queen unites with it : meanwhile the priest and the maidens and the other wives indulge in ribald dialogue. Then the horse and the other victims are cut up. The blood is cooked, the omentum offering of the ordinary ritual prepared : before it another Brahmodya between Hotr and Adhvaryu, Brahman and Udgatr, sacrificer and Adhvaryu, takes place. The rest of the horse is cooked, the blood offered at the end of the Svistakrt offering and also on other occasions. Before the Svistakrt offering the cooked flesh is offered to Prajapati, and at the end of the second day offerings are made, through the night, of various plants. 

The offerings of the third day are followed by the final bath, in which is performed the curious rite of an offering on the head of a man already referred to. 2 The fees are givenin various forms : the conquered land is to be divided : even the wives of the sacrificer are sometimes demanded : the Adhvaryuapparently obtains a daughter in wedlock, and also the fourth wife. 

The Rigveda 3clearly knows this greatest of all Vedic sacrifices, though it is certain that the holocaust of victims was not then usual ; only a goat appears to lead the way for the horse, and, though this is not conclusive, still it makesit doubtful whether the early ritual had the large number of victims offered. The victims too seem to be led round the fire, not vice versa. But it is clear that the offering was already a Soma sacrifice, and that in essence the rite wasknown : reference is also made to the use of gold and the cloths for decking the steed. 

The meaning of the sacrifice is in the former view of Oldenberg4 the offering to Indra, the god of the warriors, of a swift strong steed from whichthe sacrificer would thus derive magic power, whether directly or indirectly through the fact that Indra would thus be made strongto aid him. Theslaying of the dog he thinks intended as the destruction of hostile powers, or perhaps in origin as providingthe horse with a guardian ; such a function is sometimes given to a four-eyed dog in the Avesta. The relation of the queenand the horse is clearly a fertility spell, while the obscene language, he thinks, might be explained in the same sense, or as an amusement of the gods, or a

a Part III, Chap. 18, 8. observes, however, that in RV. x. 56 *i. 162 and 168. a horse sacrifice to the dead occurs, Rel. des Veda1, pp. 806, 856, 478-5. His which may be the imitation of the later view (pp. 478 f.) makes the rite horse sacrifice or its prototype.

mere relic of the plain speech of the crowd* In the view of Eggelinga the horse, the next animal to man in the scale, is the appropriate offering on great occasions : at the sacrifice the steed can be identified with Prajapati, andso Prajapati comes properly into the ritual. On the other hand he points out that the horse is connected with Varuna, in that the horse is the sun horse which traverses the heaven, which is Varuna and is conceived as a sea of waters, so that the horse is sprung from the waters. Varuna may, therefore, have been the earlier deityof the offering. 

The original force of the rite is somewhat obscure. The possibility of comparison with the October horse at Rome 2 is obvious, and the eating of the horse, the fertility rite in which it appears, and the obscenity of the conversa tion, point to a vegetation ritual, but the absence of any suggestion that the horse was a vegetation spirit, or that its body was in part used for a direct vegetation magic, is against that theory. In the view of von Negelein,8 the offering was one made to the sun conceived as a steed, in order to strengthen him for his course in the heaven. As Indra with his steed defeats the Asuras, so the earthly king by the horse sacrifice, uniting himself mysteriously with the sacrificial horse and its magic power, defeats the Asuras. Indra's horse is the thunderbolt which slays Vrtra, and so the human horse aids the king to defeat his enemies. Varuna then, and later Prajapati, were given by tradition the ownership of the horse, first connected with Indra. The difficulty of this theory is to see exactly why the horse is connected with Indra. He is not the sun in Vedic and probably not even in pre-Vedic myth. On the other handVaruna is the god of the waters port^excellence: the waters in many lands arc conceived as horses, both sea and fresh waters being so regarded : to rivers andthe sea horses arc offered as in Greece : Indra would then not be the primary figure in the myth as von Negelein holds, but a natural intruder in the rite. The most attractive alternative to this view is undoubtedly the acceptance of the sun as the sun horse,4 offered originally to the sun as a spell to strengthen it, and the chief difficulty in that view is merely the fact that the sun is not the recipient of the offering, in any measure. If he were actually offered to, it

would be easy to understand the placeof Indra : that Indra should have com pletely superseded him is odd, but on the whole the explanation of the horse as the sun steed seems the most plausible. It is at least certain that in the Vajasaneyi Samhita the steed was regarded in the rite as identical with Dadhikravan whose sun character is not to be doubted.1Perhaps the true solution lies in the view that two rites are confused, the offering of a horse to the sun and of a horse to Varuna as god of the waters. Prajapati must in anycase be deemed to be a later addition to the rite. It is of course possible that the position of Varuna was not won until after he had become prominentin the ritual of the final bath, and that then he appropriated in part the sacrifice of the steed. 

16. The Human Sacrifice 

The human sacrifice as prescribed in two of the ritual texts2 is based closely on the horse sacrifice ; while there the chief victims are the horse, a Gomrga, and a hornless goat, here a man is added, a Brahman or Ksatriya bought at the price of a thousand cows and a hundred cattle, and he is per mitted like the horse a year of freedom, in which he can do as he wishes, save that he must remain chaste. The offeringis to be performed by a Brahman

or a Ksatriya who is not successful. When slain, the chief queen must lie beside the victim as beside the horse : the attempt to find a reference to this* practice in the Rigvcda3 is a failure. On the other hand the nominal offering 

of large numbers of other men, 166 at 11 posts,is mentioned by the atapatha Brahmana,4 but we have every reason to assume that this is mere priestly imagination, unless, as is possible, the conceptions of the priest were occa sionally made real by a king.It is laid down 5 that a king may on this occasion give up his goods and enter into the life of the wandering mendicant, but this seems merely to have been a facultative rule. It must, however, be noted that the rite of an actual slaying of man is not described in the Brahmanas at all : there is in the atapatha and the Taittiriya and their Sutras merely the symbolic offering of men, who are let free like the wild animals at the horse sacrifice, and therefore the actual offering rests merely on Sutra evidence, the Vaitana and ankhayana, and not even on the early Sutras. It is not credible that the Brahmanas should have passed over the rite if they had actually known of it ; its mention in the later Sutras is consistent only with the invention of it, as a reasonable complement to the theory of sacrifice which saw an anomaly in the omission of man from the victims.6

348 Vedic Ritual [Part III   

No other trace of human sacrifice exists in the Vedic literature apart from the quite different case of the use of a man and four other victims as anoffering at the piling of the greatfire altar.1 This usage is not actuallylaid down for the contemporary time by any Brahmana : the most contemplated is the use of the head of a man who has been slain by lightning or by an arrow shot, not a victim killed for the purpose, and normally the head of a goat seems to have sufficed. But it is clearly no real sacrifice at all. The legendof 

unahepa, which has been thought to embody an old legendof humansacrifice which was later abolished, and for which the recitation of the story suffices when recited to the king at the royal consecration, has been noted above ; its essential feature of the horror of the proposed offering, whether the victim is the son of the kingor merely a priest, and the view thus taken is quite incompatible with the idea that the actual human sacrifice was per formed in Vedic India.2 

17. Other Ahina Rites 

While the human sacrifice occupiesfive pressing days, the universal sacri fice, Sarvamedha,3 takes ten, and it is modelled on the offering made of him self by Brahman Svayambhu, in the beginningof things.Its relation to the human sacrifice is held to be the perfectionof the former : at the humansacrifice, according to ankhayana, the offerer gives away the kingdomwith the people : at this he gives the earth away also, and in Hillebrandt's* viewthe rite marked the act by which the king left the royal life for the ascetic, as the Buddha afterwards did. It is, however, difficult to take the offering seriously : it is based on myth, and seems no more than a purely priestly fiction : this is borne out by the fact that it is mentioned only in the latest Sutras, though it figures in the legendof Naciketas. 

There are many other forms of the Ahina rite, with more than one and not more than twelve pressing days, making up at most with the Upasads, &c., not over a month. The number of variations is very large indeed, and the different forms are given names, accordingto the families or individuals whoinvented or practised them. Of their make-up the most importantrule is that they must end with an Atiratra rite, and in all the days of the Abhiplava andPrthya Sacjahas are usually broughtinto account : of these further particu lars will be given below. 

Apart, however, from mere priestly inventions, there are clear traces of popular rites : the most interestingis the aballhoma,6performedin spring to increase the herds. The sacrificer cuts hair and beard, puts on an unused

garment, lies twelve nights on an uncovered elevated spot, and drinks hot milk. The fire in his house must be kept burning : no one, save a friend to give him the directions to performhis functions, must accompany him : he must say little and keep close. On the morning of the twelfth day he offers a libation of honey and sour milk with a formula addressed to faball. Before the voices of beingsare heard, he goes from the village to a wood where he can

hear none of the sounds of the village animals, takes a bunch of grass andcries thrice with loud voice'aball': if any animal other than a dog or an ass replies, his sacrifice will be successful. If no answer comes he repeats the performance a year later ; if, however, at the third time there is no reply, or an ass or dog answers his first appeal, he will have no success. In the view of Henry,1 abali is the personified cloud, of varied hue, whose purpose can beexpressed by the cow rich in milk. Originally a rain spell, the rite wasdeveloped for more general purposes. The Pancavir^a Brahmana,8 however, treats abalf,the wonder cow, as representing V&c, speech. 

18. The Sattras or Sacrificial Sessions 

The rite of twelve days, Dvada^aha,8may be performed either as anAhina or a Sattra, and all rites with more than twelve pressing days are Sattras : the number of years they may be continued extends to thirty-six 

or more up to 1,000. The Sattras all differ from other forms of the Somasacrifice, because all the performers must be consecrated and must be Brah mans : there is therefore no separatesacrificer : all share in the benefits of the offering : each bears the burden of his own errors, whereas at the ordinary sacrifice the sacrificer receives the benefit and the evil results of errors alike. Moreover, they should usually be Brahmans who performthe same kinds of rites, and have the same deity, Tanunapat or Nara^ansa,at the Apr! invoca tion ; if not, the deity of the majority is adopted. During the Sattra all other sacrifices cease to be performed by the priests taking partin the rite : anysexual intercourse is forbidden, as are swift movements, laughing without holding the hand before the mouth, untruth, connexions with non-Aryans, andso forth. One of them plays the partof sacrificer : the others hold on to himwhen he does those acts which only one man can perform. The Adhvaryuconsecrates the sacrificer, and so on until a student consecrates the Unnetr. The wives of the priests are also consecrated each with her husband. There are no fees : instead the priests go south sayingas they shake black skins, 4 What here from my life departeth, that, O Agada, I bring to thee as a fee,' evidently a device to secure longlife. The aims of the Sattras are most

various : the obtainingof wealth, of cattle, of offspring, of prosperous marriage, and many other things. Much as they are, it is clear, elaborated bythe priest, they reflect here and there primitive conceptionsof sacrifice. 

The model of all Sattras is the Dvadagaha, which is made up of a Praya iya and an Udayanlya, which, as in all Sattras as opposedto Ahmas, mustboth be Atiratra days,as the beginning and concluding rites respectively of a Prsthya Sacjaha, and of either 4 Chandomas or 3 Chandomas and anAvivakya day as the tenth. The name Prsthya is based on the different treatment of the Prstha Stotra of each day correspondingto the astra of the Hotr : on the first it is in the Rathantara tune, on the second the Brhat, the third the Vairupa, the fourth the Vairaja, the fifth the akvara, the sixth the Raivata. Of these days the first and fourth are Agnistomas,the others Ukthyas. The Chandomas are Ukthyas, the tenth is an Atyagnistoma: it is called Avivakya, because on that day no dispute about errors in the ceremonyis allowed.1 A further variation is possible: on the fourth and ninth days the Agrayana cup may be drawn first, on the six and seventh the ukra, in which case the Stotras and the astras must also be transposed, or they may be trans posed without change in the order of the cups : this makes the periodof ten days bear the term vyudhachandas. The Soma is daily watched by one priest, the rest may study the Veda, fetch wood, and eat. The tenth day is marked by interesting rites, the singing of the Saman called the success of the Sattra, and the performanceof a Brahmodya like that at the horse offering or regarding the unqualified Prajapati. 

Rules are givenfor building up the Dvada^aha to longer Sattras ; the simplest addition is that of a Mahavrata day after the periodof ten days : other additions are inserted before that period, the shorter before the longer. But these rules are very much varied in practice. Of the various forms byfar the most interestingis the Gavam Ayana,'the way of the cows ', which is a Sattra of one year's duration. 

The beginning of this Sattra2 is variously prescribed,at the full moon of Phalguna or Caitra, or four days before the full moon of these months or of Magha. The middle day, the Visuvant, divides it into two halves, of which the latter is in many respects intended to be the reverse of the former. The

scheme of the offeringis a Praya^Iya Atiratra, a CaturviAga day on which the twenty-four-fold Stoma is used, the form beingeither an Agnistomaor anUkthya ; five months each of four Abhiplava Sa<Jahas and one Prsthya ; a sixth one of one Prsthya, three Abhiplavas, one Abhijit, an Agnistoma rite, and three Svarasaman days making up 28, to which the first two days are added to complete the month. Then comes the Visuvant. The second half year has as the seventh month three SvarasSmans, one Vi$vajit, one Prsthya, and three Abhiplavas ; then months 8 to 11 have one Prsthya and four 1 Ct Eggeling, SHE. xli. p. xvii ; Keith, xxiv. 4, 5 ; AS. xi. 7 ; xii ;

Abhiplavas each, and the last has three Abhiplavas, one Ayus day, one Go day, one Dacaratra, and the Mahavrata and Udayanlya days. 

The Abhiplava Sa<}aha, which is often used in Sattras of all kinds and also in Ahlnas, differs in certain respects from the Prsthya. In the first place in it the Prstha Stotra is alternatively Rathantara and Brhat only. In the second place the days of the Abhiplava are differentiated as Jyotis, Go, andAyus according to the Stomas used for the different Stotras. The Jyotis form, which is an Agnistoma, having twelve Stotras only, employs for 1-6 the Paftcadaga, for 7-11 the Saptada9a, and for 12 theEkavinsa. The other twoare Ukthyas and have fifteen Stotras : for 1 the Go uses the Paiicada^a, for 2-5 the Trivrt, for 6-10 the Saptada$a, for 11-15 the Ekavinca. The Ayushas for 1 Trivrt, for 2-5 Paficadaca, for 6-10 Saptadaca, and 11-15 Ekavinca.At the Visuvant the sun is honoured with offerings, but the Mahavratax is much more fully known to us. The rite is according to the ritual allowed to be performed variously as a one-day rite, an Ahlna, or in a Sattra, and the latter is its natural place.It is clearly an old festival of the winter solstice, and not even originally, as Hillebrandt holds, of the summer solstice, whenthe strengthening of the sun was an essential duty. There is beaten an earth drum, doubtless to scare away the demons who might attempt to overthrowthe power of the sun ; the Hotr sits on a swing and is swung to and fro, to represent the path of the sun in the sky, and strengthen its power to performit ; ritual abuse is exchanged for fertility purposes, between a student or, in alater usage, a Magadha, and a hetaira ; there is actually carried out sexual intercourse ; the consecrated persons are alternately praised and reviled ; there is a mimic fight between an Aryan and a udra for the possessionof awhite round skin which is declared to be a symbol of the sun ;2 the skin of anunfruitful cow is hung up or stretched out and warriors pierce through it with arrows, perhaps as a rain spell.3 Women celebrate to the sound of the lute in the south the patronsof the ceremony : maids dance round the fire with water pitchers, while the Stotra is being performed : they pour the water onthe fire, and their song shows that they desire richness in milk with water for the cows. The desire of heat and rain seems clearly united : the position of the sun nearest earth is indicated by the priest, who touches the board of the

swing and the earth with one hand, and says,* The God hath united with the 

goddess '.* 

From the pointof view of the priest, most importantelements of the MahSvrata are the Mahavrata Stotra or the Prstha Stotra, corresponding to the Mahaduktha of the Hotr : it is noteworthy for the fact that it is intended to reproduce the form of the fire, the five Samans, the Gayatra, Rathantara, Brhat, Bhadra, and Rajana, are equated to the head, right and left wing, tail 

and body, and accompanied by the Stomas from Trivrt to Paftcavififain order. The later ritual of the fankhayana rauta Sutra identifies the Stotra with the body of a man, showing the influence of the mystic speculations of the priests who performedthe Agnicayana,4piling of the fire ', and who saw in this act the making up of the universal father, the creator god Prajapati,identified 

with the primeval giant who in the Purusasukta is conceived as having, whensacrificed, providedthe material for the whole world.2 

Of other Sattras an interesting one is that performed on the Drsadvati,3 a specially sacred river, and still more that on the Sarasvati, which is markedby many special rites. The sacrifice is performedas the sacrificer movesalong the bank from the place where the Sarasvati disappearsin the desert, across the confluence with the Drsadvati, at the crossing of which an offering is made to Apam Napat, to the place where the stream arises, the Plaksa Prasravana,4 where an offeringis made to Agni as Kama,'desire '. Thesacrifice is accompanied by the driving of a hundred young calves along with a bull into the wood, and is terminated when these have reached the numberof a thousand, or the sacrificer dies, or the cows disappear. At the end of the whole sacrifice, a mare and a woman are givenas a presentto the worthiest of those who have taken partin the performance. The final bath is taken at Karavapacava on the Yamuna. This and the Drsadvati offering are important for the fact that they mention several places of the Kuru land, such as Parinah,5 and indicate the boundaries of that country, the chief home of Brahmanism. 

19. The Sautrdmam 

The Sautramam6 is not a Soma sacrifice, but is classified by the Sutras as a Haviryajfia, though its chief characteristic in its form as recorded is the offering of Sura. It has two distinct forms, the Kaukili, which is an inde pendent offering, the other the Caraka, an offering which forms partof another

offering, as the Rajasuya and the Agnicayana. It is prescribedfor various occasions, but the characteristic ones are the rites for a man who is vomiting Soma, or from whose nose, ears, &c., Soma flows as a result of over-indulgence in the drink. The Caraka form seems clearly a reference to the school of the Black Yajurveda, which is often so named : the view of Hillebrandtl that it alludes to the medical teacher Caraka, in whose school Sura was used as 

medicine, is improbable and unsupported by any evidence. The differences between the two forms are of detail : thus the Kaukili is marked by the singing by the Brahman of certain Samans. The use of the Sura is accom panied by offerings of animals, to Indra a bull, to Sarasvati a sheep, and to the A$vins a goat. These are offered on the fourth day of the rite, which is modelled on the fourth-day Soma sacrifice, along with oblations of milk, of Sura, and of animal fat. The goat for Agni and Soma, which in the Sdtaa sacrifice precedes the pressing day, is replaced by a bull for Agni, and the barren cow at the end of the Soma rite is replaced by a bull for Indra Vayodhas.In the Sura, which is prepared from various kinds of herbs in a wonderful way, are mixed hairs2 of a lion, a tiger, and a wolf, to confer corresponding characteristics on the partakersof the cups of Sura. The Fathers also receive an offering of the Sura. After the libation to Vanaspati in the animal offering, a throne of Munja grass is set down between the two Vcdis, which, as at the Varunapraghasas, are used in this rite, and on this the sacrificer sits downwith silver under his left and gold under his right foot : the offerings, thirty two in number, of fat are then made, while the remainder is used to sprinkle the sacrificer, so that it flows from his mouth. The Adhvaryu then touches the sacrificer, who calls on his servants with their ritual names, and they lift himup first knee high, then navel high, and then as highas the mouth. He then steps on to a tiger-skin as establishing himself in the lordship: the thirty third cup of fat is offered, a Saman is sung, and all join in the finale. A milk offering toMitra and Varuna, and a bull for Indra Vayodhas conclude the rite. 

It is conj ectured by Hillebrandt3 that the rite was taken over by the Indians from a non-Brahmanical tribe, and then remodelled on the basis of the Somaritual : he thinks that the Sura was once a drink akin to the Madhu, andoffered to the A9vins. The A9vins are not prominent as Soma-drinkers, butthey certainly are connected with the Madhu, and the Sura seems from the evidence of the Avesta to have been once a sacred and honoured drink. TheMadhu or Sura cult, he thinks, may have flourished on the banks of the Saras* vati, where the Vasisthas show little anxiety about the Soma cult, and maynot originally have practised it, but have learned it from later intruders. The

hypothesis, however, is not supported by any evidence of value,1 and there are clear traces that the rite was based on myth, that of the effects on Indra of over-indulgencein Soma and the resultingillness which was cured by the efforts of the A^vins and Sarasvati, a fact alluded to in the Rigveda. 

20. The Piling ofthe Fire 

The piling of the fire altar2 is a rite which is regardedas being always available for performance along with the Soma sacrifice, but which is declared to be obligatory onlyin certain cases, including the Mahavrata, and even that view is far from being universally prescribed. There can be no doubt that it 

was by no means a normal or frequentrite : its elaboration is such that noordinary sacrificer would trouble himself with it, and it must have been only occasionally used. The main authorityfor it in the atapatha Brahmanais a different authority from the chief source of rules on the rest of the sacri ficial ritual including the Soma sacrifice, Yajnavalkya : it is attributed to an<Jilya, and others mentioned in connexion with it are Tura Kavaseya,3 who performed it on the K&roti, and Nagnajit Gandhara, names which havebeen held with some force to pointto the North-West, where in conjunction with the fire cult there may have been special activity, perhapsin consequence of contact with Iran. 

The beginning of the sacrifice is the offering of victims, includinga man: the heads are to be built into the altar and the bodies are placedin the water whence the clay for the fire-pan and the bricks of the altar are derived. The clay is solemnly collected with the aid of a horse, an ass, and a goat, a procession being formed to the place which the horse is supposedto deter mine, and the clay being brought formally back. Then the wife of the sacri ficer makes the Asadha brick, and the sacrificer makes the fire-pan and the three Vi^vajyotis bricks. The fire-panis kept filled with fire, from the time of the consecration, which takes place fourteen days after the animal offering, and for a year the sacrificer carries it about, and performsvarious rites, striding the Visnu steps and adoringthe fire in the pan. Then comes the actual ceremony of the buildingof the altar, which is made in five layers, of which the first 4 has 1,950 and the whole together 10,800 bricks, which are given diverse names ; the lengthof time used in the rite differs greatly: the first four layers may occupy eight months and the last four, or a few days may suffice. Noteworthy features of the buildingare the placingin the lowest layer of a golden figure of a man, which seems to be meant as symbolic 1 Bloomfield, JAOS. xv. 193 ff. ; Keith, TaiUirlya Samhitd, i. pp. cxxv ff.

of Agni, who is thus as it were put bodily in the altar, while a tortoise is also immured alive,1 and addressed as a mystic being. After the altar has beenerected, there are 425 libations for the Rudras, made of all sorts of wild plants. The mode of cooling the altar is also noteworthy : the Adhvaryudraws lines on the altar with a reed to which a flag, a twig of Vetaa, and anAvaka plant, all things closely connected with the waters, are tied. Theformal placing of fire on the altar is carried out with much ceremony : the priest and the sacrificer step upon the altar : milk of a black cow with a white calf is offered on the last-deposited naturally perforated brick, the fire-brand is deposited on it, and special wood is used to kindle it. Then come a numberoflibations, for Vaigvanara, for the forty-nine winds, which are to be as helpful to the sacrificer as they were formerly for Indra, the shower of wealth libations, 372 libations for Agni, thirteen for the names of the months, sixteen again for Agni, the Partha offering, one introduced by the mythical king Prthi Vainya2 at his royal consecration, and fourteen Vajaprasaviyas, whose remnants mixedwith milk and water serve to anoint the sacrificer, who, according as he touches the altar or stands or sits, uses a black antelope-skin as a carpet, or a goat-skin, has certain wishes fulfilled. After the anointing, follow six further Partha oblations, twelve Rastrabhrts, and three oblations to the winds, which are offered in the place of the horses of the chariot, and treated as if they werehorses. The first pressing day of the rite is marked by the yoking of the fire before the Prataranuvaka, and by its releasing with appropriate formulae at night. To the ordinary rites of the Soma sacrifice are added offerings to the minor deities, Anumati, Kuhu, Raka, Sinivali, and for Dhatr at the Udaya nlya Isti, and at the very end of the final libations an offering of milk for Mitra and Varuna. The performer of the pilingis subjected to certain taboos : he may not go out in the rain, nor eat the flesh of a bird, the altar being deemedto be of bird or human form, nor have relations with any save a wife of the same caste : after a second offering of the Agnicayana, which is permissible if the first has not good results, he may only have relations with his own wife, and after a third not even with her. In these cases the obvious meaning is that the sacrificer is to avoid wasting in any way the sacred power of the fire, which is within him, and which might be dispersed uselessly, while he mustnot eat the bird which is the symbol of the fire. 

There can be little doubt that this vast ceremonial is not a simple or primitive rite : it is a definite attempt of the priest to embody in the ritual the conception already found in the Rigveda3 of the creation of the universe from the dismemberment of the primeval giant, which requires as its comple ment the process of building up the fire altar, which is a symbol of the universe, and of the cosmic sacrifice which is eternally repeated.It falls, therefore, to be considered below as an important expressionof the theory of sacrifice of

the Brahmans : much as there is of magic and many offerings as there are in the ritual, it is essentiallyin conception the embodiment of philosophic theory, a fact which explainsits loose connexion with any real sacrifices.1 

21. The Hotr Formulae 

The ritual requiresin many places the use of the Hotr formulae, which are formulae in which the priests are mentioned as beingidentical with deities and other objects, the formulae being distinguished accordingto the numberof priests so mentioned as Caturhotr, Paiicahotr, and so on. They are termed offerings, because they represent various sacrifices from the Agnihotra to the Soma offering inclusive. They are often used in the course of important rites, in which case they are normally assigned to the sacrificer, but also they can be employed independently,either by themselves or with the accompanimentof cups of some offering and the cry Svaha. Thus a man, who wishes cattle, must for twelve nights drink hot water, put on a fresh garment and sleep onthe ground. Early next morning he goes east, says the Da^ahotr, and offers the Caturhotr with butter. They can even be used as spells, in which case anoffering is made on salt ground,or a break in the earth, and in placeof the ordinary Vasat-call harsh words like khat or phatare used. This use is clearly an abuse : the formulae are of the nature of Upanisads, and must be treated as representing the desire to substitute mental processesfor the tedious ness of the sacrifice. But it was inevitable that even they should sink to magic uses. 2 

22. The Expiations 

In the intolerable complicationsof the Vedic sacrifice, coupled with the tendency to inaccuracy of the Indian mind of the Vedic period, may be found ample excuse for the number of prescriptions which are laid down for the purpose of expiatingerrors in the sacrifice.3 In some cases the expiationsare 

elaborate in the extreme : in most they are fairly simple. Of the former the most notorious case is that of the Kusmancja,4 which serves as a means of purification from grave sins, and which is dealt with in detail in the Taittirlya Aranyaka, whereas most of the other expiationsare confined to the Sutras or to the later portionsof the Brahmanas. 

Of these expiations the most interesting are givenin the Kau9ika Sutra,6 which details magic ceremonies intended to remove the evil results of the violation of certain taboos. One of these is the primitive dread of disturbing

the earth, for which a natural explanation can be found in the deadly character of the work of commencing agricultural operations in a tropical climate : the earth must be consoled for the wound on her by the operation of opening her body.1 An expiationis equally required for the eating of food which has been

buried in the ground : it takes the homoeopathic form of offering in the fire grains which have been so buried.2 In domestic life the sin of marrying before an elder brother must be expiated and two hymns are provided for this express purpose.8 Expiations are also provided against Agni as Kravyad, the term which applies to the fire by which the body of the dead is burned, butwhich denotes also a definite aspect of Agni which he may assume without the actual contact with the dead.4 But the list of expiations is endless : there is hardly any sphere in which errors cannot be committed and expiations required, and the Brahman is the author par excellence of these rites.

CHAPTER 21   

THE DOMESTIC RITUAL 

1. The General Character ofthe Domestic Sacrifices THE householder of the Vedic period was expected to maintain a fire normally in his dwelling, sometimes, however, in a special place outside the actual house. The establishment of such a fire was normal on marriage, onthe division of the propertyof a family, the return of a student from his studentship, or the death of the head of the family, when his eldest son wasexpected to kindle a new fire. The fire might be produced by friction, butnormally it was obtained from the house of a wealthy man, or from one whomade many sacrifices. It was the duty of the householder, his son, wife, daughter, or pupilto keep it alive : if it was allowed to go out, it had to be rekindled by friction or reborrowed. If its existence had been interrupted for twelve days, a completely new establishment was prescribed. From it ongoing a journey the householder took leave and greetedit on his return, kissing his eldest son thereafter to the accompaniment of formulae, while daughters were kissed on the head, not the lips, in silence. 

The sacrifices of the domestic ritual were expectedto be performednormally by the householder ; his wife, however, might act for him as at the morning and evening libations, and at the evening Bali :l a Brahman mightbe used in nearly every case, though at the Paka offerings and one or twoothers the householder was requiredto act himself, according to someauthorities at least ; a Brahman was required for the offerings to Dhanvan tari and the spit-ox offering.2 If the householder wished to perform the function of the Brahman, he placed a sunshade and a garment, or straw puppet, on the seat in the south which a Brahman would occupy,if employed. The Brahmans claimed that at a marriage the formulae for the bridegroom must be said by them unless he were a Brahman himself, evidently an effort to extend their field of employment.3 The sacrificer wore a thread under the left armpit and over the right shoulder at offerings to the Fathers, but in the reverse way for offerings to the gods.4 

The divisions of the domestic offerings are very differently and confusingly given by the different authorities :6clearly the matter was not one of

agreement : one divisionIdistinguishes seven species of Paka offerings, where Paka probablydenotes cooked food, another2distinguishes what is offered in fire, what is exposed merely, offerings to the Manes, and offerings which are given to a Brahman to eat. The material included milk, barley 

gruel, porridge, curds, melted butter, rice, barley, sesame, and, but very rarely, animal victims. The butter offering various kinds of butter3are distinguished is of a fairly simple character : a ladle called Darvi, or a Sruva, is used ; also blades of grassfor purifying purposes, water to cleanse the grass blades, and kindling sticks, while enclosing sticks are laid around the 

fire. The Paka offerings*differ from the rauta in having no fore- or after offerings, no invocation of the Ida, and no kindling verses or instruction formulae, known as Nigadas. At the end of some at least of the rites, a cere mony called the Yajftavastuis performed: of the grass of the sacrifice a handful is taken, dippedin the butter, with a requestto the birds to lick it, sprinkled in water, and offered to Rudra as lord of the beasts.6 

The animal victim is prescribedfor a guest reception,for offerings to the Fathers, and at marriage: there is also a special spit-ox offering. The cow is the normal victim, but a goat is allowed to take its place. The ceremony of the offering was clearly akin to that of the frauta ritual ; there is the sametouching of the victim, the setting up of a famitra fire, which is derived fromthe fire-brand thrice carried round it, the taking out first of the omentum andits separate offering, and the cutting of pieces of ilesh. The feast was in effect an opportunity,doubtless readily appreciated,for a meal of flesh.6 

2. The Various Offerings 

The daily offerings of the householder include offerings at night andmorning to Agni and Prajapati, and Surya and Prajapati respectively:7 there is, however, great divergenceas to the nature of the offerings, usually rice or barley, and the exact deities and times of offering. Further, there are five great 

offerings to be performed ;8 the first is the Devayajna, that for the gods madein the fire morning and evening, when the meal is ready. The second, that called Bhutayaj fia or Bali,9 is offered on the ground for all manner of beings ; in the version of Gobhila, the first is for earth, the second for Vayu, the third for the All-gods, the fourth for Prajapati, then the fifth is offered in the water holder for the god of the waters, the sixth at the middle postsfor plants andi GS. i. 1. 15. i. 2, where great stress is laid on the use 1 GS. i. 5. 1. of a ram or goatin lieu, or flesh of a 3 AB. i. 3. 5, with comm. ; Macdonell and wild beast, and in default only is cereal Keith, Vedic Index, i. 250, 437 ; ii. 20. allowed.

trees, and the seventh at the house-door for the ether ; an eighth in the bed for Kama, and finally one in the dustbin for the Raksases. But many other names are also given, including offerings to hosts of serpents. The third great offering, the Pitryajiia,is the throwing of the rest of the Bali sprinkled with water to the Fathers. The fourth, the Brahmayajfta, is the repetition of some part of the Veda, usually reduced within narrow limits, and the 

fifth, the Manusyayajfta,is the feedingof Brahmans, guests, and beggars. In the version of ^ankhayana,1 Vai^vadeva offerings are made in the fire evening and morning to Agni, Soma, Indra and Agni, Visnu, BharadvajaDhanvantari, Vi9ve Devas, Prajapati, Aditi, Anumati, and Agni Svistakrt. Then come the actual Balis offered, in the centre of the floor for the samedeities, followed by Balis for Brahman and the Brahmans and Vastospati. Balis are then distributed through the different quartersof the horizon in dueorder to the presiding deities, Indra, Yama, Varuna, Soma, and Brhaspati, each with those connected with him. Then turning towards the disk of the sun offerings are made to Aditi and the Adityas, the Naksatras, seasons, months, half-months, days and nights, and years. On the thresholds offerings are madeto Ptisan as maker of ways, Dhatr, Vidhatr, and the Maruts ; on the grind stone to Visnu, on the mortar to the tree ;in the place where the herbs are kept to the herbs ; near the water-potto Parjanya and the waters ; at the head and the foot of the bed respectively to r! and Bhadrakall ; in the privy to Sarvannabhuti ; in the air in the eveningto the night-walkers, in the morning to the day-walkers ;in the north to the unknown gods andDhanapati, the lord of wealth. Finally the remnants are poured out in the south for the Fathers, and then a Brahman or student and women are formally fed, as well as boys and the old. In this version we have a duplication whichshows the fire ritual encroaching on the ordinary Bali ritual, which involves merely the placing on the ground of the offeringfor the use of the divinities. There is no doubt of the substantial antiquityof the latter rite, which is attested for Iran by the express and clear assertions of Herodotos,2 and has also parallels in the usage of the Slavs, Lithuanians, and Germans.3 It is further clear from ankhayana that we have in this elaborate rite the develop ment of something far more simple and primitive, the purpose of which is hinted at in the further directions which are given that one should eat nothing without having cut off and offered a portionthereof as a Bali, nor should one eat alone or before others. Not merely the eatingof firstfruits is a dangerous thing, rendering a preliminary offering to the gods and the Fathers desirable to break any taboo, but in every case of a meal it is well to propitiate bysharing the food which is enjoyed.4 Hence faiikhayana recommends, though

not as part of the formal rite, the giving of food to the dogs, the dog-butchers, and the birds, and Manu l formally includes in the Bhutayajfta dogs, outcastes, diseased persons, birds, and insects. In the Kaufika Sutra2 we find abstract deities, Dharma, Adharma, hope, faith, wisdom, prosperity, modesty, and

knowledge, along with the Vedic gods and snake deities such as VSsuki, Citrasena, Citraratha, Taksa, and Upataksa. 

In this generosity we may take it gods, Fathers, and men shared with all mannerof beings, and the term Bali appliedto all the offerings. Bhutayaj namay well have been a synonym, whence first were differentiated by regardto the recipients of the offerings the Fathers and men, Pitryajiia and Manus yayajfia. All these offerings were precisely of the same kind, made in the same way, without the use of fire, but the domestic ritual suffered expansion by the priests3through the introduction of the fire ritual, and we have the spectacle of the Devayajfta introduced making up with the Brahmayajfta, Vedic study,4 a set of five sacrifices. The Devayajfta,it is plain,is later than the Bhutayajria in this connexion, and this renders the effort5 to interpret Bhuta in the light of the existence of the Devayajfia out of the question.It is significant of its later character that the deities of the Devayajfta differ greatly and are largely priestly ; thus Gobhila6 make them to be the late figure of Prajapati and the technical one of Agni Svistakrt, who is far removedfrom popular rites. The absence of fire is found also, as we have seen, in parts of the frauta ritual, as in the hanging of offerings for Rudra on trees, a usage familiar from Germanic ritual, and it is common in the ritual of offer ings to the dead which are frequently placedin pits. 

The new and full moon offerings7 of the domestic ritual agree closely in the deity and other details with those of the frauta, but for cakes are substituted paps as offerings, and the offerings to Indra or Mahendra entirely disappear. Other deities are, however, sometimes substituted. At the end the wife of the sacrificer makes an offering to the man, the woman, the age or the bird, the white, the black toothed, the lord of bad women and others, who are difficult 

fully to explain. The sacrificer and his wife should spend the nightbefore the offering in telling each other stories, and the sacrificer should follow someat least of the other rules applicable to the sacrificer with the rauta ritual. A spring festival in the month Caitra8 is recorded by one Sutra only, figures of

pairs of beasts are made from meal, which suggest a vegetation magic as at the Vanmapraghasas of the rauta ritual 

At the month fravajia,1 when the rains begin and snakes become very dangerous, an offeringis made to appease them in the southern fire by the keeper of the fires, in the house fire by the ordinary householder, or a fresh fire may be lighted. In that offerings are made to many deities, including the earth spirit, Bhauma, the rains, ravapa, as well as Agni, Siirya, Vayu and Visrju ; fveta, a genius which is with its foot to drive away the snakes is also invoked. The second part of the sacrifice is one addressed directly to the snakes, who are given water to wash themselves in, a comb to comb themselves with, unguents, and so forth. Finally a Bali is offered to the snakes of the three regions: it is made of groatsor roasted barley. This performance goes on daily, until the time when the beds of the sacrificer and his wife, which have been raised upsince the beginning of the rains, are replaced on the ground with the advent of drier weather. A stream of water is poured round the house to keep the snakes at the desired distance from it. 

On the full moon of Praus^hapada2 an offeringis prescribed by one Sutra for Indra, IndranI, the one-footed goat, the serpentof the deep, and the Prausthapadas, and a Bali at the end to the Maruts, the other receiving butter libations. The mention of the two rare deities is clearly due to the presenceof the twin Naksatra, Prausthapadas. 

On the full moon of Ayvini3 is prescribed an offering to Payupati, iva, ankara, and Prsataka ; it consists of the sacrifice of a mixture of milk with butter. The deities, however, differ greatly, and it is not clear that the ceremony is intended for the welfare of the herds. The priest and the sacrificer partake of the Prsataka, and put on amulets, and later the cows are allowed to have a share of it, and eventually the calves and the cows are shut in together. The Agrahayani festival4is celebrated at the full-moon day of the monthMargajirsa : it is, as the name denotes, the festival of the beginningof a newyear, and is characterized by a thorough cleaning of the house, followed bya smoking of it parallel to German rites observed at the new year,in whichthe house is smoked. The offerer also pours water into a water-jug set on a firm stone, which constitutes the consecration of the water-holder, in which daily Balis are offered. The use of six or nine kinds of plantsin this ceremonyis paralleled by the use of nine in Germany. At this time, the danger from snakes being over, the beds come back to the ground : the ceremony is

carried out in due form, the householder sitting on a strew west of the fire with the rest of the family beside him in order of age, and then his wife andchildren, and those of the other members of the family : the earth is entreated to be friendly to them all. The snakes also receive offerings. A special formof snake offering1 is commenced in Bhadrapada for one injured by a snake : a five-headed snake of wood or clayis made and revered for a whole year. 

Of the occasional offerings the most interestingis the Arghya,2 the paying of honour to special guests, namely the teacher, the priest, a Snataka, if hecome as a wooer or on the day when he completeshis studies by the bath, whence his name is derived, a connexion by marriage,or a friend. Only once a year apparently should the full ceremony be paid, but constantly to a priest invited to sacrifice. The gifts are six, one or two stools to sit on, water to wash the feet, Argha water, a portionof which is poured over the guest's hands, water to cleanse the mouth, the Madhuparka, a mixture of curds, honey and ghee, with or without water and barley groats. The guest mayeat all, or give a portionto a son or pupilor other person : the king merely accepts pro forma and gives them to his Purohita. Finally the cow is offered and slain, unless the guest politely declines the offer, when other flesh may be used in its place. The deityvaries in the cases of the different guests, Agni, Brhaspati, Indra and Agni, Prajapati, Indra and Mitra, being given as the appropriate gods, for obvious reasons in most cases. 

The directions as to the buildingof the house3 are numerous and com plicated. Of interest is the fact that the presenceof certain plants and certain trees on the chosen place, or in its vicinity,is forbidden : the A9vattha is 

connected with the Agvins and causes the danger from fire, Yama's Palaga danger of death, Varuna's Nyagrodha danger of fighting, and Prajapati's Udumbara bad eyes. The chosen placeis thrice surrounded by a thin stream of water. The food chamber should be where water runs away, the parlour 

looking north, but opinions vary : the door should be in the west : it is also desirable that the householder should be ensured privacy at his meal andritual. When the postsare driven into the earth, an Avaka plantis put in the hole to prevent fire. When the middle post is put in, Ku9a grass is strewn, water, rice, and barley are poured on it, and homage paid to the earth spirit. An anointed stone is also buried, to which a parallelexists in the burying of stones in Buddhist templesin Siam. When the house is complete, an offering is made to Vastospati, which is repeated yearly according to some authorities. Brahmans are fed, and expectedto wish good luck for the place. Even a black cow or a white goat may be offered : the former in its colour is similar to the black cock killed at the foundation of a new house in Greece.4 Ten Balis

are also offered to the quarters. Of human sacrifice there is no trace in the ritual, which is meant in special of ordinary houses : such a practiceis only recorded of the much more important Agnicayana. But there are traces of such a practice laterl in legends and in history, perhaps coming from a period when the simple buildings of Vedic India had been superseded by large buildings of stone, which, like the brick altars, were supposedto need special 

measures to make them secure. 

The new house is entered when complete formally by the householder with his eldest son and his wife : they carry with them food, and partakeof honeyand butter to secure prosperityin it. On leaving and returningto it formulae of good luck are said.2 

Other acts of consecration are those of a grove or a tank of water : the offerings in the latter case include one to Varuna, as god of the waters.8 The agriculturalfestivals are not unimportant, and are numerous. Formulae are regularly used for the driving out and the return to their stalls of the cattle.4 Many curious performances5 are recorded as devices to secure the multiplying of the herds : the marking of a pairof calves male and female is one : in another a pap is offered to Agrii, Pusan, Indra and I$vara, andhonour is paid to the bull, whose neck and horns are ornamented and whois fed. In the case of a horse, Yama and Varuna are included in the offering, and the same respectis paidto the horse. A cow which has two calves should be given away. The spit-ox6 sacrifice brings wealth and is of a special character : an ox is offered in springor autumn to Rudra. The offeringis made away from the village after midnight,or at least after sunset : Rudra's twelve names are invoked. The omentum is offered with a leaf or a woodeninstrument, not with the Juhu ladle. Balis are offered also in all four quarters to appease the troopsof Rudra.7 The tail, skin, &c., are thrown into the fire, the blood is pouredout on Ku^a or Darbha grassfor the snakes, to whomformulae are addressed. None of the victims may be brought into the village, since the god is fain to hurt men, no connexion of the sacrificer may be near the place of sacrifice, and he himself shall not eat the flesh save for a very special instruction, in which case, however, he will prosper greatly. In another version of the offering, placeis found for the wives of Rudra, Rudram,Qarvaru, Bhavanl, and for Indrani : the blood-covered entrails are burned or cast into the fire. In another quitedifferent form8 the offerings take the place of three messes of rice, which are offered to three animals, a bull, a cow, and a calf, which are styled the fulagavaor Igana, the bountiful one, and the victor respectively: when the offerings are given, Rudra is hailed by all his 1 Haberlandt, ibid. 42 ff.* GGS. iii. 6 ; KhGS.iii, 1 ; HGS. i. 18.

names, the second offeringis made to the wife of Rudra, the third to Jayanta. The cows are placed round the fire so as to smell the burnt offering, and all go round it from left to right, while verses are addressed to the tilagava. It is perfectly clear * that here the bull and the cow are fetishes for the god and his wife, but the position of Jayanta is less obvious : possibly a child of the two is deemed to be represented by him. At the same time it must be realized that the beasts are so treated merely as a substitute for the other rite of slaughter ; the rite has every appearanceof being a later elaboration. 

Another rite,2 the Baucjhyavihara, a curious name of dubious origin, for the propitiation of Rudra and his hordes, is the making of a basket of Pala$a leaves, the placingin it of rice and butter, and hanging it on a tree as anoffering to the god as wearer of the quiver: the offerer also spreads leaves about and touches the cattle with a number of things, with sandal, salve, Sura, water, cow-dung, and a cow's tail to secure luck. Further, an offeringis made to Ksetrapati,3 who is represented by a bull as at the Qulagava rite. 

Mention is also made, as appropriateto be performed on the new moonafter full moon in Phalguna, of the marking of the cattle, which is accompaniedby the expression of the hope that the work will be more in the following year.4 The ceremony of letting loose a bull5is performed at the full moon of Karttika : it is performed by lighting a fire among the cows, offeringsix libations of butter and a pap for Pusan, and with a verse addressed to Rudra the bull is set free, after being ornamented. The Brahmans receive a meal for the pre paration of which milk from all the cows has been used. 

Of agricultural rites properthere are several of importance. The ceremonyof ploughing is formally accomplished after the ploughhas been yoked.8 On the east side of the field an offeringis made before the ploughto sky andearth. Among the deities to whom offerings are also made are Indra, Par janya, the Asvins, the Maruts, Udalakasyapa, Svatikarl, Sita and Anumati, and others : the bulls receive honey and butter. Other rites of the same kind are those to the furrow, the offering on the threshing-floor, at sowing,at harvest and at threshing, and here may be mentioned the offering made to avert danger from the moles or mice to the king of the moles or mice : asimilar practice may be the explanationof the connexion of the mouse with Apollo in which totemism has been so often seen.7 

The offering to the furrow is described at some lengthin one Sutra.8 1 Haradatta's effort to ignorethis is quite also AV. vi. 141 ; Delbruck, Guru indefensible, pujakaumudl, p. 48.

East or north of the field on a place which is pure, and has been ploughed without injury to fruits, or in the village, a fire is kindled, and Darbha grass mixed with rice or barley, according to the season, is strewed round it : then offerings of butter are made to Indra, Slta, the furrow, and Urvara, the ploughfield, and from the food cooked in a potto Slta, Yaja, the personified sacrifice, ama, 'energy', and Bhuti, 'prosperity'. On the Ku$a grass remaining from the strewing an offeringis made to the guardiansof the furrow, who sit in the east with bows and quivers,in the south to those with mail, in the west to the mighty Bhuti, Bhumi, Parsni, and unamkuri, and in the 

north to the terrible ones. The women should also make offerings. In a period lying outside the Vedic period proper we are carried by the Caitya offering which is recorded in one Sutra i1 it is interesting, as it seems clearly to refer to the offering of homage to the memorials erected to the memory of some teacher or other distinguished personage. The procedurecon templates that the Caitya cannot be visited in person: therefore the sacriftcer prepares two bales of food, and gives them to a messenger real or symbolical, to take to the destination, providingthe messenger with a weapon and boat, if the journey is a long one. The offering to Dhanvantari, which is mentioned with emphasis as needing the co-operationof priests,is not explainedin the texts. 

The offerings of firstfruits belongto the domestic as well as to the Qrauta ritual ; as in it there are offerings of rice, barley, and millet at different periods, and at these offerings Indra, Brahman, and Vasuki are to receive libations. Another similar offeringis the Asasyabali,to be performed by the householder alone, of barley up to the rice harvest, and of rice up to the barley harvest.2 

3. Birth Ceremonies and others 

As is natural the domestic ritual devotes much space to the minute descrip tion of large number of rites, mainly magical in essence, which accompanythe child from even before birth to its death. In the third or fourth monthor even later after pregnancytakes place the rite for quickening a male child, 

Puriisavana,3 the essence of which consists in the placingin the nostril of the wife by her husband of a Nyagrodha shoot, which he purchasesin due form andwhich is pounded, either by a young girl, or a student or a wife who is keeping a vow, or a Brahmabandhu, a term which is perhapsbest taken as a Brahman

by birth only, not by learning. A further rite is that to prevent an abortion, or more generally to secure the safety of the embryo, which is accomplished byoffering a cooked mess, and rubbing butter on the limbs of the wife.1 The cere mony of the partingof the hair2 is performedonce only for the first pregnancy, and is not repeated: it is celebrated in the fourth month or later. The wife sits west of the fire, her husband puts round her neck an Udumbara branchwith an even number of unripe fruits, he parts her hair from the front back wards with Darbha grass,3 Vlratara (* very male ') wood, a full spindle, and a porcupine's quill ; he also makes her look at the mess of rice, sesame, and ghee, and asks her to see in it offspring. Some authorities allow two lute players to sing the king, or him that is higher than the king, that is Soma. One special Gatha is prescribed which should end with the name of the stream on whichthe people dwell, and one or two such verses have been preserved to us. Otherauthorities providefor Brahman women sitting beside her, and uttering phrases indicating that she is to be the mother of living children. Old Brah man women are said also to be the authorities for the acts to be done in these cases. The wife should keep silence after the rite until the stars appear, whenshe should touch a calf, say the Vyahrtis, Bhuh, Bhuvah, Svar, and then speak. There are also ceremonies for the actual birth : the placeis anointed against the Raksases : a Brahman loosens all the knots in the house, as in Germany all doors and locks are opened ; water and the Turyanti plant are placed before the mother.4 If the child dies in birth, specialrites are ordered. When the child is born alive, a fire5 is lit in the house to warm utensils andbe used for the smoking of the child,6 which is performed by throwing into the fire grains of corn and hemp, with formulae to drive away demons of various kinds. For ten days the offering of sesame and rice grains is prescribed. On the twelfth day the specialfire disappears, the old household fire comes out into use, the purification of the wife and child having been performed. 

Immediately on birth are performed the ceremonies for securing long life, the Ayusya, and the productionof intellect, Medhajanana : in the case of girls these ceremonies may be performed, but then without the accompanyingformulae. The father breathes thrice upon the new-born child, and givesit to eat a mixture of butter, honey, and sour milk, to which others add rice andbarley, and even whitish black and red hairs of a black bull. The child is fed with a golden instrument. In some authorities five Brahmans are expected to invoke its possession of the breaths of life, or the father makes up for this

by going about the child in the several quarters. The child is asked to become a stone and an axe, and in some cases these instruments are actually present at the rite. At this point the smoking of the child may take place. Intellect is given by repeating a prayer in the ear of the babe, asking Savitr or Mitra and Varuna to giveit intelligence: with the fourth gold-covered finger butter and honey are given to the infant to eat. Thereafter the navel string is cut, and the child is washed and given the breast. After that a water jug is placed on the head of the mother, and she is commended to the protection of the water.1 

The child has two names,2 one secret for the knowledge of father andmother alone, and apparently given immediately on birth at the life-giving ceremony. This name from its close connexion with the life of the child is not allowed to be known in order to prevent injury through the use of the nameby enemies. The second normal name is given on the tenth day in agreementwith the Brahmans, or on the twelfth or even a year later. It should be of an even number of syllables, different merits being connected with the diverse numbers, begin with a soft letter, contain a semi-vowel, and end in s or a long vowel ; for a Brahman it should be a compound3 in Barman,'protection ', for a Ksatriya in varman,*armour ', and for a Vaigya in gupta,*protected '. A girl's name should have an uneven number of syllables. The givingof the name is accompanied by offerings to Prajapati, the day of birth, the Naksatraof that day, and the god of the Naksatra. Another name is the Naksatra namederived from a lunar mansion such as Rauhina : the notices regarding it are confused with that of the name by which the boy is to designate himself whenhe becomes a student and announces his name in greeting others, and one or both of these names seem to be made out to be the secret name. A Somasacrificer may have yet another name in due course. Birthday offerings to Agni, Indra, heaven and earth, the All-gods, the day and constellation of birth, and the deities of both, are prescribed every year. 

On the tenth or twelfth day after birth the father and mother and the child are washed, the house purified, and offerings made to the day of birth andthree constellations, to Agni and Soma. The specialfire is now extinguished, and the old household fire resumes its functions. The child is now named andenters thus into the full life of every day, just as in the Salic law, at the end of nine days,4it received its name and became a subject of wergeld.

On the third day of the third month the moon is revered by the father, andthe mother is newly washed, the child being first handed by the mother to the father and then given back to her by him. In the fourth month the first going out takes place, when the child is made to look at the sun. In the sixth monththe first solid food is given: its kind is dependent on what qualities are desired, quickness is due to fish eating, holy brilliance to the partridge, glory to rice and butter, oratory to Bharadvajl flesh, and so on.1 By one Sutra anoffering to speech and strengthis prescribed. 

The ceremony of the tonsure2 is usually performedin the third year, or the fifth and seventh for a Ksatriya and a Vai^ya respectively: the essence of the ceremony is the formal wetting of the child's hair, the puttingof bunches of Darbha on it, the cutting of the right and then the back and then the left side with a razor, which is not to injure the child, and which is addressed as an axe. The hair with the Darbha is thrown away in the cow-stall, near water, or in a pool of water or elsewhere. For three days after, the barber, it seems, must

not use the razor : as often, in the case of girls the formulae used for boysare omitted. The hair is then arrangedin the peculiar mode of the family, or in a number of tufts according to the number of seers hailed as belonging to the family tree in the Pravara ceremony. The barber receives as his fee rice and butter, or another gift: the family teacher a cow. In the sixteenth year, or the 22nd and 24th for the Ksatriya and Vai^ya, follows the shaving of the beard based on the same model, but the cuttingis extended to hair, beard, hair of the body, and nails. The fee to the priestis a pair of cattle, to the barber a goat. The shorn youth should for a year, or at least three days, observe chastity, and not cut his hair again.3 The piercing of the cars in the third or fourth year is a rite which is only recorded in one late text.4 

4. Studentship 

A Brahman child in the eighth year from conceptionor birth, a Ksatriya in the eleventh, a Vai^ya in the twelfth, should be received as a student by a teacher :5 the period can be increased to 16, 22, and 24 years respectively, but after that a youth has lost the right to say the Savitri verse, and should not be associated with, taken as a pupil, permittedto sacrifice, or acceptedas a son 

in-law : if the Savitri is lost for three generations, the right of the sacraments is lost, and can only be regained by the performance of the rauta rite called the Vratya Stomas. The ceremony of the receptionis performed with muchform before a fire newly lighted by friction or taken from the household fire : north of it are laid the necessary utensils, a stone, a fresh garment, a skin, ' ACS. i. 16 ; ?GS. j. 27.

a girdle, a staff, and twenty-one pieces of wood. The Sutras give innumerabledetails of the garments,the skin, and the staff : the materials and colour differ for each caste : thus the skin is of a black antelope for a Brahman,of a Ruru deer for a Ksatriya, of a goat or of a sheep for a Vai9ya, their girdles of Munja, of a bowstring, or wool, and so on, but the differences are endless ; the garment should be woven on that day. The teacher makes the pupil stand on the stone to secure firmness, he puts on his new garment and girdle and the sacred cord, and then the skin ; the boy is fed and a water libation offered.1 Then comes the formal taking of the student as a pupil by the teacher, effected by a dialogueof request and acceptance under the auspicesof Savitr, and with reference to the seer ancestry of teacher and pupil. Theyboth wash. Then follow rites to bring the two into close contact : the teacher takes the pupil by the shoulders and grasps his right hand with suitable formulae, and says to him,' On the instigation of Savitr, be the pupil of Brhaspati : taste water, lay wood on the fire, do thy work, sleep not byday '. Then the teacher touches the pupil's heart with a magic formula to unite their hearts, touches his navel, then whispers formulae in his ear and prays for wisdom for the child : finally he commends him to the care of gods and demons, or gods only. 

The teacher may then or later teach the pupil the Savitrl : the two sit opposite to each other, the pupil takes the teacher's right foot or both feet in his right hand, and begs to be taught the verse : the teacher repeatsit byquarter, by half verses, and then as a whole. Different verses are prescribed for the different classes. The pupil then puts kindling wood on the fire for the first time, and the staff is now usually given, after which the teacher receives a gift which may be whatever the pupil can afford, and the pupil pays reverence to the sun. For three days the fire continues to burn, the pupil must eat no salt or spicedfood. At the end of three days the Brahmans are fed, and bestow benedictions. 

The first duty of the pupilis to secure wood from the forest, without destroying living trees, for the fire which he tends morning and night : someauthorities requirealso that he should with prayers revere the morning andevening twilights in the woods, wearing the sacred cord and performing the usual ablutions. The making of sectarian marks on the body with ashes fromthe fire is not recognizedin any save an interpolated text.2 In the second place, he must beg food for his teacher and himself, in the first instance fromhis mother or other friends: twice a day this is done, and two meals, one after the first expedition and one after sunset, are prescribed. Thirdly, he mustsleep on the ground, and he is also enjoined to eat no spicedor salt food, to avoid resorting to women, not to sit on a high seat, &c. He is, fourthly, to be obedient to his teacher, to rise when he is spoken to, and answer at once. The mode of study was simple : the two sat down north of the fire, the

teacher as usual facing east, the pupil west, and the teacher at the requestof the pupil recited the verse he was to learn, giving the seer, deity, and metre of each : in the case of the Rigveda the pupil might learn all the hymns of each seer, or of each of the eighty-five Anuvakas, or so much as the teacher wished to teach him, or the first and last hymns of each seer or Anuvaka, or a verse at the beginning of each hymn. Doubtless there were differences in the extent of the teaching, accordingto the desire of the pupil and his caste : explanations 

of the texts and of the rites which they were to accompany must clearly havebeen given. At the end of each lesson Ku9a grassballs were taken by the 

teacher, a pit of cow dung made at their roots, and water poured on. Amistake on the partof the pupil requiredfor atonement a twenty-four hours' fast at least. 

During his period of studentship the pupil may have several vowsl to perform, each of which requires an initiation ceremony, and at the end the removal of the initiation. They are the ukriya vow, which precedes the study of the Rigveda, the akvara before that of the Mahanamni verses, the Vratika before the Mahavrata, and the Aupanisada before the Upanisads. The

first may last from three days to a year, the last three each a year. The last three cannot be undertaken until the Rigveda has been completelystudied : they contain the secret texts. For them a preparationis necessary of three 

days or a night only : the teacher envelopes the head of the pupilin a garment,2 and bids him, while ceasing to observe the rule of laying wood on the fire, begging, &c., to spend the time in a wood, or temple,2 or place where the Agni hotra is offered : the teacher himself abstains from flesh and sexual inter course, and then at the end of the period of probationinstructs him in the forest in the secret texts, the pupil wearing a turban : in the case of the Mahanamniverses the instruction is as usual ; in the other cases the pupillistens only. He gives the teacher as fees a turban, a vessel, and a cow. Other vows are prescribed for learners of the Jyestha Saman, who must not eat bird flesh, and must avoid contact with udra women. The akvarl vow must have been popular, as a mother is representedas wishingfor her infant that he mayperform it. The three verses of the Stotra which make up the Saman are revealed at the end of the three portions of the vow. The pupil must fast, andshut his eyes to receive them, a clear reference to their dazzling power. 

The beginningof each term of study is marked by a festival under the Naksatra Hasta or ravana, but there are traces of different openingsof the year ; roughly the rainy season may be said to have been the popular time, when other forms of activity were hampered. The ceremony was performed

by means of offerings of grains with ghee and milk, and with the repetition of either the whole of the Rigveda or the first verses of sections and manyofferings : the deities vary from each Veda, and it is only of interest to note that they include abstractions such as Medha, 'intelligence', Dharana,*fixing in memory', fraddha, Anumati, 'favour*, and Sadasaspati and other deities : the divisions of the texts were sometimes ascribed to deities, and the seers are duly honoured. The ceremony was followed by three days' break of study, andsimilarly a break occurred at the end : breaks are also prescribedafter the Astakas, when offerings were made to the Fathers, and on many other days, full- or new-moon days, while deaths and other things such as raddhas, the sight of unholy persons, dogs, asses, or jackals, the noise of a Saman, the cries in distress of men and so forth, prevent learning ; the aim of the Sutras seems to have been to interrupt study as often as possible. Thunder, lightning, rain, earthquakes, meteors, and other prodigies more reasonably interrupt study.1 

The term comes to an end in Magha or Taisa, after from 5J to 6 or occasionally even only four months' duration : it is marked by the Utsarga,2 4 dismissal'festival, where offerings are made to gods, seers, &c., and a bath is taken by teacher and pupils, of whom the number to be taken by any one teacher is in no wise limited. After this an old rite of offering to the Fathers is described by Hirapyake^inin full detail. Even, however, after this Utsarga, which normally brought work to an end for the year, some might resume their studies and continue working throughoutthe year. The total length of the study might extend to forty-eight years, or twelve for each Veda, or such time as was necessary to learn each : clearly the matter was not in the slightest degree fixed. The end of the period of learningis marked by the final bath,8 which is best taken when the student has completed his instruction and performed all his vows, but may be taken if either is complete. With the bath, the exact time for which is variously stated, are combined shaving, hair cutting, nail paring, and teeth washing. The hair is thrown away in a cowstall, beside an Udumbara or Darbha grass. The whole of the pupil'soutfit is cast into the water, and the Snataka,*one who has bathed ', puts on a newsuit, shoes, sunshade, staff, garland, powder, salve for hands and lips, eye-salve and turban, and the teacher does likewise ; or the teacher alone can adopt this gay clothing. The student has also ear-rings and a mirror. All day he must keep from the sunlight and remain silent till the stars appear: then he goes east or north, pays reverence to the quarters, and to the stars and the moon, converses with his friends and goes to where he expectsto receive the Argha gift, which is appropriatefor a Snataka immediately after the bath. For the first days after his completionof his study, he should eat no flesh, not

mode of livelihood is the worst.2 He is also forbidden to look in a well, andmany other taboos are imposed on him ; on the other hand he is also not to speak of what he has not seen or heard as if he had, to avoid whatever hinders study, and to guard himself like a vessel of oil.8 Curious is the rule that he is to avoid mentioning undesirable things, which are more or less taboo to him, by their own pames ; a pregnant woman he is to call' without children' a Nakula,fc ichneumon % Sakula ; a Kapala,c skull ', Bhagala ; and so on.4 

5. Marriage 

The duty of the Vedic Indian to marry is assumed by all the texts, and the domestic ritual gives preciserules for the performanceof the legitimate andhonourable form of marriage,6ignoringas a rule the irregular forms based uponcapture, violence, or mere mutual love without parental approval, which are recognized by the law books in various forms, Gandharva, Asura, Pai$aca, andRaksasa, as well as the romantic form of nominal self-choice by the bride of a suitor, the Svayamvara which bears traces of a test of skill of suitors by the king or other parentof high rank similar to that of Kleisthenes. The youthshould obtain permission from his parentsor his teacher to marry : only oneSutra 6prescribes the numbers of brides, three for the Brahman, two for the Ksatriya, and one for the Vai^ya, and in one view a udra for each : this refers clearly to a rule by which each caste could have a wife of its own and one of each inferior caste* The later texts prescribe that the maiden must be of the same caste and land, but not of the same Gotra as the father or a sapindd on the mother's side, rules which are difficult to define with precision.7 Maidens with names of stars, rivers, or trees are to be avoided, as are those with names with r or / as the penultimateconsonant. The physical marks are most important, but, as it is difficult to be sure of them, the maiden may be given eight or nine lumpsof earth chosen from different places, and, as she choses, her disposition can be gauged.8 The bridegroom should be of goodfamily and character, have good bodily signs, be healthy and learned. As con siderations in marriage family ranks above intelligence, beauty, and wealth.9

The first formal stepin the procedure, which doubtless was often carried out only after the marriage had been duly arranged beforehand by the parents with the advice oi the Brahmans, was for the bridegroom to send wooers, usually his own father and the Acarya of the house, to the father of the other family : the new-comers announced themselves, and set out the Gotra names

doubtless to show that the relationship was not a forbidden one and if the other side agreed,all touched a pot filled with grains, fruits, flowers, &c., pronounced a formulae expressing agreement and assurance, and then the teacher of the bride's family placed the pot on her head. When the girlis to betaken to her new home, she is first formally washed by women of the samecaste, and she names her husband in a verse addressed to Kama,fc love '. Sheputs on a red or uncoloured garment and sits behind the fire, and holds on to the priest as he offers to Indra and Indran! : the bridegroom offers similarly to Vai$ravana* and Ifana. Thereafter four or eight women dance in the house of the bride, and receive food, and the Brahmans are also fed. The appropriate time for the wedding ceremony is the northern course of the sun and the increas ing half of the month, but some authorities allow any time almost to be used : the two months of the cool season and the last hot month are by some excluded. The bridegroom is led to the house of the bride by gay young women, not widows, to whom he must behave with complaisance. On his arrival, heshould, according to some authorities, be received with the Argha offering of acow, but by others this is postponed until the actual consummation of the marriage : a second cow is also later slain in the bridegroom's own house in honour of his father, teacher, and others. The bridegroom, with the permission of the maidens, gives the bride a new garment, anoints her, putsin her right hand a porcupine quill, perhaps for the ceremony of hair-parting, which takes place after pregnancy, and in the left a mirror. Her relatives then put on her a reddish black cord of wool or hemp with three amulets, and place Madhukaflowers on the bridegroom* 

Other preparations have been made for the wedding. A fire is lit outside the house, water is procured by Brahmans, roast grains and a stone are in readiness. The maiden is formally handed over by the father to the bride groom, but the place of this rite, the Kanyapradana, differs in the various authorities. The bride and bridegroom sit down on a mat behind the fire, andthen butter oblations are offered, and also an oblation by the father or brother of the bride on the head of the bride, with a sword pointor a ladle, in order to secure her pre-eminencein the house of her stepfather. Then comes the pouring into the joined hands of the bride of grains by her brother or mother ; she is made to stand on a stone, when she receives the grains, and her husbandinvokes her to be firm as the stone : she offers the grains and her husbandleads her round the fire, keeping her right side turned to it : this is all donethrice, the offerings being to Varuna, Aryaman, and Pusan respectively.

Then the bride takes seven stepsin the north-east direction, the quarter of victory, the bridegroomtakes her by the shoulders, and touches heart andnavel as at the ceremony of the initiation of a student, and water is sprinkled on her. Then the bridegroom,in the version of Gobhila, takes the hand of the bride as she sits facingeast and he stands facing west : this rite is placed differently by other authorities : the manner of seizing the hand depends onwhat is wished : if he desires sons only the thumb, if daughters the fingers,if both the whole hand. Then gifts are made : the Acarya receives a cow froma Brahman, a village from a royal personage, a horse from a Vaigya.If he has a daughter, he receives a hundred cows and a car, unless, as is much moreprobable, the provision really refers to the old practice of purchasing a wife.1 The bridal garmentis also givento the knower of the Surya hymn, which is used for the rites, and is apparently hung up on a post.2 The bride is nowtaken to her new home by a car, horse, or elephant, and formulae are pro vided for all eventualities, when she cries,3 when there is a breakdown en route, and so on. If they cross a stream, she is not to look at the crew. Fire is carried with them so that, if the car breaks, it can be mended, and then besprinkled with butter left over from the offering made. This fire serves also to be the fire used by the householder at the sacrifices which his marriage imposes upon him. Some authorities prescribe the spendingof the first night of marriage in the house of an old Brahman woman, whose husband andchildren are still alive, in which case the bride sits in silence on a red skin, hair upwards, until the stars appear: when this happensher husband offers six butter libations, poursthe remains over her head, and shows her the stars Arundhati and the polestar4 as symbols of constancy. When they arrive at the home of the husband, he unyokes first the right, then the left animal, andBrahman women, with living husbands and children, help her down. Shemust enter the house without touching the threshold, and sit down on a skin, hair up, but she may be lifted over it and so put down by a strong man. Onher lap a male child is placed,fruits are put in her hands, and Brahmans wish her prosperity. Then, if not before, the ceremony of looking at Arundhati and the pole star may take place. 

The marriage is not consummated for three nightsafter it : for that time the newly married couple must lie on the ground, avoid spicedor salted food, and, if they refrain from consummation for a year, the birth of a seer son is predicted for them. Between them in this periodat night a staff is placed which is clad in a garment : it is clear that it is a symbol of the Gandharva

Vi^vavasu, who is addressed when on the fourth nightit is cast away. Theexact force of the practiceis uncertain : the desire by refraining from con summation to deceive evil demons and cause them to departis a possible motive. Vi^vavasuas a Gandharva*seems to claim his rights of connexion with women even after the marriage, and must at first be appeased and then formally be banished.2 But the obvious connexion of the rite with other similar rites over the world down to the ius trium noctium is a warning against any feeling of securityin the interpretation of the customs, which are of immemorial antiquity and based on feelings which are perhapsto us nolonger psychologically even possible. The Vedic marriage does not contain any hint that by a previousrite of any sort the danger of interference with virginity8 was removed, and, therefore, the first three nights may have seemed a time of too great danger to allow of immediate consummation of the marriage. In that case there may have arisen the idea that the GandharvaVi9vavasu possessed these three nights, and the idea may be due to the rite, not a cause of it. 

The removal of the periodof continence is marked by an offeringin the fire to Agni, Vayu, Surya, Aryaman, Pusan, Varuna, and Prajapati, with Svistakrt as the eighth. To this list others add Candra and Gandharva.4 The root of the Adhyancja plantis pounded, and some of it placedin the nostrils of the wife at the time of the menses, as a rite to secure conception.5 Before andafter the first periodof intercourse, formulae must be recited at great length: they are clearly love spells to secure affection and offspring. On the fourth day of the marriage finds place a ceremony mentioned by one Sutra alone : the husband and wife have their hair and nails cut and then go out of the village to pay honour to an Udumbara tree, and to pray for good fortune ontheir marriage. Fish also are caught in a fresh cloth and offered as a Bali to the water birds.6 

The rite, which is of course paralleledin innumerable details by the prac tices of Greeks, Romans, Germans, and many other peoples Aryan and non Aryan, is on the whole but loosely connected with religion. The Vedic ritual prescribes many verses and offerings, but the great wedding hymn,7 which

makes the wedding of Surya, the sun maiden, and Soma, the mysterious godknown by the Brahmans, doubtless the moon, the prototypeof the humanwedding, is clearly a late production, and the outcome of much priestly elaboration. Agni alone is the real objectof much feeling, and it is as the living fire on the hearth that he is really worshipped.1 

As in the case of the wedding ceremony, it is easy to find parallels for manyof the rites of the Vedic domestic life, nor is it in the slightest degree doubtful that the formulae, which are used in the Vedic texts, were in the maininvented or transferred, very often very badly, from other rites for use with practices which came into being and developed without any assistance frompriestly influence. In many cases, of course, the formulae are merely redac tions of the actual words which often must have accompanied these rites in the first instance : in others, as in the wedding service, much new matter wasintroduced. But in these cases the essential pointof interest is rather the alteration by the Brahmans than the primitive rites, which are common to civilized Indians and much more savage tribes, and some of which persist among the highestcivilizations of the earth. The case of the initiation of the boys of the peopleis the most striking instance of the peculiar character given to a rite by the influence of the priests. It is clear that, already bythe period of Indo-Iranian unity, the ceremony has assumed a good deal of its present shape, and that a spirit of civilization had been introduced into barbaric rites. The conceptionof Vedic India saw in the initiation a species of second birth : by it the boy became fully a twice-born person, and failure to undergo initiation as we have seen might lead to inconvenient results for the person so failing. Certain taboos appliedto the youth, but most of them hadbeen reduced to reasonable limits, and could be supported by primitive ideas of what foods were suitable, as for example in the case of the interdiction of the use of flesh and honey for a growing boy who was in his studentship. Moreover, the relation of pupil and teacher has clearly been in some degree remodelled on the analogy of human marriage,in order to make it an expres sion of spiritual union. 

In other lands and among other peoples strange puberty or initiation rites have been recorded, many of them accompanied by violent physical tortures and applied both to boys and to girls, of which Sparta in historical times still preserved relics, and which are still practised widely among modernsavages. The idea of a second birth has often been connected in the mindsof the performersof these rites with the practices which they follow andcarried to the logical extreme of requiring the newly born people to start life at the infant stage,2 to pretend that they have forgotten how to speak,or to feed themselves. Severe scourgings, the knocking out of teeth, circum

cision, the pouringover the initiated of kindred blood and other agreeable absurdities are recorded of such tribes, and it is natural of course to see in the Vedic rite a deliberate and reasoning reduction of these practices to sensible limits. There must be a certain amount of truth in this, but it is essential to note that we have no evidence to what extent the more violent of these 

customs ever prevailed among the ancestors of the Indo-Europeans.1 Thecustoms in question agreein the main only in their infinite variety, and it would be impossibleto establish any form for initiation. In some cases doubt less the practices often were changed and assumed new forms : the drastic treatment of the Spartan boys may have been seriouslyintensified with adefinite view to discipline character, though the origin may have been merely the driving away of evil influences at a critical time of youth, the appearance of puberty : in the case of girls, the Vedic Indians, in accordance with their usual practice as regards women, ignored entirely their claim to be initiated, and therefore prescribed no form of ritual at all for them. 

The motive 2 for the doctrine of initiation is not alluded to in the Indian rite : beyond the obvious possibility of it being a mere expulsionof dangerous influences, and an effort by the fiction of a new birth to deceive the demons, there is no suggestionof much cogency. In the view of Sir J. Frazer the whole of these rites and the origin of totemism may be due to the wish to 

deposit permanentlyat a dangerous time of life the external soul in some safe object, but the suggestionlacks both external proof and internal cogency.3 Of the other domestic rites, that of the parting of the hair raises many pro blems. Various motives4 may be assigned: the alteration of the mode of wearing the hair at marriage is known among other peoples than the Vedic Indians.5 It is possible that it must be reckoned as a piece of deception magic, to deceive demons at a time when a woman is certainly exposed to muchdanger : possibly the idea may be to render more easy the entry of the child desired into the woman, if we ascribe to the period6 the doctrine that a child enters db extra.

CHAPTER 22   

MAGIC IN THE RITUAL 

1. The Relations of Magic to Religion 

THE theory that all religionis later than magic has already been discussed, and its fundamental weakness pointed out,1 and it is therefore possible to con sider the question of the relation of these two factors apart from any pre conceived doctrine of the priority of magic. The positionin the literature of Vedic India is a simple one : with very few exceptionsthe Rigveda is a bookin which magic is not dealt with : a few late hymns are indeed found there, but these stand out as exceptionsin a religious milieu. ^TheAtharvaveda is a book of magic, mingled with some theosophy : that it is priestly magic, andnot popular magic uninfluenced by the priestsis clear : the priests have con stantly altered, and changed much of what they dealt with, but the book itself is conclusive proofthat the priests of that time were keenly concerned with magic rites. The positionis further made clear by the Brahmanas, whichshow beyond possibility of doubt that the whole of the sacrifice was penetrated by conceptions of magic.x. Scarcely any rite but can be so adapted as to pro duce magic ends\the rites are often varied in detail for this very purpose, the mode in which the postis covered with the cord will determine the amountof rain which will fall, the priest can bringto nothing the kingdom if he varies by manipulations the offering ; he is constantly told how to alter the words, when he dislikes the sacrificer, or when he seeks to obtain for him such special blessings as a male child.}} 

The Atharvaveda and the Brahmanas prove, therefore, that the India of their period was one in which magic and religion were inextricably blended : the same conclusion is suggested by the Rigveda itself : the man who is pure complains that he is called a magician and a companion of evil spirits,2 anddoubtless many among the priests who composed the songs of the Rigvedawere not devoted to magic or specially interested in it. The exaltation whichsaw in the poetry of the Rigveda the highest form of honour which the gods could receive, would scarcely trouble itself about the lower field of magic. But we cannot believe3 that there was ever a time when the Vedic sacrifice was not filled with magic elements,4 and all that we can say with certainty is 

1 Cf. also Jevons, Idea of God (1910). the elements lie side by side in no 8 RV. vii. 104. 16. strongly felt differentiation. 8 Magic and sacrifice represent two different4 So the Babylonian and in less degree the

For Vedic magic,

that the desire to see magic in everything was one which was growingin the period of the Brahmanas, which degrade the sacrifice from the position of an appeal to the bounty of heaven to the position of the greatest power onearth, which controls the godsarid produces whatever is desired by the priests. Magic thus won a powerful support from theosophy, and we cannot in the Vedic literature say that magic was regarded as a wicked thing, except whenit was practised by others against a man. If he could, he would himself use magic to confound his enemies.1 The code of Manu2 in effect well sums upthe point of view of its own, and also of the earlier Vedic period,in the doctrine that, while witchcraft is a bad thing, the Brahman who is wronged need not seek redress tamely by civil process through the intervention of the royal authority, but should assert his own power by his magic arts. The positionis natural enough ; all religions have to contend with magic, and, while the higher religions cast much aside, they cannot be successful in removing all. The Vedic religion had, however, developed no such moral or religious basis as would render it possible to demand the disappearanceof magic rites, and thus magic flourished under its aegis in almost a disconcerting degree. Nothingshows how much the idea of the magic power of the sacrifice and its importance superseded moral considerations in the minds of the priests than the offerings prescribed by one text3 to enable a man to break faith at pleasure without punishment by Varuna. 

2. The Nature of Vedic Magic 

In the sphere of Vedic magic we have to do both with personal and with impersonal substances. The conceptionof all sorts of demons as threatening man is one which is supplemented by the more impersonal view of substances or potencies, which dwell in things, and which are often, therefore, of value in magic rites. It is possible that the earlier view is that which conceives these potencies either animatisticallyas actually alive, or animisticallyas spirits, 

but in the Vedic literature the two views, personal and impersonal,are bothclearly found, and, like everything in the Veda, theyare never clearly kept apart. Such powers4 are the powerof error in the sacrifice which clings to the sacrificial post, and therefore may pass to the sacrificers,5 if care is not taken to render it harmless, the nature in woman, which causes her to slay her husbandor to bear no children to him, and to bring death and disease among his cattle.6 

see V. Henry, La magie dans Vlnde* One term for these is tanu, body, e.g. antique, and Caland, Altindisches used of hunger and thirst in TA. iv. 22; Zauberritual ; Macdonell, ERE. viii, Oldenberg,Rel. des Veda*, p. 478. 811-21.

3 TS.ii. 2.6.2.Chap. 22] The Nature of Vedic Magic 381  

It is not vitally to be distinguished from the strengthof the_tigerj which is found in its hair and its skin, and which makes these things suited for use in many magic performances, by which man seeks to attain for himself strength 

and kingship over men, such as the tiger exercises over animals. The frog andthe Avaka plants can be used for cooling,for they have in them the nature of the water, a fact which shows clearly how real the presenceof the deityin a symbol was to the Vedic conception. The banished king uses a clod of earth from his home in his desire to regainhis kingdom : the lightning1 leaves its strength in the tree which it blasts, the boar in the earth which it kicks up :2 the name, the image,the hair, the very footprints3 of man, are so connected with him as to be suitable modes of injury. Hence we can understand such legends as the theory that in laughing Makha4 allowed his brilliance to depart from him, that the gods placed it in the plants, and thus was millet produced. Or again the white Valakhilyas5practisedasceticism : half of it with the resulting power Tarksya drank, and thus created the bird Garucla. The sameidea displays itself in the constant fear of being affected by the mouth, which is one of the motives, no doubt, of the fasting recommended often by the Veda ; of being affected by mere inhalation, whence often the holding of the breath is laid down ; or of being affected by sight, whence often the eyes must be shut, or the sacrificer must at least not look round. The constant play of fancy between the real substance and the spiritis seen in the treatment of such ideas as Papman,6impersonal evil, or the spirit of a thousand eyes, or of Takman, the actual fever disease,7 which seizes the patient, and makes himshiver, and the spirit which brings this about. 

Of the means, which we may describe as magic in opposition to the rule of petition and offering which is religion, much of course is based on actual observation of fact, and much is based on mistaken fancies : magic, indeed, is doubtless in some sense and in fact the forerunner of science,8 and like science is slow in clearing away misconceptions of all kinds. At times it is desirable to attract substances or spirits, at times urgently necessary to drive away such things : another branch of the subjectis divination, which rests on the samefoundation of contiguity or similarity, upon which rest the other laws of magic. PIC means arc various : the word is of great importance, and so again are figures or representationsof things which may be used as substitutes for or in addition to articles connected with the things or persons, who form the sub jects of the conjuration. The time againis of importance: many things should be done at night, but others at special times of the day or the year, and

various places are specially favourable, such as cross-roads, or graveyards, where spirits do mostly congregate, and where are the evil birds of prey andthe jackals. But in special circumstances almost any placeis suited specially for the rite. 

It is natural, that, representingas it does a partof the primitive science of man, magic should be found in similar forms all the world over. There is little that is of special character in Indian magic, and the varietyof its rites is enormous : fortunately or unfortunately for our opinion of the intelligence of the Vedic Indian not only has the Atharvaveda come down to us, but the Kauika Sutra contains (vii-lii) in the fullest detail, often however unintelli gible to us, the nature of the rites which were used with the texts of that Veda. Other details occur in the Pari^istas of the Atharvaveda, in the SamavidhanaBrahmana, in the Rgvidhana and minor texts. The antiquity of these works is by no means very great: the age of most of the practices may be indefinitely remote. The only practices of which we can say definitely that they are in novations are those, not at all few in number, in which priestly ingenuity has used mythical ideas, in order to found on them a magic practice. Thus in onerite laid down in the Kau^ika Sutral we find that as a means of driving away evil spirits the use of a food is prescribed, which has been cooked with wood of a tree in which birds nest : this is due merely to the fact that in accompanying verses Indra, the averter of evil spirits,is invited to comeas a bird to a tree. 

3. The Removal of Hostile Influences 

In a modified degree the principleis adopted in Vedic ritual that hostile powers should be propitiated. Thus the Raksases are giventhe portions that fall away from the grain, when it is pounded for the offerings: the blood, the entrails, the excrement of the animal victim, are made over to them or the snakes. Diseases treated as demons are propitiated and shown reverence in the hope, which is expressed, that they will depart, being satisfied with whatis done for them. The disease Takman is entreated to depart, and addressed as a god, just as amongthe Esths down to modern times the same procedure of paying homage was adopted to make a disease depart.8 What is moreinteresting is that both methods might be tried in close conjunction: the jackal might be addressed with formulae of reverence at the one time, and at the same time a fire brand be thrown at it.3 The ants receive an offering, but, if that fails, a poisonous mixture is made for them, and the aid of the gods in their utter extirpationis invoked.4 Snakes are simultaneously treated with reverence, and their extinction invoked : in the snake offering itself, while the snakes are fed, the sacrificer draws round the house a line of water to keep them away from it. But as a rule the attitude of the Vedic Indian to 1 xxix. 27. Based on AV. vi. 2. 2 ; Olden- 16. 24 ; HGS. ii. 7. 2 ; BDS. ii. I. 32. berg, Rel. des Veda*, p. 480, n. 3.8 HGS. i. 16. 20 ff.

the hostile powers is the desire to banish them far from his life, to deceive andcheat them in every way : hence such actions as fasting to forbid them en trance, refraining from breathing, from intercourse, from looking round and so on. The same idea is also to be seen in the fact that on certain occasions dis guises are adopted, and that the hair which is cut from the child or youth is carefully buried. In this last instance, however, in many cases the hair is prescribed to be buried in such a place as a cow stall, and in that instance it may be that the burying was rather to bring prosperity to the cowsl than as a piece of prophylactic magic, or the two ideas may have been merged into one. The difficulties of realizing the precise sense of magic rites is far greater than that of interpreting religious ceremonies. Other modes of avoidance are mentioned, in addition to not looking round at any dread sight, or not cominginto physical contact with what is dangerous : thus the mother is impure for ten or twelve days after birth and is avoided, and the bricks for Nirrti at the setting up of the fire altar are put in place without actual contact. Steps are taken to efface the footsteps of the priest, who carries the fire of the sacrifice, just as a clog is bound to the foot of the dead to wipe out the tracks. Similarly the use of different doors from the normal may be prescribed: the child attacked by the doggie demon cough is taken into the assembly hall, where the spell to exercise the demon is to be performed, through a hole made in the thatch.2 When the sacrificer dies, and the fire hitherto maintained by himbecomes the place of resort of powers of death, it is removed, butlnot by the door. Or, again, something may be interposed to shut out the demons : water they cannot cross,8 and the use of water prevents the evil influence of the bricks for Nirrti 4 or the funeral rite exercising its power. Similar cases of the inter position of obstacles are presented by the use of a stone to sever the living from the dead, the mat5employed for the same purpose, and at the sacrifice the enclosing sticks placed round the fire in order to keep off the demons. 

' The use of water for actual washing away different forms of evil is extremely common, as in the final bath : the place where a pigeon has alighted is washed clean : the bride is washed to rid her of all evil influences : after dealings with Rudra, demons, or the Fathers, it is necessary to purify oneself by touching water, but not rain water, which is deemed to have somedegree of impurity and to spoil offerings on which it falls. The face is wipedafter an evil dream.6 Lead and wool are used also for cleansing purposes.7 The urine of a cow has as in Iran and in modern India great propertiesof cleansing.8 The new-born child is washed, and also the breast of the mother : but smoke is also used to purify the child, while fire is a constant source of protection. The sickle with which is cut the grass for the sacrifice is madeglowing by means of fire, thus drivingoff the Raksases.

384 Vedic Ritual [Part Hi  

The use of noise to drive away demons is common : the drums at the Mahavrata rite are paralleled by the sounds made by the Soma stones at the pressing, which are made doubly resonant by the device of putting underthem sounding holes. The noise of the Saman is also powerful to drive awayevil, if the critics of the Saman singers also make it a ground for the breaking off of the holy study for the day on which it is heard. Pots are beaten at burial. When a gong is beaten, it is expected that the demon which has a child in its grip will be driven away.1 The fragrant bdellion also serves to drive away demons, while the Apamarga plant is famed for this service, which, as its name denotes, it derives from its power to wipe off the influences of such powers. The ritual use of beating is not unknown : it occurs during the royal consecration, when the priests gently beat the prince,2 and it may per haps be recognized in the beating of their thighs by the maidens who dance round the fire at the Mahavrata, bearing on their heads the water pitchers.3 

The use of a staff is of special interest : the student is given a staff, and is forbidden ever to let anything intervene between his body and it. Whenhis studentship is over, it is thrown in the water with the rest of his outfit, but he obtains a new staff, and this is expresslystated to be of use not merely for protection against human foes but also from Raksases and Pigacas.4 TheSoma offerer has a staff, which he receives from the priest to guard him, andwhich he ought never to let go.5 The Maitravaruna priest stands through the service with staff in hand, slightly bending forward, in the attitude of readiness to smite the demons. A specially consecrated staff brings fortune wherever one goes : if a circle is drawn with it and one thinks of a place, then no enemycan enter that place.7 The wooden sword of the sacrificer is used to cut upthe earth on the altar place, and it is thrown into the dust heap, being treated as the enemy, Araru, who is destroyed.8 After an offering to the Fathers the sword is drawn over the altar to send away the demons. Small staves are shot in the air at the wedding ceremony to destroy the sight of the Raksases. 

Yet another form is that of shaking : the black antelopeskin used at a sacrifice is shaken out with the view of removing any evil that may havecrept there : the corner of the garment of him who offers to the Fathers is similarly shaken to remove any evil spirit. Remains of Sura were thrown awayon an ant heap. Akin to these rites is the use of a comb to purify the hair of the bride from dangerous influences of any sort, and also the passing of people through narrow holes, of which the classical example is that of Apala in the Rigveda,9 whom Indra dragged through the hole of the chariot, of the cart,

Chap. 22] The Removal oj Hostile Influences 385and of the yoke, and so healed of a skin disease, and which is to be seen also in the marriage ritual, when the hole of the yoke of a car is placed on the bride.1 The aim of this rite is probablyalso to be seen in the making of a hole in the roof of the assembly hall for the introduction of the boy who is ill : the narrowness was probablya feature of the rite. The question which arises in this case, as in the case of the passingof an army under the yokein the Roman usage,2 is whether the guilt of blood or the disease is considered to be wiped away by the contact with the sides of the hole, or whether it is to be classed as one of the devices by which an enemy is deceived and the angry demons or spirits of the dead are baulked of their prey.   

In many other cases the planis adoptedof the transfer of the evil to someother person or thing. The principleis at work in the case of the scapegoat, of which the classic exampleis to be found at the final bath of the horse sacrifice. The bride's garmentafter marriage is hung up on a tree or post,, so that the evil influence in it may be disposedof. Similarly the cloth with which she is wiped is givento the guardianof the maiden, who putsit in a cow stall or hangs it up in the wood.8 The Vratyas at the end of the festival, bywhich they are admitted to the Brahmanical community, hand their apparel and utensils to other Vratyas,or an inferior Brahman of Magadha, who bears away the defects inherent in them. A cow which is unfit for a fee is given to an enemy. After a miscarriage the woman is taken to three different huts : she is made to stand on lead and washed, her dark garmentis taken off, and the hut burned.4 The sufferer from a headache goes out with a turban onand scatters grains: when an attack comes on, he deposits the turban, the winnowing fan which he has used, and a bowstring: apparentlythe demon is to come out of the head into the turban and to make for the grains, when he will be attacked by the bow.6 To avert a bad omen a hook is tied to the foot of a black bird, a cake attached, and it is sent away to hang on to the enemyas the hook hangs to it. Sleeplessnessis banished to Trita Aptya or to anenemy. An offeringis prescribed, by which it is possible to prevent twoenemies transferring to a third persontheir mutual hatred. For a person whois possessed of an evil spirit various devices are combined : fragrant substances are mixed together and burned, the person concerned stands against the water of a stream, and water is pouredover him, an offeringis hung up on a bird frequented tree, in each case to take away the evil.6 Fever is banished to the distant people of Gandhara and the Mujavants. A ceremony is prescribed bywhich when a man is thirstyin illness he transfers the thirst to another man.7 The disease jaundiceis transferred to birds of appropriate hue, like the

thrush or parrot. Fever is transferred to a frog by pouring water over the patient and putting a frog under the bed ;x the connexion of the frog with the disease may be very old. An interesting means of finding out the presencein 

a house of a demon like a Pi9aca is to hang up in the house kindling wood, andthe strew for the sacrifice : if they are moved, the presence of the spiritis certain.2 

Diseases are specially often the subjects of exorcism in one form or another a woman suffering from lung disease must be rubbed by a chaste man witfc balls of fresh lotus leaves, limb by limb, and thereafter the leaves are thrownto the west.3 He who suffers from an inherited disease is deluged with water and a plough is held, apparentlya mixture of washing and contact.4 Diarrhoea is dealt with by tying a string round a bunch of Munja grass, and giving the patient to eat earth from a field and from an ant-heap.5 Sick cows are made to drink salt water.6 

4. The Attraction of Beneficial Substances and Powers The sacrificer must avail himself of the same means to attack his enemies as they use to attack him : if the enemy assail, the skilled priest can send against them the demon Apva which seems to be the diarrhoea caused byterror, and to symbolize in emphatic fashion the fear produced by panic in battle : this performanceis already recorded in the Rigveda.7 So also it is perfectly in keeping with the ideas of magic that terror and fear would be conveyed to the enemy by the process of sending a white-footed one, presum ably a sheep, against the opposing host.8 In such a case Apva is indeed a dreadful thing, but it is in the control of the priest and therefore useful to him. In other cases he has more direct control : he can use one substance for wash ing himself, another he can drink or eat, another use as an amulet ; with yet another he can rub or anoint himself.9 The avoidance of the touch of anything dangerous is one side of a practice, of which the other is the touching of things which are beneficial. The touching of the victim has two sides : it may convey the death to which the victim is being led, but it may also convey and this is the view which Brahman logic10finally adoptsthe power and strengthof the divine essence. Hence we have an enormousnumber of rites, the standing on a tiger-skin to obtain royal power, the use of an antelope-skin, the placingof the wife on a bull's hide, the placingof her and of the student upon a stone to attain firmness, the depositingat the fire-piling and other offerings on the placeof the fire altar of a piece of earth

from an ant-heap, since the ants as finders of waters give richness : the sameants per contra are often used to destroy dangerous substances like the remnants of offerings. 

Various strange messes are prescribed for eating: the least unpleasant maybe the mixture of milk, of cow-dung, of bdellion, and salt which is taken at anagricultural offering: the burying of a similar mess could, however, produce equal results.1 The wife must eat a barley-corn with two beans attached to secure a male 2 and a strong infant. A peculiarly unpleasant drink, in whichthe members of a cow form an element, will secure all desires. The commoneating of the king and the priest3 and of the bride and bridegroom show that unity of essence was thus produced : it may be conjectured4 that the Tanu naptra ceremony was originally of this kind, though the common eating has disappeared. The idea would then be that he who injured any of those united to him by the common meal would injure himself. The use of anointingis often recorded : an enemy might be injured by anointing sweat on reed arrow-points and offering them.5 The king and the sacrificer at the royal consecration and the Sautrfimani were formally anointed and so on. Othermeans are breathing, as upon the new-born child to give it life, and the putting of substances in the nose to produce offspring.6 

The eyes should not see many things, such as the taboos imposed on the Snataka and his teacher, but, on the other hand, the eye may have purifying influence, and hence with the eye of Mitra the guest may look on what is given to him.7 But the glance of a snake is deadly,8 and so may the glanceof the bride be : therefore her husband placessalve on her eyes to secure his safety.9 

In a number of interesting cases effective results are produced by usingin the rite things connected with the object to be attained. Thus for a prince in exile it is well in the rite to use, for the kindling wood to cook a magicdrink, wood from a stump of a tree which has grown again, or to place on the fire altar earth from his old realm. To defeat the ants when troublesome the use of a ladle of Badhaka wood is valuable, as Badhaka means*repelling'. If victory in battle is the object, earth which a boar has torn up may be placed on the altar, and thus give the rite the strength of the boar. 

In other cases burying things produces good results, as in the buryingabove referred to of a curious mixture for the prosperityof the herds : so too the burying of hair and other objects such as nails. On the other hand, it is necessary to provide rites to dig up objects, such as one's own hair and nails, which an enemy has buried : a special ceremony for this is mentioned in the Taittiriya Samhita.10

For the purposeof protection the use of amulets is very common indeed : it is not indeed quiteclear exactly what idea was conceived to be embodied in the use of these amulets. In the opinionof Oldenberg,1 the view taken of the amulet was, in the first instance, that there was in it a spirit which took its abode therein, but in the periodof the Vedic belief the view had been altered by a process of development,so that the effect of the amulet is produced by a substance resident therein.2 It is, however, a little difficult to accept this view of the developmentof ideas. The view that the first element is spirit, and that the belief in the utility of the amulet is due to the view that a spiritis living in it, is unnecessarilyrefined : the fact, admitted by Oldenberg,that the amulet is not rarely addressed and treated as having an actual spirit in it, is mostnaturally of all explained by the fact of animatism : the amulet is conceived to be a living substance : only by a natural development of thought is there any element of a non-spiritual substance found. Animism in the strict sense of the word, therefore, need hardly come into operation,in so far as it postulates the belief in a mere detachable spirit. 

The potency of nakedness as a magic rite is seldom mentioned save for rain spells : the Kaucjka3, however, tells how to expiate a day of ill omen bysitting naked and rubbing the forehead, and in its collection of spells for inducing slumber in women it prescribes nakedness in the performerof a rite, 

consisting in the besprinklingof the place where she is from a vessel full of water and the remains of an offering. 

5. Mimetic Magic 

In one special class of cases the effect which it is desired by magic means to produce in nature is brought about by the simple plan of representingin sensible form, within the means available to man, the operations which it is desired should take place* Thus when an enemy is to be defeated4it is useful to break in two a piece of grass which is thrown towards the opposing host : the breakingof the grass symbolizes the breaking in two of the armed foemen. Or the rite can be made more effective in quite a simple way : as a daughter-in-law by an old taboo is expected to shrink away from her father-in-law, so by taking the hostile enemy as the daughter-in-law, and by

addressing to it the remark that the father-in-law is looking at it, the hostile army will then break up in utter confusion.1 More elaborate instances of the same thing are of course the ceremonies of the Mahavrata, where the water thrown on the fire produces rain, and the winning of the white round skin 

which represents the sun is a spell representing the recovery of the sun fromthe hostile powers affectingit. In the royal consecration the victory of the king over his rival is graphically depicted in mimic form : his success in dicing2 is a pictureof his success in the position of king on earth. Thefertility of the earth and of the cropsis produced by the mimicry of sexual relationships at the Soma sacrifice, at the horse sacrifice, and by the actual performance of ritual intercourse at the Mahavrata offering. At the Vajapeyathe chariot race is a magic performanceto secure the pre-eminenceof the sacrificer, just as in the rite he is made to be the victor in the race in question.3 The Sautramam offeringis a clear imitation of the story of the healing '"of Indra from his intoxication with Soma after the slaying of the demonNamuci :4 it is used to secure the sacriiicer the success for which he is anxious in whatever sphereof life he may live. This sort of magic is particularly common in rain magic :5 herbs are often dippedin water, black giirmcnts assumed, black victims offered. One rite is of interest : the heads of a dogand a rani, hairs, arid old shoes lire fastened to the end of a bamboo, andpasses arc made in the air as if in combat with a demon : the animals maybe intended to aid in the breaking open of the sky, just as at the Mahavratathe shooting of arrows through, but not so as to penetrate, a skin, is pre sumably intended to let the waters of the skies flow down on the earth. 

The death of a man can be, as in all lands, compassed thus in many ways : an image of him may be made of wax and melted or it may be pierced to the heart, or again his shadow, which is in some degreethe man, may be likewise treated : again a chameleon may be killed and formally burned in mimicry of the rite of the burningof the dead man.6 The footmark of a maiden can be used as a means of winning her love :7 the footmark of a beleaguered king is scattered to the winds.8 Worms are generally to be banished by the crushing and the burning of twenty-one selected UIra worms.9 The running away of a slave or some other persons may be prevented by the idiotic rite of pouring round the person affected the urine of the performer from the horn of a living animal, a symbol of strength : the urine represents the personto whom the slave belongs, and thus the personin living presenceis in the vicinity andprevents the slave from running away.10 The destruction of misfortune of anykind often takes the shape of the burning or throwing away in water of old

things such as garments, sunshades or shoes.1 To destroy the borer insect which is damaging crops, one of the speciesis buried, head downwards, the mouth closed with thread, to prevent further depredations.2 When the Somais being pressed, he who desires to destroy a foe should think of him as he pounds with the pressing stone : the poundingwill directlyaffect the foe. More amusing is the device to be adopted to secure the transfer of a stream from one course to another : the new bed desired is watered, plantslike the Avaka are put along it, and a frogis also put there. The stream will therefore follow the path thus laid down.3 The same principleis at work in the rule by which objects to be attained arc often expressedin a speechas so won. Thus when the wife is given an offering to look at in the ceremony of the parting ofthe hair and is asked,' What dost thou say ?'she replies,*Offspring.' Similarly in the rite to attain male offspring her answer as to what she drinks, in the magic drink given to her, is the producingof a son. The husbandand wife on the fifth day after the wedding ask a young Brahman what he sees, to which he replies,'Sons and cattle.'4 So in the rite of the animal offering the question,'Is it ready ?'has always the answer that it is ; in the plough festival6 the questionof the wife whether the ploughing has been accomplished receives an affirmative reply ; and such cases are to be found in every important rite. A mode of divination can be made a mode of conveying good fortune in this way : thus a merchant, going on a journey, placesballs of dung on the limbs of a friendly Brahman and asks what sort of day it is, to which the latter replies that it is good and lucky.6 

6. Divination and Ordeal 

The principle of divination is in large measure directly due to the doctrine of mimetic magic :7 if the use of a representationof things can produce them, it is also legitimate,if less easy, to deduce the future of events from the behaviour of things, which are supposedto be an imitation of the events. 

This, however, is no doubt not the whole ground of the belief in the power to read the future, and, moreover, the fact that the future was uncertain musthave induced many peopleto resort to the gods for aid in unravellingit. In these cases the performancesare indeed much the same as in an ordinary species of divination, but the belief is different : it is the view that the future is revealed by the god, through the means employed : magic here is supple mented as often by religious conceptions.

The use of means is very varied : the fire of the sacrifice and the victim at the sacrifice are specially suited to give knowledge by their magic connexion with the gods as well as religious conceptions : more clearly connected with the activity of divine powers in Vedic belief is the drawing of omens from the flight and the movements of animals, which are specially clearly connected with birds or beasts, with gods or spirits of the dead or demons. Whena ceremony is performed to win for a maiden a husband, the side from whichcrows first appear is that from which her wooer will come.1 The movementof the cow at a particular moment in the Soma sacrifice shows the fortune of the sacrificer.* The clear flaming of the fire at a sacrifice brings with it the prospect of twelve villages for the sacrificer ; if it smokes, of at least three.8 JVLore interesting is the rule that, when the body of the dead is being burned, the soul will go to the heaven, atmosphere,or the earth according as the eastern, western, or southern fire first reaches it,4 The owl is invoked to fly round the village and give signs for the future : it is a bird which flies to the dwellings of the gods, and the Rigveda already knows birds of omen.5 Thehyena's howl is uttered cither of its own will, or on the prompting of other powers.6 The battle's result can be judged by the lighting of a special fire on a suitable place and observing the movements of the fire, or it can be fore casted by taking three bowstrings, and placing them on a fire : the move ments of the three, of which the middle one is treated as death, will show the event : that which keeps clear from it will represent the victorious army, that which comes into contact with it the army which is to be ruined.7 Thecharacter of the bride can be judged by the choice by her of balls of earth chosen from very various places:8 the sex of the future child by the fact whether the member of the body of the prospective mother which a Brahmanboy touches has a masculine or feminine name.9 

The meanings of dreams is an interesting partof Vedic magic and is dealt with in various lULvajrr*. including an Atharvan Pariista. The Rigveda10 already regards as ominous the making of a garland or neckband in a dream. Ten dreams which forebode death are recorded in the Aitareya Aranyaka :nwhen one sees in a dream a black man with black teeth who kills him, when a boar kills him, when a wild cat springs on him, when one eats and then spits out gold, when one eats honey and lotus roots, when one goesto a village with asses or boars, or when one drives south a black cow with a black calf, wearing

a garland of nard. If one has a dream, one should, as we have seen, wash one's mouth. The view is also held that certain stars are unlucky, especially Mula.1 Moreover, many sights forebode evil : the sun seeming as the moon,the heaven red like madder, when one's shadow appears upside down in a mirror or water, or when one's head smells like a crow's nest.2 Evil is further portended by meteors and lightning. Of ominous birds the main classes are those which are black or whose appearance or utterance is horrible : the pigeon, the owl, the vulture, the Dirghamukhl, &c., but the bird is also called generally the mouth of Dissolution. Birds,3too, are said to go about in the semblance of the Fathers, other animals are seldom mentioned in this regard ; the fact that a horse on several occasions is used to forecast prosperity, or other results, is rather due to its connexion with the offering than to its intrinsic nature as ominous, though fortune in popular superstition can be inferred from the neighingof a horse.4 Other prodigies are the appearance of an ant-heap in the house, the making of honey there by the bees, the screamof a jackal, the drinkingof one cow from another, the cows giving blood for milk, and so on.5 

The existence of men skilled in the interpretation of omens is natural and is also recorded, as for instance in the case of the men who could tell the marks which led to luck or otherwise in the choice of a wife. We hear also of a prophet who made his prophecies on the basis of the smoke of dung, the fakadhuma of the Atharvaveda, whose business it was, it is clear, to fore cast the weather.6 We learn also of men who by the means of plants such as the Sadampuspa 7 were able to behold sorcerers male and female, whetherthey went in the sky or on the earth : the same idea of the power of socerers to assume various forms is found in the Rigveda8 where it asks for the destruction of the demons, who in form of birds fly about the village at night. Necromancy, however, is not apparently known,9 nor the inspection, on a system, of the entrails of the victims, in order to read the future. 

The ordeal is nothing more than a form of divination in one of its aspects ; the idea in it is not that the deity would actually punish an accused person so much as that it should by its treatment of him show whether or not he is innocent of the charge made against him. But the analogy of the ordeal to the oath in which the swearer invokes a penalty on himself, if he is telling untruth, shows that the separation of the ideas of punishment and discrimina tion cannot be assumed to have been present to the Vedic mind :10 the form

of ordeals recorded for early Vedic times shows the prevalence of punishmentat the same time as the test of fact : the Rigveda has not any certain exampleof the ordeal : the only Brahmana cases are those in which Vatsa asserts his purity of Brahmanical origin by walking through the fire without harmaffecting him,1 Tri^oka'sassertion of superior Vedic knowledge by a fire ordeal and the successful crossing of a stream, and the glowing axe whichis brought up for the purposeof testing the accused thief.2 The fire as asentient power by failing to burn or by burning shows innocence or guilt: but it punishes at the same time, and this is roughly speaking true of someof even the later ordeals, such as the poison and water ordeals.3 A procedure to prevent the burning of the hand in the ordeal of plunging the hand into boiling oil to extract a piece of goldis prescribedin the Kau^ika.4 

7. The Magic Spell 

The power of the word is very marked in all systems of magic and naturally not least in India. The magic spellis sometimes in prose,in the style of the formulae used by the Adhvaryus at the sacrifice, more often in verse, some times newly made for the purpose, sometimes, and indeed very often, chosen without any appropriateness from the vast body of existing sacred literature. Of this latter tendency two examples may be given : the number available is legion. The finest hymn to Varuna in the Vedic literature is found in the Atharvaveda where it has been preservedin a charm.5 The great hymnof the Rigveda, which celebrates the god Prajapati in the form of questions, has the second verse used in a spell for preventing the miscarriage of a cow, doubtless for no better reason than that the idiotic system on which namesof authors were assigned to every hymn of the collection resulted in postulat ing an author Hiranyagarbha,c he of the golden womb ', really an epithetof thp supreme god, and the fact that the deity was Prajapati.6 v' Of the spell one characteristic is the regularity with which many gods are invoked : it is absurd to suppose that in these enumerations there wasnormally any sense of the different deities invoked : all that was desired wasto strengthen the spell by the utterance of as many names of deities as possible : in some cases the mention of individuals is dropped and merely the numbers arc given, 99 or 88 or 77 and so on : the fondness for such numbers

is a feature of many forms of magic.1 Analogous to this feature is the fact that when anything is to be dealt with every conceivable place where it may be is Enumerated : a disease is banished, not merely from the place where it is paining the person afflicted, but from all his members. On the other hand, where possible the exact name and origin of the thing dealt with must begiven : if one can name father and mother so much the better : the drum2 is described as coming from the lord of the forest and strung by the cows. Some times names of, to us, inexplicable and perhaps esoteric character are given, such as hrudu appliedin the Atharvaveda8 to fever, in accordance with the well-known rule that in magic a mysterious name is the most potentof all.4 

v A second characteristic of the spellsis the stress laid on the recital of comparisons which have magic effect in producing the results desired. Thekidneys are made to settle themselves firmly by comparison with the mountainswhich abide for ever, or the bird which is at rest in its nest, or the cows whichhave come back to the stall.5 The amulet is made effective by the fact that it was the one bound by the Daksayanas on Qatanika.6 The dying round the Brahman, which is prescribedin the Aitareya Brahmana7 as the spell parexcellence of the Purohita against the foes of his master, is accompanied bycomparison with the mode in which the constellations appear and set again. The birth of the embryo is encouraged by the comparison with the wind whichmoves the lotus pond on all sides,8 and so on indeiinitely. The use of the word'grow*is necessary when the Arundhati plant is addressed in order to heal a broken bone :*below ','away ', are used when a disease is expelled: if one practises witchcraft, one should use the wordfc broken' when offering a cup : in bringing about harmony the wordfc in unison'is of value. Theimportance of the name has already been mentioned : it results in the giving to each child of a secret name. Nor is there missing the rite by whicha formula is repeated backwards : if the offering priestis interrupted bythe servants of the sacrificer, he should repeat backwards the Da^ahotrformula, and thus bring the sacrifice to ruin.tt The use of harsh words like phot, &c., is mentioned possibly even as earlyas the Rigveda.10 

^ The word has special force in the form of the curse, which is often recorded in Vedic literature and which as is well known is one of the most commonmotives in later Indian literature. Fish are killed out of hand by men, because they betrayedto the gods Agni when he fled for shelter to the waters and for that deed Agni cursed them to be slain by men.11 The trees which

caused illness to the gods were cursed by the gods to be destroyed by a handle of the woodman's axe, made from their own bodies.^ The curse is often men tioned as being invoked to recoil on the curscr himself, showing that it wasa common form of magic attack. It might also be heightened in effect by aformal offering, in which the rules of the sacrifice are violated and the points of reeds are sacrificed to the accompaniment of formulae declaring that the sacrificer takes from the enemy, who has played him false with his wife, hopeand sight, children and cattle, breathing in and breathing out.2 The curse3 in the Brahmanas is constantly expressed in a curious form : if a man per forms an act in the offering incorrectly, then he places himself in such a posi tion that, if any one were to say of or to him something unpleasant, that wouldcome true. The point is clear : the mistake exposes the man guilty of it to the risk of the effective working of any curse which is invoked upon him. 

The Vedic oath is often recorded : the king at the great consecration recorded by the Aitareya Brahmana must swear to his priest to be true, at the cost otherwise of all his merit in sacrifice and gifts to the priests since the bcpiminn of his life, his good deeds, his offspring, passing from him on the occasion of his falsehood.4 But a still older form of oath recorded6is by cows, or waters, or Varuria,6 and the Indian to this day swears in some cases by

Ganges water which he holds in his hand. The legal literature7 allows oaths for a Brahman by his truth, for a Ksatriya by his teams and weapons, and for a Vaicya by his cows, grain and gold, but these are not recorded for the Vedic period, and the first is modem in appearance as compared with the Vedic oaths. Later, too, we find that the touchingof oneself in the oath was not 

rare, as showing the spirits the person to be punished if the oath were not kept : this usage is proved for late Vedic times by the provision that the touch in such a case is, like the offering to Rudra, a ground for purification by means of water.8 Possibly, too, the curses recorded that a man's head shall fly off, which is paralleled by the Buddhist malediction that the head should split in seven pieces, may be connected with this idea of touching the head.8 A joint curse is that of the Tanunaptra rite, which is an oath of fidelity of the priest and the sacrificer in the Soma sacrifice, with a curse on the violator of the oath. There is in the Aitareya Brahmana 10 an echo of the famous storyof the lotus theft, in which the various persons accused of stealing the lotus fibres declared themselves guiltless by the device of invoking the most dreadful

misfortunes on the head of the thief, while the true thief, the god himself, revealed his nature by invoking nothing but good,f The classical instance of a broken oath is that of Soma, who is punishedfor falling to keep his promise to dwell with the twenty-sevenwives whom he received from Prajapati, by the disease Rajayaksma, perhaps consumption.1 

8. The Magic Sacrifice 

In many cases the sacrifice itself is degraded to mere magic : this is a precise parallel to the degradationof the formulae to spells which we have already seen, and of which the mystic Hotr formulae, originally of a superior typeof thought, but later degradedto common magic purposes,are the best example. 

The actual sacrifice itself may be adaptedto magical ends : thus to secure the opposite of the natural results the sorcerer performsit with the arrangement reversed as far as may be : the movements are not from south to north and from left to right, but from north to south, the region of the dead, and

from right to left. Or again the offering verse in a sacrifice for Indra may be addressed to the Maruts, and vice versa in an offering to the Maruts. TheKau<?ika Sutra has full descriptions of black magic, an idea which has never been without votaries and which in the Middle Ages attained great fame.2 More directly the sacrifice becomes not merely in the theosophyof the Brah mans the great powerof the universe : more prosaicallyit becomes the meansby which the sorcerers who practise magic against one can be made to showthemselves, by which rival wives can be overcome, by which the monarch in exile can regain his throne.8 The sacrifice can be adaptedto these ends by anymanipulations of its component parts or by the precise mode in which the ritual acts are performed. 

Slightly different is another method of producing magic results : in this case the nature of the offering chosen differs essentially from the ordinary sacrifice : thus ants are offered poison ;* for a rival reed-points are sacrificed, the order of sacrifice being also altered ;5 to win cattle,6 dung of a pair of calves, to win sheep, of a pairof sheep,is offered : longlife is aimed at byoffering nails of Khadira wood ; and from the practice of passing people

through holes to rub off evil or make them invisible to their foes, the use of sacrificing through a hole*naturally came into existence. 

In one other respect the magicianavails himself of the forms of the ordinary sacrifice. One of the most important ingredientsin every magiaoffering is the Sarhpata, the remnant of the butter offering made at the newanct full moon, and the Kauika Sutra2 contains precise instructions for the performance of these offerings, though it would be erroneous to imagine with Caland 3 that every magic ceremony requiredto be accompanied by such a rite, a rule which would have restricted the workings of magic to a very short period.4 In the operationsof his ceremonies the magician follows closely the ordinary rites of sacrifice : the personin whose interest he sacrifices takes stalks of Darbha grass and touches the priest with them to establish close contact with him, and smells the smoke of the oblations made in the lire by the priest.5 On the other hand, it is characteristic of the special nature of the rite that it is performedin the north-eastern quarter away from the village,6 andwhen it is completedthe performers wash themselves in the stream near which the rite has been carried out, and return to the village, never turning roundlest they may see the dread presences which they have evoked. The materials of the magic rite, apart from the frequent use of uneatable materials, are in the main the same as those of the ordinary ritual, but the diverse varieties of butter found in that ritual are replaced by the regular use of Ajya alone, while the Ingida is often mentioned as an ingredient.7Specialinterest attaches to the frequent use of earth from an ant-heap: as we have seen, the ant, doubtless owing to its skill and industry, was regardedas an uncanny animal by the Vedic Indian, and possibly experience may have provedthe existence of some value in the earth. An interesting excursion into the realm of sacrifice is made by this belief : in the ceremony of the piling of the fire altar, when the clay for the making of the bricks has been collected, the priestis to gaze at it through an ant-heap,i.e. presumably through a tunnel made in such a heap. The explanation of this rite is obscure : Henry8suggests comparisonwith the German superstition that by wearing a moleskin a man can see sorcerers : possibly the medium of an ant-heapconferred on the priests the faculty of discerning whether any evil influences were affectinghis materials. Another curious ingredientis lead, and its three substitutes, iron filings, dried river foam, and a lizard's head.9 Woods of various kinds play a large part: onelist 10 enumerates twenty-two kinds of value, and is not exhaustive as it omits

the Avattha, which is often in fact employedin magic rites. But scarcely anything from an elephant's tooth or hair1 downwards comes amiss to the sorcerer, who in India as elsewhere is anxious to increase the importanceof his action by asserting that his ingredients have been obtained from afar : 

an antidote against snakes is dug up on the ridges of the mountain with shovels of gold by the little Kirata maiden,2 an assertion with which we may, if we will, compare the practice not rarely recorded, under which peopleof higher culture ascribe to those of lower culture possession of superior magic powers.3 

In other respects the parallelism between sacrifice and magic ceremony is extremely close : in both cases the operator expects and receives a reward, but the Kau^ika Sutra only rarely gives us an exact measure of the Daksinapayable : in some cases the materials used may have been the fee,1 but often these would be too worthless or too valuable and it is reasonable to believe 6 that the fee was usuallyfixed by agreement. The magic ceremonycan serve most of the purposesof the formal sacrifice : just as a main object of the regular offering is long life, so an infinity of charms provide life, andamulets of varied kinds are provided by the magician. There are spells for the house, to guard against fire, to bring rain, to secure increase of cattle, to pre vent injury and increase the growthof crops, to secure safety on a journey or trade venture and success in gambling. Spells provide success in the assembly, bring victoryin war, restore an exiled king, produce harmony or discord among the several classes of the people just as sacrifices do. Even morethan sacrifice are magic ceremonies adapted to secure success in love, the over throw of rivals, constancy between husband and wife, the birth of a son rather than of a daughter, safetyin child-birth, and the protectionof the life, always precarious and doubly so in such a climate as that of India, of the infant, andspells as well as sacrifices protect the whole adolescence and life of man.Specially rich in spellsis the domain of medicine : remedies are providedin this way against many diseases, includingintestinal worms, to which the Vedic Indian attributed many diseases with which they had no concern ; fever whoseseveral varieties were already known from their periods of recurrence ; wounds and fractures, one formula used having some faint claim to be Indo European in character ;6 skin affections including even leprosy ;7 the effects of poison ; and even perhaps diseases ranked as hereditary.8 The meansemployed are often obscure, and, while traces of some medical knowledge are not wanting the use of the probe9 has been recognized by Henry10 and

Caland l in the main the spell seems to be relied on, together with symbolic acts for banishing, for example, the yellow jaundice to the yellow bird. A question of some difficulty presentsitself as to the performersof these magic rites. Many of them are of such simplicity that it would appearobvious that they could be carried out by each householder for himself, for example, the rites to secure the safety of the cattle against wild beasts while grazing andtheir safe return at evening.2 Nor can we reasonably doubt that in the first instance the householder was his own magician as well as sacrificer.3 But in the Kau$ika Sutra, as is natural, we find it assumed throughoutthat the performer of the rite is essentially the Brahman priest, whose Veda the Atharvaveda essentially is, and that no rite has any value without his presence. We may, therefore, assume that by the time of the Sutra, and even earlier, the control of magic had largelyfallen into the hands of these priests, and this fact accords well with their clearly increasing importance in the history of the sacrifice proper,4 in which the services of the Brahman in making good byhis presence and his skill defects in the ritual win for him the credit of the performance of half the sacrifice. 

Henry,5 however, goes much further than this and insists that the Brahmanwas the first of priests, originally a magician, and that the spellis the primitive form whence prayerhas emerged, as from the magician the priest has evolved with the growth of religion. Common as this view is, it is clear that it has no support in historical evidence, as in the Rigveda Brahman, both masculine and neuter, means normally priest and prayer, not magician and spell,6 andas a theory of religionit must be held to be as defective as are all theories which endeavour to develop religion from something essentially not religious.7 

It is of interest to note that, while in the main the magician is content to use the Vedic pantheon as it appears in the sacrificial ritual, he is also pre pared when necessary to fashion fresh figures or to modify those already existing. While Rudra in his forms as Bhava and arva i s invoked in a hymn8 against internal disease in terms which are suggestive of the popularfavour which was to turn him into fiva, the great god, Visnu takes an inferior place, though the representationof his three steps can be used to strengthen the magic act.9 The Apsarases appearin close connexion with dice, possibly as Henry 10 holds in the main because the term krid,*play ', applies to thempar excellence : such linguistic considerations are of real importancein Vedic

thought. In battle charms we find not merely Apva, the spirit of panic and its physical result, but also Trisandhi, which is clearly Indra's bolt, Arbudi, andNyarbudi, who is plainly but a verbal variant of the former.1 In Henry'sview 2 Arbudi himself is a duplicate of Indra, like Namuci, but this view is much less probable than that of Bloomfield,3 who sees in him an old derivative of Arbuda, the cloud serpentslain by Indra, who comes to be regarded later merely as a serpent divinity and auspicious,like Taksaka, who also figures in the Atharvaveda.4 It is characteristic of the Atharvaveda that Asura in independent passages has always an evil sense, that abstract deities like Arati, 5illiberality towards priests, and perhaps Nirrti,6 dissolution, take a pro minent place, and that a faded mythological figurelike the mysteriousTrita appears, in the form Trta,7 in connexion with a hymn which is interpreted as an expiation for the somewhat venial fault of marrying before an elder brother, a fact on which is based the theory of Max Miiller,8 which Henryinclines to approve,that Trta is the departingsun. On the model of Pusan is created the god Susan, from su,'beget;,who is invoked to secure safe delivery.9 

One direct addition to our knowledge of the ordinary sacrificial ritual is made by the Atharvaveda, which in its last, late, book has a section of hymnsstyled collectively Kuntapa.10 The contents of this collection is very varied, but it includes several riddles, in part obscene, as well as a panegyricof a king :n doubtless we must assume that these are fragments of popular12 merriment in connexion with sacrificial rites which have been stereotyped. 

In the sacrificial ritual, however, the most interesting of the innovations of the Atharvavedins is the introduction of rites regarding the presentation of the presents claimed by the priests. Instead of mere appendicesto the actual offering, these become in themselves offerings of the highest importance 

and value.18 The other ritual texts14 know of Savas as consecrations for various rites of importance, but in the Kau^ika15 the Sava is essentially the ceremony

which centres in the giving of largesse to the priests. The Atharvaveda has many hymns in connexion with these donations, two l of which are noteworthyin connecting an prdinary Soma rite with the formal preparation and cooking of porridge for the priests, one preparer boastingthat he is the fifteenth of his line who has performedthe operation: in other cases animals are the fees, andare extolled in the most exaggerated terms as divine : the goat2 recalls AjaEkapad, that faded mythological figure of the Rigveda. In another8 case a house is taken to pieces and presentedto the Brahman. A counterpart to these demandsfor fees is the stress laid on the sacred character of the Brahman: his wife is inviolable : nay Soma has made over to him his claim to the first mating with every woman.4 His cow6is equally sacrosanct, and on thestrength of his own sanctity he can demand, when such a portentas the birth of twin calves takes place, that the erring cow should be made over to himas alone fitted to be its master.6 

9. Yoga Practices 

The ritual, as has been seen, both in the case of magic and of the sacrifice, is full of elements which appear systematizedin the later Yoga philosophy and practice. But it would be a mistake to exaggeratethe degreeof corre spondence, and in point of fact much that is later characteristic and essential is lacking in the earlier Vedic literature.7 In special hardly any trace can befound of the importancelater attaching to elaborate regulation of the breath, despite the fact that the division of the breaths or vital airs as five is early. The suggestion that the term gusma is a word with ecstatic implications is wholly implausible. The inducing of perspirationas a part of the Diksa and as a means of exciting ecstasyis clear, but it does not appearas a distinct or important rite as with the Scythiansof Herodotos or the aborigines of NorthAmerica or Australia. Nor do we find any clear reference to the various sitting postures familiar to the later Yoga, for it is absurd to believe that the sense*altar ', if it ever really belongsto the obscure term Dhisana, owes its origin to the fact that by his postureat the placeof sacrifice the priest beholds the might (dhi$an&) of the gods. The mysterious Uttanapad of the Rigveda8 as a cosmic power cannot with any plausibility be deemed to yield a proof of the practice of assuming the position of an embryo in the womb as a meansof attaining mystic rebirth. That silence and solitude were conducive to ecstasy is, curiously enough, little referred to, and the dirt of both person andgarments of the later Yogin is recognized only in a few hints.9 There is moreevidence of fasting, and the hymn of Lopamudra and Agastya in the Rigveda10 1 AV, xi. 1 ; xii. 8.'

appears, despite its obscurity, to express the two kindred ideas of the magicpotency engendered by continence on the one hand, and on the other of the cosmic importance of the rite of generation, both doctrines of the later system.1 The idea of a mystic union between the god and the worshipper, which finds its highest development in the akti cults of Bengal, appears wholly unknownto Vedic literature,2 and dancing as a means of producing ecstasy is never mentioned, though the gods as dancers may be a relic of the conception. Thesongs, and their musical accompaniments, together with the ritual exclama tions which are preservedin the Song-books of the Samaveda, may haveserved a similar purpose ; sound may often have accomplishedresults of spiritual excitement irrespective of the words, and the term Vipra, used of the poet, seems to suggest the trembling or quaking of divine inspiration.8 

More important than these facts is the striking description of the Munifound in one late Rigveda hymn.4 He differs entirely from the Brahmanstudent or the man undergoing consecration, for his ecstasy is not connected either with the sacrifice or with any of the rites ancillary to it or to the entry of the youth into the full life of the community. His mortal body men see, but he himself fares on the path of the Apsarases, the Gandharvas, the beasts of the wild, he dwells in the east and the western ocean, the steed of Vata, the friend of Vayu, inspired by the gods. He knows secret desires, he is the dearest friend, he supports Agni and both the worlds, he is the heaven and the light, and his ecstasy,it seems, is due to a potent draught which, with Rudra,he drinks from a goblet, perhaps a reference to the use of some poison to pro duce exhilaration or hypnosis.5 His hair is long,his soiled garments are of yellow hue. 

This descriptionis curiously isolated in the Rigveda and later, not un naturally, since this aspect of religious life does not fall within the normaloutlook of our texts. In the Atharvaveda,6 however, we find the curious andenigmatical figure of the Vratya, exalted into a cosmic power, and therefore of obscure origin. It has been suggested that we are to find in him the typeof Yogin, produced in the eastern lands under the aegis of the Ksatriyas, whowandered about the country, received with friendship in the courts, bringing prosperity in his train by reason of his ecstatic practices, in which a part wastaken by the hetaera, who is made part of his retinue, and the Magadha whoseloud cries doubtless played a partin his rites. The suggestionis ingenious, but unfortunately it lacks any probative value. The references to the year long standing of the Vratya and his other actions are too indistinct to enable us to discern with any certainty the outlines of an ancient seeker after ecstatic trances, and the elaboration of his retinue, though it may be paralleledin other lands,7 is strange to Indian usage.

PART IV. THE SPIRITS OF THE DEADCHAPTER 23   

THE ABODES OF THE DEAD 

1. The Nature of the Dead 

IT is not altogether easy to derive from the Rigveda a precise conception of the nature which was attributed to the spirits of the dead by the mind of the people or of the priest, and it is natural to assume that the ground for this difficulty is to be traced to the variation of both popular and ecclesiastical opinion. The modern view of the spirits and their abode is extremely varied and confused, and it would be ill-judged to assume that it was otherwise in the earlier Vedic religion. 

Long before the periodof the Rigveda, it is clear that the Indian hadrealized the difference between life and death and had separatedin his imagination the two elements of the man, his body and his spirit,1 but the dis tinction must have been vague in the extreme.2 Of the spirit as distinct from the body we have two expressions which occur frequently enough to let us believe that their meaning was more or less definitely known : of these the first was what we would regard as physical, but what doubtless seemed just as psychical to the Vedic India as any other aspect of the spirit: it is the asu,9 life, which seems clearly to have been based on the conception of the breath of the man, which is the visible sign of life and intellect : later, but not in the Rigveda, the term Atman, the breath, is the most characteristic term for the self, and the breaths, Pranas, are a constant subject of investigation in the Upanisads, where often they appear as essentially representing the life andspirit of man. The identification of breath and the asu is made formally in the atapatha Brahmana,4 but this fact is of much less importance than the clear indications of the Rigveda. The other term is, unlike asu, whichnever in later times became an expressionof any philosophical importance, one which never loses a placein the thought of India, though it does not achieve the rank of the Atman. It is Manas, the mind, which in later Indian

thought is of importanceas the means of knowledge of all internal events,1 and a necessary link in the knowledge of external events en route from the senses. The conceptionof the Rigveda is seen clearly in the casea when the mind of a senseless personis said to have gone away to Yama, the lord of the dead, to sky and earth, to the sea and the mountains, to the sun and the dawn.It is also probablethat the conception later prevalent that the mind has its abode in the heart was already developed :8 the connexion of mind and heart is not rare in the Rigveda. The further view that the mind had the dimensions of a pigmy or a thumb in size, which is found said of the Purusa as the prin ciple of life in the Upanisads and often later, is not to be proved for the period of the Rigveda.4 

Naturally enough there is abundant evidence of the simple views whichsuggest the theory of the spirit: the phenomena of loss of the senses, which is recorded in the Rigveda, is also recorded of the ancient Bhrgu, who in this condition went to the other world and had experiences of interest there.5 The view that in the case of a dream the soul might be outside the body andmoving about freely at will, which is a common belief of many peoples,is proved by the reference to such a case in the atapatha Brahmana,8 whichwarns us of the danger of waking the sleeper too hurriedly, lest the soul should thus fail to find its way back into the body. It appears also that dreamsabout the dead were deemed to be due to the souls of the dead moving thus about. At least this belief would explain the fact that, on going away froma festival for the dead, the partakerin the rite should rub himself with the Apamarga plant and ask it to wipe away evil dreams.7 The danger of the spirit escaping through yawning seems suggested by the rule that in such a case one should say,*"In me be strength and wisdom '.8 The shadow also is here and there found as beingin some way connected with man : if one cannot see his reflection it is an omen of death, and the reflection of one whose mindis gone can be used in a spell to restore his mind to him.9 All these elements can be supposed to have been steadily at work in Vedic India, and the result is the conception of the spirit as some more or less impalpable substance. It is not asu entirely nor mind : it is also breath, and it is very often regarded as

asu and mind :x or it appearsas mind or as asu, as in the frequent phrase asumti,*asu leading ',2 which is applied both to the process by which the spirits are led from the earth to their home in the sky, and the reverse pro cess by which they are brought back by Agni,as the conveyer of souls, fromthe heaven in which they live to the offerings made to them on earth. It is, however, of importancethat mind is assumed to be with the spirit when it is away from the body : the Fathers of the Vedic creation are thus creatures whoare perfectly giftedfor intellectual action of all kind, to know, to perceive, to enjoy, and to will. But the view as to exactly what it was which departed at death was never quite clearlysettled by the thought of India : the Upani sads inclined to regardit as the Atman, the Buddhist in one view as con sciousness, Vijnana,8 and later there developed more precise views of the psychic apparatus which transmigrated, but the views of the populace were probably as vague as those of Vedic India itself. 

But it would be an error to assume that the body was left for ever at death : this might seem to be the logical view, but it is not the view of the Vedic Indian, as it has not been the view of many different classes of men. Thecare expressed in the Rigveda4 itself for the avoidance of injury to the bodyof the dead, which was to be burned, by a bird or other beast, is confirmed bythe express injunction to the dead that he has in the next world to unite himself with his body. The same idea is expressedin the Atharvaveda,5 which treats as in the next world the body, the asu, the mind, the limbs, andthe sap all uninjured, and the Fathers are entreated to secure that the bones which have been placed out of order shall all be placedin due arrangement. This unquestionablyis the regular view in the Veda : the alternative view once found in the Rigveda,6 which sends the eye of the dead to the sun, the breath to the wind, bids him go to the heaven and the earth, or if he prefers to the waters, and to dwell among the plants with his members, cannot betreated as more than a mere deviation of no great consequencefor the general view of Vedic religion. The connexion of the eye and the sun is also seen in the Purusasukta, where the sacrifice of the primeval giantresults in the sun being created from his eye. The concrete character of the entity which is left in the heaven is proved by the fact that the Fathers are always addressed, when mentioned individually, by their own names : there is no such thing as an invocation of the spirit of any individual. He himself continues his life.

2. The Places of the Dead 

The chief place of the dead in the conceptionof the Rigveda*is unques tionably heaven : the soul leaves the body on death, and by the path of the Fathers it goes to the place where there is eternal light, endowed with lustre like that of the gods.2 It is said to go as by a car or by wings:8 more com pletely the Atharvaveda4pictures the dead man as borne up by the Maruts, with gentle breezes fanning him, and cooled by showers until he recovers his complete body, and meets with the Fathers in the highest heaven, wherewith Yama they dwell. The heaven is called also the home,6 but the idea can hardly be pressed to the view that the goingto heaven is a return home : it is rather that the man reaches in the highest heaven a new and abiding abode. The connexion of this journey of the souls with the actual burning of the bodyis always a vague one, but the reality of the connexion of soul and body is proved by the emphasislaid in the Brahmanas6 on the necessityfor the duecollection of the bones of the dead, and the need of replacing them symbolically in cases where they may happento be lost. 

Another conceptionof the nature of death is hinted at in the legendof the dogs of Yama,7 the four-eyed, a term probably derived from the presenceof some mark on the dog which gave the appearanceof four eyes,8 brindled, broad-nosed, dogs which wander about and guard the path or sit on it : the spirit is bidden to haste past the dogs, and to join the Fathers with Yama.Delighting in lives, they watch men and serve as messengersof Yama, andare entreated to grant continued enjoymentof life. It is possible that they were conceived as going among men, and taking to the abode of death the souls of the dead. The Avestan parallelis one dog, which four-eyed and yellow eared watches the head of the Cinvat bridge9 which reaches from this to the next world, and by his barking scares away the fiends, who would hinder the passing of the souls of the just dead. In the Rigveda there is no clear evidence to any such functions of the dogsas the dividers out of souls as good or bad : the suggestion of Roth 10 and Aufrecht that this was their function is based oninterpretations, which are not very probable, and at any rate are uncertain. In the Atharvaveda u the messengersof Yama appear already as pluralas well as dual. Any possibility of holding that they had duties of discrimination

would of course disappear if they were to be regarded as being really the sunand the moon, as is argued by Bloomfield (the day and the night in the Jaimimya Brlhmana),1 or the doubles of Yama and Yam!, which was the viewof Bergaigne,8 but it is difficult to go beyond the view that the imagination of the Indo-Iranians and, if the identification doubtful in the extreme of Cabala and Kerberos3is to be accepted, probably of the Indo-Europeansalso, believed that the way to the sky was guarded or infested by a dog or dogs. 

The nature of the heaven which is attained by the spiritsis described repeatedly in the Rigveda :4it is further elaborated in the later Samhitas, but all its characteristics are the same : there is light, the sun for the highest waters, every form of happiness, the Svadha, which is at once5 the food of the spirits, and the power which they win by it, their self-determination. Thespirits are so material as not merely to enjoy the most material things, Soma,milk, honey, Sura, ghee, but also to delightin the joysof love,6 a fact indicating how corporeal was their nature. The sound of singing and the flute is also among the delights available, and there is a fig-tree where Yama drinks with the gods.7 There are wish-cows, which yieldall desires, and there is perfect harmony and joy unbounded. The pictureis singularly simple: it is merelythe pleasant things of earth to the priestly imagination, heaped upon oneanother : the total absence of anything which could be regarded as natural in the heaven of warriors is a striking reminder that the conceptions of Vedic India, in so far as they are within reach of our knowledge, were the ideas of priests and not of the whole community. The idea thus presented prevailed throughout the Vedic periods: even in the Brahmanas among speculations of various sorts, it is often said that men obtain unity with the sun, whichclearly means that he goes to dwell in the heaven of the sun where are the Fathers, the gods, and above all Yama.

third heaven, the other two being SavitrX id his is the highest,1 the abodeof the sun which he gives to men. He does so because he was the first of mortals who died, and who found out the wayfor manyto the realm, where nowhe reigns rather than rules as king. In the later Samhitfis2 his connexion with death, which is his path already on the Rigveda,8 and with which he may even be identified there, is more and more emphasized: he is connected with Antaka,*the ender ', Mrtyu,* death ', and Nirrti,*dissolution ', and Mrtyu is his messenger as well as his two, or more, dogs* But he is also the father of men with his sister Yarn!, who bids him in a dialogue of much interest commitincest with her for the creation of the race, a view which Yama on moral grounds reprobatesin the hymn.*In the Avesta Yama is the kingof a distant paradise on earth, the lord of a golden age where no heat or cold or defects exist. He has, though not in the Avesta, a sister Yimeh from whomwith him men are sprung.It is temptingto see in him the king first of a golden age, and then of a realm of the spirits of the heroes of that age, the Rsis mentioned with him as makers of the way to the world to come, as Oldenberg suggests, but the evidence hardly avails to establish this. ForIndia and Iran, however, he is beyond doubt the first of mortals, and therefore also the first to die. The view that he is more than that, a faded divinity, whether Agni as held by Bergaigne,5 or the sun, as Barth6thought, or, as Weber 7suggested, the parting day, Yarn! being then nightin whose gloommay be seen sorrow for Yama, or the setting sun and so the lord of the dead, as taken by Max Miiller,8 is not necessary and is not supported by any decisive evidence : still less plausibleis the effort of Hillebrandt9 to find in him the moon as the mortal child of the sun, even if as he holds this conception wasindeed Indo-Iranian, but no longer a living belief in Vedic times. The effort10 to remove Yarn! from the tradition and to see in Yama the alter ego of the living man, his soul, is clearly contrary to the whole of the Vedic and the Avestan evidence. 

Yama, however, and Varuiia also do not appear as active in the work of controlling the world of the dead : as the great god, Varuna's placeis there,

perhaps too as the god to whom cries proceed for pardon from sin, but neither god is said to punishthe dead or judge them for their sins. The idea of judge ment of any sort is foreign to the Rigveda as to early Iran, and it is only in the Taittiiiya Aranyakax that we have the express statement that the truth ful and the untruthful are separatedbefore Yama, but his activity in this separation is in no wise indicated, and the idea of the weighingof the deeds of man on his arrival in the other world, which is prominent in the Avesta, is only found in the atapatha Brahmana2 in a passageof speculative activity. What the dead obtain in heaven is not only longlife there by the gift of the mercy of the gods: they obtain the merit of the Istapurta, the sacrifices which they have offered, and the gifts which they have given to the priest,8 and at the same time they are nourished by the piety of their relatives onearth, as they have nourished in their turn their forefathers. Such nourish ment may be either buried with them, when the grainsof corn and sesame will become wish-cows and their calves in the heaven, or may be conveyed bythe later offerings.4 It is not a very distant step to the idea of the Buddhists5 that souls which are miserable can be aided by the gift to monks in their name, and the assignmentto them of the merit thus acquired. 

The other side of the belief in heaven is the belief in hell. It is of course in itself perfectly possible that the Vedic Indian might not have believed in the existence of hell : the view that annihilation might be the fate of the souls which did not receive the boon of immortal life from the gods is not in itself absurd, but a hell is a natural complementto heaven, and in point of fact the Rigveda 6 itself seems to contain references to a place of punishment,into which Indra and Soma are to hurl the evil doers so that not one can emerge ; under the three earths is the place of the enemy and robber, and the demoness is to disappear in endless abysses. There occurs here and in a few other places the idea of the eternal punishmentin a placeof deep darkness of the evil.7 The idea of hell is made clear by the Atharvaveda8 which has the wordNaraka Loka in contrast to Svarga, heaven, as the placefor female goblins and sorceresses : it is also the placeof the murderer,9 and appearsas black,

blind or the lowest darkness.1 There is no trace of the fires of hell, nor of a wolf of hell in the Vedic literature,2 nor can the view of Geldner8 that the word Vici in the Rigveda*directly denotes hell be accepted ; but there is reason enough to hold that the idea was presentin germ. The actual tortures of hell are reserved for later texts in the main, and are dwelt on by Buddhismin a way to make us realize that on the popular mind these horrors had due result. In the Atharvaveda6 the sinners who injure the Brahman sit in streams of blood eating hair, and in the atapatha Brahmaija6 and the Jaimimya the proud Bhrgu goesto the other world, where he sees many horrible things such as men being cut to pieces, and men being eaten, and also the lord of the place as a black man with a staff and yellow eyes beside two maidens, one fair and one, described by an epithet atikatydni, as either4very fair'or 4past her beauty '. The Jaimimya mentions three hells and three heavens. Another horror is suggested by the Kausltaki Brahmana,7 which threatens man with being eaten in the next world by the animals which he devoured in this, unless he adopts a certain ritual practice of special potency. The idea of punishment or reward according to one's deeds is constantly expressedin the atapatha Brahmana8 under diverse forms, but it appears rather as a philosophical doctrine brought out to explain the operation of the universe than as a popularbelief. The Vedic view is clearlyfar other than this : the great majorityof men believed themselves to be good and destined to the joys of heaven, but they did not regardthese joys as making earth less desirable. The normal attitude of the whole of the Vedic religion, down to the very end of the periodof the Brahmanas, is that it is a good thingto behold the light of the sun, and to live a hundred years, for which prayers and spells alike are earnestly resorted to, and that, at the end of the life one attains, there will be another, if different yet analogous,life in the world to comewith the same pleasuresas on earth, but without the disadvantagesof human

imperfection. 

As compared with the clear conceptionof the dwelling of the spirit in the highest heaven or in hell, there is little trace in the Vedic literature of the moresimple and perhaps more primitive conception9 which regards the dead as dwelling in the earth, whether actually in the place of burial, or in the under

world. The idea that the dead man's spirit went to the sky is not in the slightest degree essentially bound up with the burning by fire, for the Rig veda 1expressly places both the Fathers, who have been burnt, and those whohave not been burnt, as dwelling in the heaven, and there is no hint of anycontrary view in Vedic literature. But undoubtedly here and there the idea is to be seen that the burning by the fires was the moment of the passage of the soul to the sky : of this the best proofis the doctrine of &valayana2 that the place attained by the spirit depends on the nature of the fire, which first seizes the corpse when the body is set on the bier within the reach of fires derived from the sacred three fires. But this example in itself is not in the slightest degree a proof that it was the fire which sent the spirit to heaven : it is only a natural, but not primitive, view, as is shown by the mere fact that it dependson the use of the three fires, which the average householder could not dream of maintaining. The real view was doubtless less complicated, and in the samepassage Avalayana presents us with a different idea : a pit, knee deep, is to be dug north-east of the Ahavanlya fire, a water plant, ipala,is put there, andwith the smoke the soul thence goes to the heaven. This latter view, whichlooks at the earth as the place of the dead, is also supported by various other considerations. When a man is near to death, a spellis used to bring him fromthe lower to the upper earth to the protectionof Aditi, sun and moon.3 Whena pit is dug, as often in the ritual, it is called the placeof the Fathers ; whatis dug down has the Fathers as its deity ;4 Yama 5 even is lord of the earth ; the darkness of the abode of the dead is referred to in passages where we cannot see any reference to the punishments of hell ;6 a spell of the Atharvaveda7 seeks to send his enemy to the placeof Yama ; the dead are mentioned as living at the roots of the plants ; the dead man in the funeral ritual is spokenof as being laid to rest in mother earth, which is to be kind to him. Thepath of the gods is often distinguished from the path of the Fathers,8 the presence of the dogs9 on the way shows that the road was a special one, andnot the peaceful path of the gods ; the door of the heaven is in the north-east, that of the world of the Fathers in the south-east,10 a conception which is clearly due in part at least to oppositionto the world of the gods : the relation of the south to the Fathers may be due to the factll that on the shortest day, the time of the spirits par excellence, the sun is at the furthest south point in his course. The path too appearsto be a different one from that of the gods since it is described as pravat, which may denote either a downward path as of a stream, or, at any rate, a path forward to the horizon, rather than one rising erect to the heaven.12 But, if any doubt existed as to the connexion of the

spirits with the earth, it would be removed by the descriptions of the ritual of the dead, which, though not given in detail in the Brahmanas, are set out at length in the Sutras, and must be of great antiquityin their essence.1 Thegifts for the souls are not sent to them by fire to be conveyed to the sky : they are often laid in pits on the earth or upon the earth, in the neighbourhood of human dwellings which spiritsall the world over are ever supposedto haunt : they come to the meal, and sit on the place made readyfor them, or they find their way into the water-bottle :2 they take out the heat of the food, and leave only the outer substance.8 At the end of the meal they are sent away, politely indeed, with the words,4 The Fathers have satisfied themselves ', or, as at the Anthesteria in Athens, more directly with, 1Depart, ye Fathers, Soma-loving, on your ancient deep paths ; but return a month later to our house to eat the offering, with wealth in offspring, in heroes.' 4 The shaking out of the garment of the offerer is another proof of the anxiety to be rid of the ghostly guests.6 But it must not for a moment be supposedthat the belief in the presenceof the spirits on earth on such occasions was incompatible with the belief in their dwellingin the sky: the two beliefs are inextricably confused in the human mindat the present day, and have been so confused for centuries, probably for thousands of years. 

It is perfectly in keeping with the multitude of ideas regardingthe nature of the future of the dead which must be produced by our total ignoranceof its character, that the idea should be found that the newly departeddoes not at once join the congregationof the other ancient dead.6 In the first period, often for a year after death, the monthly raddha offerings are not paidto the newly dead in the usual form of offerings to father, grandfather, and great grandfather : he is offered a separate offering: in this he is not invoked to come, doubtless because he is near at hand ; he is not dismissed, but merely bidden be at peace ; in placeof the prayerthat the gifts to the Fathers may be theirs for ever, it is merelyasked that they may be presentfor the dead : the innovation of some schools in which the offerings to the Fathers were supplemented by one to the All-gods, a clear proofthat the assimilation of Fathers and gods was in progress,7 is omitted in the case of the offering to one who has just died. The distinction is made in the later literature and can

perhaps be traced right back to fankhayanal by which the recently dead is a Pr^ta,&departed'spirit, and is distinguished from the Fathers, Pitaras, par excellency. It is, however, clear that the view is not that of the Rigveda,8 where it is obviously contemplated that the souls join at once the ancient Fathers, but it is not necessary to regard it as a later innovation : it is one of these divergent views, which may be regarded as a sort of compromise between the idea of the soul in heaven and the soul in earth, but which need not have been later than the developed view of the soul as in heaven and which also need not have been ever generally accepted.It must, further, be rememberedthat the belief in the departure of the soul to the sky cannot be proved to be later than the belief in the soul remaining near the body. But it is natural to assume that in the earliest view the latter was the attitude of mind adopted, before the clear separation of mind and body produced the idea that the mindhad no need to remain with the body,3 and that the soul, at first held to abide on earth near or with the body, was gradually conceived as goingto the gods in the highest sky, while the older view lived on, combining in various ways with the new. 

It is probable that in the Indo-Iranian period there had already developed the conception of the distinction between the heavenly lot of the blessed dead and the dismal fate in hell of the evil. There is less ground for supposingthat such beliefs go back to the Indo-European period ;4 then it may be that the only idea of the fate of the dead was that of a continued existence in a shadowyand imperfect condition, best representedto us by the Hades of Homer. Ofthis there may be seen traces in the Vedic conception of the future of the dead ; it is interesting that the vision of Bhrgu presents us with somethingof this kind, though evil-doers suffer there, as do even in the Greek Hades certain criminals of conspicuous demerit. As it stands, however, the account is not early, since Varuna's heaven appears to be located in the same region as that of the shades,5 

With the conceptionof the removal of the spirit to a greater distance is often conjoined with primitive peoples the idea of the final burial of the body which has been provisionallyburied. In the Vedic funeral ritual there are different stages of the processof disposal of the dead to be noted, but the ritual does not reveal, as we have it, any trace of this conception of the removal of the Preta to the sphereof the Fathers as connected with the

different progress of the burial rites. If the connexion existed, as it may well have done, it is not proved for India by the available authorities. Even, however, as a Preta there is extremelylittle trace of the belief of the soul as a ghost which comes to visit men. It is possible, as we have seen, that dreams of the dead were ascribed to visits of their ghosts, though this is not directly recorded ; the Rigvedaxexpressly refers to Fathers who sit in the regions of earth or in the dwellings of men ; the Taittirlya Samhitaa declares that the man who draws blood from a Brahman must fail to attain the world of the Fathers for as many years as the blood wets grains of sand. It seems possible that in the case of a dead man, whose soul is to live in the world of earth, because the southern fire first reaches his body, the soul is regardedas remaining away from the world of the Fathers in heaven ; reference is madein that view also to the Fathers, who live in the air, and whom we mayimagine as ghosts there, but too much faith may not be placed in this concep tion.8 We hear of the appearance of Uccai9ravas Kaupayeya to instruct his nephew on a mystery of the Saman.4 But the normal view is that men andthe Fathers do not appear together,6 and the Vedic literature hardly shows a trace of the belief in ghosts which abounds in the Buddhist : the idea that evil spirits are caused by men needing proper burial, which is common in modern India, and that ghostsexist everywhere and send disease, is one whichis not to be found in the Atharvaveda, which in its innumerable references to demons, Raksases, Pi^acas, and others, deals with them in such manner as to Show that the belief that many of them were merely hostile spirits of the dead was not a living one.6 The Buddhist view, on the contrary, deals solemnly ^th rfiosts :7 it treats the stealing of their property on the same footingas Stealing the property of beasts, it providesfor cases of sexual intercourse with such ghosts ; ghosts abide in the lonely woods, on the banks of rivers, in a sugar field . They are often at the cross-roads and they crowd into their old homejnt eager search for kind friends to give them a little food. But in the mainit is clear the ghostsare not normal things: it is not a case of simple belief in the constant presence of the dead among the living which the atapatha Brahmana denies.8 They are guiltysouls suffering punishment, naked or covered barely by their hair, without protection against the heat, which fills them, from water, shade, or wind, hungry and thirsty, for the water even of the Ganges turns to blood in their mouths. A city of ghosts is recorded by the Divyavadana 9 of the Buddhists, an island inhabited by ghosts in a Jataka,10 and the classical Sanskrit literature contains striking pictures of the ghosts which throng the places of sepulture of the dead. But how far these views

were held in the Vedic periodit is impossibleto say :1 there is no reasonable doubt that some of the Buddhist ghostsare transmutations of tree and water spirits due to the growing animism which treated the spirit as merely living in, and not having its life in, the tree or the waters. But it is worth noting that in many cases the Buddhist ghosts are to die and goto hell in a certain 

period :2 it is natural to see in this the record of the condition before final damnation of the Preta. 

3. The Transmutation ofthe Dead 

The Rigveda and the Vedic literature of the periodof the Samhitas andthe Brahmarias presents us with no clear proofof the belief in the transmigra tion of the dead : the scanty evidence which has been adduced to provethe contrary view will be discussed hereafter,8 but in this placeit is important to note certain really popular beliefs of which there are traces in that literature and in that of the Sutras. The most important pieceof evidence is late : it is recorded by Baudhayana4 that the birds at the offering to the dead should receive lumps of food, just like the Fathers, on the ground that in the form of birds the Fathers go about. It must, however, be admitted that this is not enough to prove a real popular belief. The idea of the incarnation of men as snakes is clearly to be acceptedfor the later period,6 but for the actual Vedic period it is not demonstrated, and it must in all likelihood be deemed to be anidea which entered the religion of the Veda with the advance of aboriginal influences. A more interesting case is recorded in the ritual for the final burial of the bones of the dead ;6 if they cannot be found, then a garmentis spread out, and, if a beast alights on it, it is treated as representing the bones of the dead. But this usage which is recorded for us at a late period cannot be pressed very far. To this scanty evidence may be added such support as can be ob tained from such stories as that7 of a mother, who, dying in the absence of her son, lies in wait for him in the shapeof a newly created jackalto warn himof danger. The proof does not come to much, and none of it is of early date. 

Of the soul becoming a plant or passing into a plant we have no early evidence save such as may be derived from the solitary address to the deadman in the Rigveda8 which tells him to go to the plants with his members, andthe isolated statement that the Fathers lie about the roots of the plants.9

416 The Spirits of the Dead [Part IV  

There is much evidence of connexion with stars. This, however, is verydifferent from a normal transmigration : it obviously is connected with the belief in the departureof the souls to the regions of heaven, and on the philo sophical side it appearsas the doctrine of the identity of the soul with Aditya.1 The epic notoriously is fond of seeing the souls of the great heroes and priests of the past in the constellations of the heavens. The atapatha Brahmana 2 calls the stars women and the light of those who by their good works havereached the heaven. The same view is found in the Sutra of Apastamba.8 It is possible also that the same idea may be referred to in the Rigveda* in the reference to the seers who watch the sun, or those who stand high in heaventhrough the giving of plenteous largesse to the priest.6 Perhaps too the nameof the Great Bear as the Seven Seers,6 of one of the Pleiades as Arundhatl, and even the view of the Krttikas as wives of the Bears, may be traced to this idea. The view that the moon is the abode of the souls is found also in the later period, but there is no identification with the moon, but merely by a transfer of ideas the change of the resting-place of the souls.7 1 TB. iii. 10. 9. 11 ; fB. ii. 6. 4. 8 ff. 12 ; HGS. i. 12. 14 ff. ; cf.

CHAPTER 24   

THE DISPOSAL OF THE DEAD 

THEHE is nothing in Vedic literature to encourage the view, which has beenso energetically contended for in connexion with western civilization, that the custom of burning the dead is one which denotes an essential distinction of race, as contrasted with the practice of burying the dead.1 The burning of the deadis set over against the burying of the dead in the Rigveda2 merely as twolegitimate alternative methods, and this is the state of affairs throughout the history of India. Burning is normally preferred, the chief exceptions being very holy ascetics and infants under two years of age,3 but the existence of burial cannot be denied for any period. Moreover it is important to note that the double practice of burial or burning is recorded of many other objects which it is desired to dispose of, owing to their dangerous character. Nor is it to be doubted 4 that the primitive use of fire in this case was that of removingthe dread substance, which burial could also effect. The idea that burning wasnecessary to take the soul to heaven is not Vedic : the Rigveda provesthat from the earliest recorded period the unburnt dead went to heaven no less than the burnt. 

Other modes of disposal of the dead are referred to in the Rigveda5 andthe Atharvaveda.6 The dead might be cast away (paroptdh), or they mightbe exposed (uddhitdh). The latter expression seems to mean exposed ontrees, a practice which was known in later India, and which is referred to in the atapatha Brahmana,7 being prescribed as the expiation, in the case in which a cow is slaughtered and found to be in calf, as regards the disposal

of the embryo. But these ideas are of no importancefor Vedic India in general ; the rite of burning is the rite which has won approvalin the Sutras, and that of burying the body is there severely restricted. 

It is, however, a very different question whether this positionis primitive. In one of the funeral hymns in the Rigveda* the dead is told to go to motherearth, which is to enclose him, as with a garment a mother her child. It is the view of the ritual texts that these words applyto the later rite by which the burnt bones of the dead are placed in an urn in earth, but the inter pretation, though defended by Oldenberg,8 cannot be treated as natural, andwe must admit that it is only reasonable to assume that it is meant for anactual burial. The later ritual which had in the main given up burial for burning naturally had to use the verses somewhere, and the burial of the bones gave an excellent opportunityfor this action, but the fact remains that the verses are burial verses, that the Rigveda treats burial and burning as onthe same footing, and that it probably represents contemporary fact.8 

The details of the burning alone can be reconstructed with certainty, but many of them must be assumed to have applied equallyto burial.4 In the moment of death the man was laid on the ground, which is smeared with cow dung and strewn with grass, near his sacred fire. The dead then was washedand anointed : the hair, the beard, and the nails were closely trimmed : a garland and fresh garmentwere laid upon him. The women of the house5 wailed around the place on which he was laid, tearing or loosening their hair, like the mourners at a Roman funeral, smiting their breasts and thighs. The body was borne to the grave or taken there on a car : the tracks of the party rather than of the dead were wiped out by means of a bundle of twigs attached to the dead, so as to preventthe recurrence of the spirit of the dead. The mourners accompanied the bier with loosened hair. Perhaps as the procession moved along were repeatedverses6urging the dead to go on his long way, to unite with the Fathers and with Yama, to leave sin behind, to go home, and to escape the dogs of Yama, while evil spirits were banned. The dead was then laid on the funeral pyre,in the midst of three fires produced by manipulation from the three sacred fires maintained by him, if he did so maintain them. Then the wife of the dead man is placedbeside him, but

It is clear that the husband's brother or some other a pupil or aged servant, according to Asvalayana must be meant who takes her in wedlock.8 The bow 4is takenfrom the hand of the dead if a Ksatriya in the case of a Brahman5 a staff, of a Vai$ya an ox-goad, according to the later ritual with a verse saying that it is taken for attainment of lordly power and strength: the later ritual,6 however, breaks the bow and leaves it with the dead, as the soldiers of Brennuswhen they died had their swords broken and laid by them to deceive the learned Polybios and the modern world for two thousand years.7 Further, in the ritual the offering utensils of the dead are placed on the bier with him, only the stone, metal, or earthen being kept back and given to a Brahman,a practice disapproved by some, or thrown into water, or kept by the son of the dead.8 This usage is apparently to be seen in the Rigveda9 as applied to a Soma vessel at least.   

The Rigveda 10expressly refers to the burning of a goat which is the share of Agni, and to the use of the flesh of a cow to protect the body against the flame. In the ritual texts details of the use of the flesh of the cow are given : the omcntum is placed over the face, the kidneys in either hand, to satisfy the dogs of Yama like the honey cake for Kerberos and the skin is put over the whole. A goat is also tied to the pyre so loosely that it can

easily break the cord. The pyre is then lighted or the three fires are directed towards it, and Agni is invoked to take the dead uninjured to the Fathers. Other prayers and offerings seem to have been addressed to Yama, the Aiigirases, and SarasvatI ;n the sense of the ceremony is shown by the words

of the prayer, not recorded in the Rigveda,12 * From him thou art born ; mayhe in turn be born from thcc.'

libations of water for the dead : they change their garments: they pass under a yoke l of branches of the purifying Parna tree, they touch on entering the house purifying things, water, fire, dung, mustard grains, and barley 

grains, the powerof which lies in the name Yava, which is constantly con nected in the Vedic mind with yu,'restrain'(demons). Perhaps,8too, at this point, and not merely at the putting away of the bones, there takes place the ceremony of removing from the house, and placingin a desolate place, the fire which must not go through the door. It is impossible to believe that this fire was really in the view of the Rigveda kept for the making of offerings to the dead, though the exact meaning of the references to it in the Rigvedais hard to ascertain.8 Moreover, until the bones are collected, or for three or ten days, the relatives must observe certain restrictions : they must not use their ordinary beds, but sleep on the ground, must observe chastity, cook nofood, and live on what they buy, or what others giveto them. The nature of these observances is obvious : it is in some way to avoid the risk which death has brought into the vicinity of the relatives : the view that the Preta of the dead is near at hand is clear. The prohibitionof cookingis attested by the Avesta also : after death the relatives should cook nothing for three days, and the Parsis observe this rule to the present day.4Clearly the death has infected the food and the vicinityin which it was, and to eat it will bring injury. The sleeping on the ground is less easy to explain: it is possibly aneffort to avoid the attention of the spiritif it returns : possiblyit may be traced to the view that the relative, by contact with the dead, has con taminated himself and must be purified, before the bed can be safely approached, if it is not to be infected for all time to come : or communionwith the earth may be desired. The abstinence from intercourse may be explained, as it is explained by Oldenberg,6as due to the danger that injury might thus be done to any child which might perchance be born. 

The third or tenth day is that of the collecting of the bones of the dead.6 In the first instance the placeof burningis cooled by the use of cooling sub stances, water plants, one Kiyambu with the very name suggesting water, andthe inevitable frog.7 Water and milk are prescribedfor the besprinklingof the place of the fire in the later ritual, which also providesfor the offering of water and milk for the dead on the night after the death.8 According to

icvalayana,1 who places the rite on the tenth day after death, the bones should be put, those of a man in a male urn and those of a woman in a female urn respectively, the reference being to marks on the urns which are treated as like the breasts of a woman.2 The bones should be picked up by aged 

persons, in uneven numbers, not men and women together, with the thumband the fourth finger and deposited without noise, those of the feet comingfirst, those of the head last. Then the bones are purified with a sieve, and the urn is placed in a pit where waters do not run together from every side, save fain water ; earth is put down upon the urn, and it is covered with a lid. Theperformers then go away, not turning back, purify themselves, and offer a 

raddha to the dead. According to the Kau9ika Sutra,8 a different procedure is adopted, in so far that the bones are depositedat the root of a tree, with a verse of the Atharvaveda,4 which beseeches the greattree not to press heavily on them ; but it is by no means clear that this is the original sense of the Atharvan verse, which may refer to properburial. 

A still further rite is prescribed by the fatapatha Brahmaria6 and men tioned in other texts, the raising of a memorial to the dead. This is to be donea long time after the death ; when even the year is forgotten is a suitable time. The bones are ^alln-ml from the hole in the earth or from the tree roots, in which case a verse6 is used which rather points to the idea of real burial, and may suggest that once the gatheringof the bones and the putting awayof them in a relic mound were done when the body had decayed after normalburial. If the bones cannot be found, the rite alluded to above takes place:7 a garment is spread on the water's edge : the dead is called by name, andany beast 8 that alightsis treated as representing the bones : in the alterna tive, dust from the placeis used. The night is spentin ceremonies : womenbeating their thighs with the right hand,9 with hair loosened, wailing,thrice in the course of the night dance thrice round the bones. Lutes are played, and

doubtless to scare away spirits a noise made by the beatingof an old shoe on an empty pot or in other ways.10 In the morning the bones are taken to the new place of rest, which must be out of sight from the village, in a place where there is abundance of plants, around whose roots the Fathers are said

to creep,1 but no thorns. A hole is made or furrow ploughed : seeds of all sorts are sowed and the bones deposited. The hole is then covered over with stones and earth to make a memorial mound : in it seeds are sown to feed the dead,8 and pits are dug in it into which water and milk are poured to please the dead.* 

The departure from the place of the erection of the memorial is followed bymany rites to prevent contamination, the use of fire, of the Apamarga plant, the obliteration of the footsteps, the crossing of pitsfilled with water, andso on. The placingof a barrier of some sort between the dead and the living is a rite recorded in the Rigveda*itself, whether the objectis stone or somepiece of earth. 

The nature of the mode of disposal of the dead probably showed itself specially valuable in the Indian climate, but apart from this consideration, the influence of the practice of removing evil influences by burning, and of the worship of the fire, and the use of fire as the messenger between men and the gods, must have aided the development of the use of cremation as almost the normal and certainly much the most usual form of disposing of the dead. The belief in the burning of the dead as a suitable mode of disposal may be Indo-European,6 the evidence for this is merely the practice in early Greece and Germany also but it may equally have been produced in India, perhaps at first under the influence of the needs of war, where the burial of the dead leaves them exposed to misusage by the enemy. It may be that the belief in burning is older than the belief in the heavenly abode, but that is not sus ceptible of proof ; the fact that the Rigveda does not require burningin order that the dead may go to heaven may best be explained on the groundthat the belief is older than burning of the dead, rather than that it developed andbecame independent of that burning. Naturally, however, in any case the burning of the dead was regarded as helping the path to the sky, and fromanother point of view here and there the idea presentsitself that the dead manis in a sense6 an offering to the gods. Such an idea, however, never became of importance, to judge from its rare appearance, and from the fact that the burning of the dead was never decked out with the apparatusof the sacrifice. 1 CB. xiii. 8, 1. 20. and Roth (JAOS. xvi. p. ccxliii) 8 As at the piling of the fire, Weber, Ind. finds the name in JUB. i. 25. 8.

Chap. 24] The Disposal of the Dead 423  

The exact idea connected with the burning seems to have been that the whole self was burned, soul as well as body, in order to convey it, in a refined form but still unaltered in essence, to the regions of heaven. It is clear fromwhat has been already said that there is no question of the mere sending thither of the soul in the Vedic religion: in the philosophy different ideas appear, but not in the religiousfaith. Nevertheless at the same time the manis still regarded as beingin some measure present in the bones which are left :* even if, as is probable, the original force of the verses of the Rigveda and the Atharvaveda, which refer to burial, dealt with real burial, yet when they wereadopted for burial of the bones, they must have been felt not to run counter to popular belief. 

In the Vedic belief the popular view that the dead must be provided withthe same things2 as they enjoyed in the world of men has been greatly attenuated. It is absurd to suppose that all women were ever burned with thejlead :3 the practice never existed in India at any time which is recorded, and in many cases the result would have been to leave children without proper care. But it is perfectlyclear that the wife of a great man might beburned with him, and that the Rigveda* shows a stage of opinionin whichthis rite has been definitely abolished by the Brahmans, and has been replaced by the giving of her to the brother or some other relative of the dead in sym bolic, if not necessarily always real, marriage : we may well believe that the marriage might be real only if the dead had left no son alive to perform for him the funeral ceremonies. Similarly the dead was deprived not merely of his bow, but also of a pieceof gold, which his eldest son received : it is difficult not to believe that the older practice was as in ancient Greece to allow himto bear with him to his future abode the ornament of gold which he worein his life on earth.5 The practice of envelopingthe body of the dead in the limbs of the cow is a curious one, and offers possibilities of different explana tions. But it is clearly the view of the Rigveda that the heat of the fire is to exhaust its fury on the members of the goat and presumably also of the cow,6 and it may be that the offering was a sort of substitution for the dead himself, so that evil powers might assail it in placeof him. The goatstands in another category : it may be compared to the goat which is slain with the sacrificial horse to show it the way : in the passageto the next

world the journey may be trackless and the sure-footed goat will find the way.1 

In addition to the normal rites special forms2 are prescribed for many cases, such as the death of an Agnihotrin, of a pregnant woman after the saving of the embryo, and a Brahman who has acquired knowledge of the Brahman, the rite in his case being the Brahmamedha.8 In the case of death in absence the body may be preserved in oil or only the bones brought back for the formal rites. When a man is believed dead the cremation of a figure representing him is allowed, and, if after such a rite has been performed he should return alive, he is subjected to the same form of ritual as a newly born child, including remarriage to his wife.4 The modern practice by which in the burial of anascetic his skull is broken open with a coconut to allow the escape of the spirit, though based on a doctrine of the Upanisads5 as to the departure of the soul through the skull on death, is not recorded in any early Vedic text. Though children under two were usually buried or thrown away, they mightbe cremated if their teeth had grown ;6 burial in the house which is elsewhere often recorded perhaps as a mode of securing rebirth in the mother is unknown.

THE CULT OF THE DEAD 

1. The Living and the Dead 

THE attitude of the Vedic Indian to his dead is one of distinctive andpronounced individuality. The constant anxiety lest from the dead should come injury to the livingis perfectly obvious, but it must be admitted that it does not show any trace of being due to the direct fear of the spirit of the dead : it is the fear of death which marks the attitude of the Indian : the deadhas not a hostile nature, but the thing which has affected him is to be feared. \Jtis, therefore, intelligible that the Indian in the Vedic period looks, despite his dread of death, with affection and esteem upon his ancestors, and that much of his existence should be concerned with the means of securing themnourishment.1 That food is required especially on certain occasions, not less often than once a month and occasionally at other times : in a certain portion of the rainy season the dead are conceived as leaving the abode of heaven and coming to the houses of their kin to seek for food.2 On the other hand if the men care for their Fathers, it is but natural that these Fathers should be deemed to be anxious to aid and assist them, and the companion ship of the blessed dead with the gods encourages the belief that they havepower to aid, even as the gods have power.8 The Fathers generally are often referred to in the Rigveda and the later literature as invoked to confer boons, similar to those which the gods convey, and, though they are distinctly differentiated by a multitude of things, and especially by cult, from the powers of heaven, nevertheless, for the purpose of being a very present help in tribulation, they appear to be ranked as not unworthy of invocation with, or even without, the gods. Like the gods, men pray to them for success, for the defeat of enemies, for the gift of rain, for the bestowal of eloquence, or for abundance of food. Even in battle the Fathers are invoked as warriors.4 But the energy of the Fathers has one special end, the productionof off spring, in which they have the special interest that the rites for the dead can only be kept up by the device of continuing the family. At the offering for the

dead the great-grandfather, the grandfather, and the father are all invoked to send sons :l the wife of the offerer is given a lump of the food made ready for the Fathers with the prater that they may accord her a son ;2 the offerer8 himself, who desires a son, wets his face with the remains of the water poured out for the Fathers. They naturallyfind a placein the ritual for the marriage ceremony : food is offered to them before the marriageto induce them to give offspring to the bride, and, when the bridal processionstarts out, it is thought that the Fathers crowd around to see the bride.4 But we do not hear in anycase that the Fathers were deemed to incorporate themselves in the bride for rebirth, as is one constant view of birth in Australian belief, and as seems in some degree to have been the view taken of the Roman Genius.5 

In the overwhelming majority of cases the person invoked is not an indivi dual, but the whole body of the Fathers as such : nevertheless in occasional instances an individual ancestor may be invoked, like Kanva or Kakslvant, or a specific group such as the Vasisthas.6 Men too occasionally appear among the gods with divine attributes, such as Kutsa who is invoked along with Indra.7 Other men may here and there be placed in this position: the name, Udalakagyapa,of a spirit invoked at the plough festival, does not look very divine or demoniac, but that is a mere speculation.8 

The attitude of the Fathers to the livingis assumed by the latter to be oneof friendship : they are invoked to turn the merit acquired by their good deeds to the overthrow of the foe of the living, but to their own they are dangerous 

only when these sin against them by failing to provide them with due offerings, a fact which seems clearly alluded to as early as the Rigyeda.9 Their powerto injure is pre-supposed by the help they are to givein the overthrow of enemies, but very little is said directly about it. In a spell against the Dasyus, who at the offering for the dead mix themselves with the Fathers looking like kinsmen, a torch is employed, but this is hardly any definite evidence that the Fathers per se were dangerous.10 Nor is the mere fact that various objects 

are buried at cross-roads for the destruction of enemies uany proofof their activity in effecting the desired destruction, since many other evil spirits inhabit cross-roads. The souls of unborn children become accordingto a late piece of evidence blood suckers,12 and possiblythis may explain the special 1Kau9. Ixxxviii. 28. Veda\ p. 565, n. 1.

objection felt in Vedic religion to the slayer of an embryo, but this explanation is not necessary. The danger from the dead is, as we have seen, fear of death, not of the spirits of the Fathers. Moreover, as we have noted, the Atharva veda finds for the evils which are practised on men the cause in demons,1 not in souls of the dead, which is again a strong piece of evidence that the mischievous powers of the dead were not strongly felt in the Vedic period. 

As we have seen, ghosts appear very little in the Vedic literature, andsimilarly the presenceof the dead on earth to aid their offspringis practically unknown in Indian literature before the Buddhist era.2 

2. The Offerings to the Dead in the Domestic Ritual 

Beside the regular offerings which are prescribedfor the Fathers, there are others which are to be performed on special occasions, such as the birth of ason, a marriage, and the givingof the name to the child.3 In this case the offering or4raddha', which bears its name4 of that which is connected with 

raddha,*faith ', from the fact that the presents to the Brahmans whichaccompany the offerings to the dead reveal the faith of the offerer in the Brahmans, is to be performed on the waxing half of the month, and before midday : the number of Brahmans chosen is even, not as usual odd : the performances are from left to right, not vice versa ; barley replaces sesame ; the milk meal lumps are mixed with sour milk and roasted grains, and the Fathers are addressed as Nandmiukha,'joyful in countenance ',5 in place of' with tearful countenance ', which is elsewhere not rarely used. Theserank as the Vrddhi Qraddhas, and similar to them are Purta Qraddhas, at the dedication of wells, pools, and so on. 

Much more important are the regular monthly raddhas6performed on the day of new moon, month by month, and after midday. The important part of the rite is the choice of Brahmans to represent the Fathers, at least three, but often more, and on no account one only at least at the first raddha offered. Moreover, by some authorities, further Brahmans are requiredto represent the All-gods. Three vessels of metal, stone, and clay are employed : into each water is poured, and in the view of Qaunaka7 the first vessel is not touched for the whole of the ceremony, as the Fathers would be presentin it. Sesameis also put into the vessels. Then the water is offered as Arghya water to the Brahmans, and they are also given garlands, incense, lights, perfumes, andclothes. With the remains of the water the offerer wipeshis face, if he

desires a son. Then he asks their permissionto offer lumps of food in the fire, and does so or placesit in their hands : they are also given other food, whichthey eat, and the ceremony finishes when they are satisfied. 

Distinct from the monthly Parvaija r&ddha seems to have been another offering, the Masika,1 monthly brought on the waning half of the month onan uneven day. The rites for this day are varyingly given, and in some cases the rite seems to have been assimilated to the Astaka rites. For it Hirapya ke$in2lays down the rule that the sacrificer up to the ageof fifty should offer to the Fathers the seam of his garment, and that otherwise he should offer hair. The first idea is clearly that the dead need garments: the second seems less obvious, and it is possible that it is due to the very different idea of substitution, which becomes the more necessary, since at fifty one is approach ing the age when death is claiming a man more and more energetically.8 But other theories are possible ; the giving of hair may be merely a desire for communion, the burial of hair with the dead has been explained byEitrem *as at once due to this desire5 and to the wish to lay apart that whichhas been contaminated by death. 

The Astakas 6 are festivals of special importance and difficulty. The rule of Agvalayana is that there should be four, on the eighth day of the dark half of the month in the two months of each of the two seasons, winter andthe cool season, Margagirsa, Pausa, Magha, and PhSlguna. But the rule is that the number should be three or less. The normal view seems to be that Taisa, Magha, Phalguna are the months, but the three ceremonies can be reduced to three days, the 7th to 9th of one month, or pressedinto the eighth day only. Hiragyakein allows only one festival, the three-day rite of the Ekastaka, the eighth day of the dark half of the month Magha. The deities of the Astakas are a matter of dispute: Agni, Surya, Prajapati, night, the Naksatras, the seasons, and the Fathers have all claims. The nature of the offering is equally disputed: some demand flesh at all three : others cakes at the first, a cow at the second, and vegetables at the third, or the same set butin diverse order. A very odd rite is prescribed by the Manava school,7 for the evening before the last Astaka : at the cross-roads the sacrificer kills a cow, dismembers it, and divides the flesh among the passers-by. The Atakais followed by the Anvastakya, which is allowed to follow all three rites, or the middle one only. The nature of the rite is rather curious : a fire is made,surrounded, and an opening made in the north : an offering strew is laid

down, and food placed on it, various forms of rice with sesame, milk rice, andmixed messes of meat and sour milk, and of meal and honey. Then he offers to Soma with the Fathers and to Agni Kavyavfihana, and thereafter gives to the Fathers in the east, and their wives in the west, shares of all except the honey drink : the Mothers receive also Sura and the scum of boiled rice. The offering is, according to Gobhila, made with much elaboration in pits which are dug for the offerings. Three lumps of food are made, and salve and sesame oil are also givento the Fathers and the Brahmans : the three lumps at the end are putto varied uses : the middle one his wife eats, if she wishes sons : the others are put in the water, or on a fire, or givento a cow or to a Brahman to eat.1 The giving to a cow is of interest as it is also provided as a substitute for the offering of a cow at the appropriate Astaka that a cowshould be given food to eat. It is difficult not to feel that this is a case of a very simple desire to save the life of the cow, and of the parallel desire to secure the favour of the cow. Another mode of evading the offering of a cowat the Astakas was to fire brushwood, an idea which Oldenberg2 has suggested may be regarded as an effort to strengthen the sun at the period of the winter solstice, in which very roughly the Astakas tended to fall. 

There is clear evidence that, in addition to the three or four Astakas, another offering was made in the middle of the rains, perhapsin the month of Prausthapada : it is stated to be intended to be like the Anvastakya offering or the Parvana raddha : there is the same disputeas to the nature of the offering : flesh is necessary if at all possible, but one authority calls it out andout a vegetable Astaka. This provision and the tendency, as we have seen, to make the offerings simpleare due doubtless to the fact that they are obligatory offerings, which could not be omitted and which therefore mustoften be simple.8 

3. The Offeringsto the Dead in the Qrauta Ritual In the rauta ritual a leading placein the cult of the dead is taken by the Pincjapitryaj fia,4 which should be offered after middayof the day of new moon.The sacrifice must take placein the southern fire, which is that appropriateto the Fathers, and the regular procedureof such offeringsis followed : the sacred cord is to be worn over the right shoulder, not the left ; all movementsare from right to left, and recitations and acts take place once, not thrice ; while in the normal offering movements are from south and west to north andeast, in this offering they are in the reverse order, in so far that they must

begin in the north and end in the south. In the libations the hand has the outer part turned downwards, the space between the thumb and the index finger is the space which serves for the passageof the oblations. Water is touched after each naming of the Fathers, and the offerer looks south, not north.11 A pit is dug in the earth, south or west of the southern fire, with aformula to drive away the Asuras and the Raksases, and a firebrand from that fire is used as an additional mode of causing fear. f The offering begins withtwo libations of boiled grain or butter to Soma with the Fathers and to AgniKavyavahana. Then the Fathers are directly approached : at the beginning, middle, and end of the furrow or pit water is poured, and the Fathers are invited to wash themselves.2 Then Darbha grass is strewn in the pit, andfrom the remains of the rice pap and butter are made three lumps of food, or according to some authorities four, which are laid down in the pit on the places on which the water was formerly poured. In each case the Fathers are hailed by name if they are known as the father, grandfather, and great grandfather of the offerer ; if the father of the offerer is still alive, various varieties of procedure are mentioned.3 The Fathers are invited to delight themselves : the offerer turns his back doubtless to avoid too close con tact, not that they may be unencumbered by his presence,4 and remains with averted head, until he is breathless or the food is cold : he then turns round to the lumps, says,' The Fathers have delighted themselves ', and pours water on the lumps, adds salve and some pieces of wool or if over fifty, hair from his arm or breast and invites the Fathers to wash, anoint, and clothe* themselves. He may also smell, if he desires a son, the remains of the pot. The Fathers are then honoured, and the Adhvaryu, looking south-east, andpushing away the lumps, bids them depart, pays reverence to the southern andthe Garhapatya fires, for the removal of all sin against heaven and earth. If the wife of the offerer wishes a son, then she eats the middle lump as in the domestic ritual : the other two may be thrown into fire or water, or eaten by

prescribed persons.

which takes place on the afternoon of the second day of the Sakamedhas,the third of the four-month offerings.1 The recipients of offerings are the Fathers with Soma, or Soma with the Fathers, the Fathers who sit on the strew, and the Fathers burned by Agni, while some add Yama with or withoutthe Angirases. The offerings to the three sets of Fathers are a cake, grains, and the offering of meal pap mixed in the milk of the cow, which has lost its own calf, and which has been given another to bring up. The sacrifice is conducted within a hut erected south of the southern fire, in which is made analtar with its orientation based on the intermediate points, on which the southern fire is placed. The technical terms of the offering for the Fathers om svadha, astu svadhd, svadhd namah, replace those used for the gods. Anoffering for Kavyavahana is substituted for the usual Svis^akrt offering at the end of a sacrifice. Washing water is poured out for the Fathers, and lumps are placed at the south-east and west corners of the altar, but the names, not of the latest but of the more distant Fathers, are uttered, the sixth, fifth, andfourth respectively. On the northern side the offerer wipes his hands and says, 4Here, O Fathers, do ye delight yourselves ', and then all leave the hut, placing the sacred cord over the left shoulder, and adore the Ahavanlya fire, and then the Garhapatya. They then return to the hut, altering the position of their cords : the offerer declares that the Fathers have delighted them selves and offers them reverence in the shape of six payings of homage. 

The similarity of the domestic and the rauta ritual in the case of the offerings to the dead is most marked, indeed more clearly so than in the case of the offerings to the gods, where the presenceof the three fires led the Brahmans to constant elaboration of the rites in which they were interested, 

until they bore but faint similarity to the rites of the householder. In the case of the offerings to the dead, however, the southern fire is the only fire of con sequence : the performancesof the sacrificer and the priest in the other fires are purely formal, mainly devices to give them something to do, when the Fathers were presumed in spiritual presence to be eating the offerings fromwhich, it is clear, they were deemed to extract the vital heat. 

The very clear differences between the form of the worship of the gods andthe reverence paid to the dead2 indicate beyond possibility of doubt that the attitude of the living to the dead differed in a marked degree from their attitude towards the gods, a fact which, so far as it goes,is doubtless evidence against the view that the worship of the gods sprang from the worship of 

men who had died. It is clear, however, that before the periodof the Rigvedathe tendance of the dead, the givingof gifts to them to use in the life to come, had developed so as to present the definite view that the dead were possessed

of great powers, and were in many respects as important to their descendants from the point of view of conferring boons as the gods themselves. It is a question of great interest, but one which is insoluble by any evidence available, whether we are to assume that in the Indo-European period the conception of the divine dead had been developed : there is no evidence of anyvalue to show that it had : we may safely assume that, as even in palaeolithic times in Europe, the dead were buried with due honour and gifts made to them, but the development of divinity may lie within the period of development of the several nations.1

PART V. THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE VEDA  

CHAPTER 26 

THE BEGINNINGS OF VEDIC PHILOSOPHY 

THE earliest poetry of India already contains many traces of the essential character of the philosophy of India. In nothing indeed does the continuity of Indian life show itself more strikingly than this : the gods of India change, but the alteration of the higher thought is far less marked. 

Philosophy in India shows its beginnings as often in the expression of scepticism : the normal belief in the gods here and there seems to have beenquestioned, and it is not unnatural that the questioning should have arisen in the case of the most human of the gods, him whom the seers most closely fashioned in their own likeness, the vehement Indra. We have not indeed anycertain case of a seer who himself doubted the truth of Indra's greatness :* no open attack on the god would, we may be sure, have been allowed to comedown to us in the Samhita. But we are distinctly told that there were menwho asked,' Who is Indra, who ever saw him ?'or asserted that he did not exist at all. 2 There were, we learn, faithless men, who did not believe in the gods of the Brahmans and did not perhaps a worse thing give the priests their fees for sacrifice, men who did not believe in Indra, anindrah. Thepious poets denounce these men and assert in opposition the truth3 of the greatness of the god, but it is improbable that their hymns had the effect of convincing the impious. 

It might, however, have been expected that in the moral law of Varuna, which is the counterpart of the physical law recognized by the religion of the Veda as prevailing in the universe, the Rta, and in Varuna himself as thegreat guardian of that law, there might have been found a deityin whom the mind of the sceptic might find peace and satisfaction. The case of Iran proves that the nature of the great Asura could easily give rise to the conception of a moral ruler and a deep ethical view of the world. But, whatever the cause,

Phil. i. 87 f.) finds iii.4.4; v. 52. 15), but this is untenable, in RV. viii. 90. 13-15 traces of conflict especially as actual references to idols between Indra and Krsna, the proto- (PCS. iii. 14.8)orCaityas(AGS.i. 12. 1) type of the god of the Glta. are found only at the very close of the

434 The Philosophy of the Veda [Partv   

it is beyond possibility of doubt that in India from the first philosophy is intellectual, not moral, in interest and outlook. The conception of Varuiia, which reaches a high level and is majestic enough both in its cosmical andmoral aspect, has attained by the time of the Rigveda its highest develop ment : it falls rapidly into unimportance, until the Brahmana*can assert that an ugly deformed man, who is used as a scapegoatat the final bath of the horse sacrifice, is said to be a symbol of Varuna. With this decline of the great and noble god goes hand in hand the decline of the interest of Indian philosophy or religion in morality as such : numerous as are the moral pre cepts which can be found here and there in Vedic literature, it must beadmitted that it is quite impossibleto find any real or vital principle of ethics. 

The tendency to treat Indra as a doubtful personality is paralleled by the somewhat cynical tone which is certainly shown in speaking of him here andthere. In one hymn2 a number of human occupations and desires is men tioned and the refrain is' O Soma, flow for Indra': the humorous tone of the poem seems obvious, and the refrain alone may have preservedit from oblivion. Another hymn8 in which Indra expresseshis feelings of exhilara tion, as the result of the Soma drink, may be considered to be the natural expression of the poet's mind, in describing the splendidresults of the glorious drink ; it seems to be very doubtful whether the assumption of covert satire is not more natural and probable. The famous frog hymn4 also presents difficulties ; it would be wrong to deny that it is intended as a rain spell,5 butthere is improbabilityin the attempt to deny that there is some humourintended in the comparison of the frogs to priests: the idea that the hymnis a mere satire on the Brahmans will not do, for such a hymn would not havebeen preserved if composed, but a hymn may, like those to Indra, be preserved with incidental satire if it contains a religious or magic basis. The Vrsakapi hymn 6 which shows Indra and Indram in dispute over a male ape may beadduced in this connexion, but in the absence of any surety as to its meaningit is difficult to rely upon it. 

The positive side of the tendency of the Rigveda to dissatisfaction with the gods of tradition is to be seen in the assertion of the^mityof the gods and of the world. When all is said and done this^is the one important contribution of the Rigveda to the philosophy of India?) It asserts as a norm for the future development of that thought the effort to grasp more concretely and definitely 

the unity, which it asserts as a fact, but which it does not justify or explainin detail. The assertion is made with emphasis in a hymn7 attributed to a quite mythical author Dlrghatamas, who developsat much length the riddle of the

universe. The form of the long hymn of fifty-two verses is, remarkable andcharacteristic. It is a feature of the Vedic sacrifice that at certain points are found Brahmodyas, discussions about the Brahman, the holy power in the universe. Such theosophical riddles are especially common at the horse sacrifice and are often of simple enough kind : the one priest asks,* What is it that doth move alone ? What is ever born again ? What is the remedy of cold ? and what the great pile?' The answers here are obvious enough, and are given as the sun, the moon, the fire, and the earth respectively.1 In this long hymn of Dirghatamas we have a great series of riddles, but there is to beseen in them some degree of cohesion, the influence of the doctrine of the unity of the world. It is frankly expressed as regards the gods in one verse :*Theycall it Indra, Varuna, Mitra, Agni, and the winged bird (the sun) : the onethey call by many names, Agni, Yama, and Matarigvan.' The same idea appears more expresslystill in another verse, where the poet asks the wiser to tell him what supported the six regions of the universe, who was the first unborn being. The hymn is of special further value in that it foreshadows one of the'most common ideas of the philosophy of the Veda, the identity of the sacrifice and the world : the seven priests of earth are paralleled by seven in the heaven, the speech on earth by that in the heaven ; there are also the earthly and the heavenly metres, the earthly Pravargya rite and the rain from heaven, the animal offering and the bull sacrifice of the gods, the altar and the end of the earth, the sacrifice itself and the navel of the world, andthe Soma on earth and the sun and rain. 

The idea of unity is more fully developed and explained in a hymn,8 whichwith all its defects is the most important in the history of the philosophy of India. It is the hymn of creation, and exhibits not merely the puttingof the question of the nature of the universe, but an effort to enter into detail, followed by confession of doubt as to the value of the result achieved. Thehymn is specially interestingfor this latter point : it is true that it may becensured with justice for the fact that its conceptions are full of vagueness, andcrudely seek to unite opposites, but the admission of difficulties is a point which must evoke admiration, not so much for the achievement, but for the thinker who had endeavoured to realize, and had failed to satisfy himself. While much of its content is repeated in the later philosophy,its spirit of doubtis wholly alien to the classical philosophical systems of India. 

The poem commences with an assertion : in the beginning there wasneither being nor not-being :3 there was no atmosphere nor sky : the question is asked what covering there was, and was there a fathomless abyss of the waters. There was neither death nor immortality, nor night nor day. Therewas nothing else in the world save the one which breathed, but without wind, 1 VS. xxiii. 9 and 10. See Haug, Vedische of the RV. Cf.

of its own power. There was, however, darkness, and a moving ocean without light : through the might of fervour, Tapas, was born a living force enveloped in a shell. Then there developed desire, Kama, the first seed of mind : the sages found the root of not-being in being, searching for it in the heart. Thus

far the first four verses : the fifth is a puzzle: it may be referred to the sages who drove a division through the universe and distinguished the upper and the lower, the world of nature above, the principle of nature below : but this version is wholly problematical. The next two verses end with a deep expression of doubt : the gods are later than the creation and cannot know of its origin: whether the creation was made by itself or not, the overseer of it in the highest spaceof heaven he knows of it, or perhaps he knows not. 

The hymn is clearlydifficult to understand : the partof the seers, whichappears merely as a statement of what their reflections have arrived at, is even understood by Bloomfieldl to be a cosmical action, indicating that they took part in the creation of the universe. This seems, however, unnatural and strained, but not more so than the interpretation of verse 5 adopted byDeussen,2 which would make it into an assertion that the sages were able to discriminate between the thing in itself and the phenomenal world, between natura naturam and natura naturata. What is clear is that there is conceived as first existing one thing, which is described as breathing without wind,8 aneffort to express a primitive nature different in essence from anything knownto the priest, conceived perhaps metaphorically only as a dark ocean or chaos. In this through Tapas, which here must rather be cosmic than refer to the activity of seers or other human powers, by inward fervour, springs up the being enveloped in a shell, which in the later conceptionis the golden world egg. The next stepin development is the appearanceof desire, unless that it is to be taken as born of mind, when it is described as the first seed of mind. If so, the mind must be deemed to be an attribute of the one which develops in the shell, whence springsdesire : in the alternative the phrase may be taken as the source which produces mind, and desire, unconscious will, may be held to produceconscious will or mind. The latter view, however, is unnatural in pointof language and has the additional disadvantage that in the Taittiriya Aranyaka4 we alreadyfind that mind is givenas prior to desire in a passage which is based on the hymn. Nor can we hold arid this is much more importantthat Kama was conceived as unconscious will : it is rather the.iiatural expressionfor conscious desire, which would rise fromthe existence of mind as a substratum. The later philosophy makes the knowledge of desires depend on the existence of mind, and this idea may be1 Rel. of Veda, p. 237. Cf. the claims of the3 To compare (Radhakrishnan, 2nd. Phil.

foreshadowed here, where mind is made a cosmic priiis of desire.^ Beyondthis the poet does not go: he ends with the suggestionof a supreme deity as distinct from the gods who are created, and ends with a doubt whether such a deity has power of knowledge,that is, whether it has consciousness at all. We cannot, therefore, really say whether or not the first cause of the world is deemed a conscious entity at all : the assertion that it was not-being, and yet not not-being, which is in words a little inconsistent with the assertion that the sages found the root of being in not-being, searching in the heart, is in effect an assertion that it was a peculiarsort of being,different from ordinary being. The reference to the heart, however, as the place of search reminds us that the heart even in the Rigveda seems the abode of mind,2 and suggests that in the ultimate issue the final entity might be deemed to be possessed of mind, for consciousness, without an object,is the nature in the Vcdanta of the Brahman and even of Purusa in the Samkhya. 

This hymn is the finest effort of the imaginationof the Vedic poet, andnothing else equalsit. The conceptionsof unity, of fervour as the cause of development, of the power in the shell, of the primevalchaos of waters, are all familiar in the Brahmanas and on the whole degraded in their development. In the Rigveda itself the other efforts to attain the conceptionof the unity of the universe arc directed in the main to setting up personal deities, who arc credited with the creation and government of the whole of the universe. Ofthese the most famous and enduring is PrajapatL3 He it is who later at least is the god who is first born, the golden germ, Hiranyagarbha, who creates the whole universe, who gives life, whose commands the gods obey, whose shadowis death and immortality, who is lord of man and beast, of the mountain andthe sea. Thus in the one god are summed up the duties of creator, of ruler, and preserver of the universe*: 

, In the Brahmarias Prajapatiis eternallyidentified with the year, the all creator with the time in which he exercises his eternal processof creation, but this is not stated in the Rigveda,unless in a short hymn4 we are to find the conception of Prajapati underlyingthe year. There fervour, Tapas,is madethe starting-point of all : from it come order, Rta, and truth, the night, andthe primeval ocean : from the ocean was born the year which rules over all, and as creator produces the sun and the moon, the heaven and the earth, the atmosphere and the light of the sun- The parallel to Prajapatiis close, but the identity is not to be certainlyestablished. 

(Vicvakarman,'all-maker ', is another synonym of Prajapati, and has twohymns 6 of the tenth book devoted to his honour^: they add, however, com paratively little to our appreciationof the beginningsof Vedic thought : butwe find here the tendency which is found injbidian conceptions to insist that 1 In the Samkhya it is from Buddhi'intel 3x. 121.

the creator, who is self-created, is not merely the material cause, but also the efficient cause of the world. The process, therefore, by which the worldemerges from the unity at its base assumes a decidedly curious aspect: there is first the unity, which may be conceived as a creator god : then, derived from it, the waters or other primeval substance : then the god appears in the waters as a spirit to bring about the developmentof the universe. This triad of first principle, primitive matter, and the first-born of creation, is carried out mythologicallyin an interesting hymn to Brahmanaspati,1 in which we learn of Daksa as father of Aditi and also her son, an absurdity in which the philosophicbasis is clearly that of the conceptionof the three stages of creation. 

Brahmanaspati is of interest, since his personality as the god of prayer is closely connected with the mighty power of the prayer to secure the ends of man. This idea finds expressionalso in the hymn2 which celebrates Vac, speech, as the supporterof the world, as the companion of the gods, and the foundation of religious activity and all its advantages : she appearsas impelling the father in the beginningof things and again as being born in the waters. The idea which has, of course, long ago been compared by Weberwith the Greek Logos, is ingenious : the will of the creator is thus considered as expressed in speech, but the idea is merely a secondary and unimportantone in the Rigveda, and even later is never destined to be developed in muchdetail, the weight beinglaid on the Brahman, at once the prayer and the holy power in the universe. 

Already in the hymn to Vigvakarman there appearsthe desire to parallel the creation of the universe with a sacrifice. This idea is carried to its fullest extent in the Purusasukta of the Rigveda,3 one of its latest hymns, whichhas often already been mentioned. The first part of the hymn is a strong expression that the Purusa is the universe : the whole of this universe is but a quarter of him, three quarters are immortal ; he has a thousand heads, eyes, and feet, and extends ten digits beyond the universe. In comparison with the normal gods he represents the whole of the world, and not one fraction only. The idea of the three stages appearshere also : the Viraj springs fromPurusa, and Purusa again from the Viraj, which must denote the waters in their cosmic aspect. The next part of the poem insists that the creation of the universe took the form of a sacrifice at which were present the gods, who could not logically have existed : the offering was a holocaust ; from the juice of the burning of the offering sprang the speckled ghee, and from it are derived the animals of the air, the house, and the wild ; all the Vedas, Re, Saman, and Yajus, are assigned to his burning, and further the animals with double incisors and those with a singleset. Then by change of idea the four castes* 1 RV. x. 72. 150 ff.

are derived from the cutting up of the body, and again by a further change the gods and the parts of the world are derived from him : the eye gives the sun, the breath the wind, the mind the moon, perhaps because of its clear light which might be compared with mind, the head the heaven, the feet the earth, and the navel the regions between. Time is explained as connected with the 

means of sacrifice : the rains were the butter, the summer the kindling wood,the autumn the gifts to the priests. The idea is crude and rough and so badlysuited to the connexion with its context, that it is difficult not to believe that we have here the adaptation to the needs of a pantheistic view of a primitive and rude legend of the primeval giant, whence the world was born, an idea found in a different form in Norse mythology.1

CHAPTER 27   

THE THEOSOPHY OF THE BRAHMANAS 

1. The General Character of the Brahmana Philosophy THE value of the Brahmanas as sources of philosophy is difficult to deter mine with any accuracy. They are works in which the imagination of succes sive generations of priests has been allowed to run riot : there is no modera tion in their conception, and no great Brahmana is, as far as can be judged, the production of a single mind.1 The one great merit of Greek philosophy, the appearance of clear-cut ideas expressed in works of individual authorship,is wholly wanting for us in the Brahmanas, and the question constantly obtrudes itself to what extent we can believe that the priests by whom these texts werecomposed and handed down held the views which they wrote down. In manycases it may be taken that they did not ; the works abound in their explana tions of rites with all sorts of absurdities, which we need not accuse the priests of being so foolish as not to recognize as absurdities ; but the question of the dividing line between profoundity and absurdity presents itself with the 

greatest frequency. 

It is, however, another question whether we can acquiesce in the theory of Deussen 2 that the Brahmanas in various places are conscious of higher philosophical views, which they ignore and turn to ritual purposes. Theproofs which he adduces of his theory are far from carrying conviction. In his view the account of the Taittiriya Brahmana3 of the origin of the Naci ketas fire is really posteriorin order of conception to the account in the Katha Upanisad.It is there told that Vaja9ravasa made an offering, at which he gave to the priestsall his goods, retaining, however, his son, Naci ketas, as the ritual prescribes ; the boy, however, insisted that he should also be given,4 and his father in just irritation at his persistence gave him to death. The young man goes, in the true spirit of fairy talc, to the house of Yama, who

parallel to the visit of Bhrgu to the other world, recounted in the atapatha Brahmaija (xi. 6. 1) and the Jaiminiya Brahmana, i. 42-4 (JAOS. xv. 234 ff.). 

Barua's view (Prebuddh. 2nd. Phil, p. 265), that the Naciketas legend represents the philosophy of the Gotamakas mentioned in the Arigut

is away, and who, therefore, for three nights fails in the important duty of the due reception of guests. He must, therefore, on his return make atonement, and he gives the lad three boons. Naciketas chooses the kind receptionof himby his father on his return, the imperishableness of his due reward for his sacrifices and gifts to the priests,1 and the freedom from repeated death not in this world, in all probability. In the two latter cases the god teaches the boy the way of piling the Naciketas fire. To this Deussen takes exception, and thinks that originally the means to the third wish must have been the knowledge of the eternal redemption from the bonds of death, and he holds, therefore, that in the Brahmana we have the expression of a polemical attitude to the more philosophical doctrine. The idea appears, however, to be one wholly unjustifiable. The aim of the ritual is simply to assert the value of this fire, and the repetition of the fire as the means of knowledge of the end desired is perfectly natural and simple. That the boy asked for the grant of final release is nowhere hinted at : what he fears, according to the language used, is simply that, as is often threatened in the later Brahmanas, he mayfall in due course, even in the next world, under the control of death. 

Nor is there any happierresult to be seen in the second case adduced byDeussen. It is of course later in the Ilpanisads the doctrine that the whole essence of man is contained in the Atman,'self ', that the essence of the 

world is also an Atman, and that the two arc identical. This idea he finds expressed in a sentence of the Taittirlya Brahmana,2 where it is said that the various gods, the plants, and trees are in various parts of man, Indra in his strength, Parjanya in his head, the lord, that is Rudra-iva, in his anger, the Atman in his Atman, the Atman in his heart, the heart in him, he in the im mortal, the immortal in the Brahman. In this passage he thinks that the assertion of the identity of the Atman is really a reference to the identity of the self of man and of the universe, an assertion of the fundamental view of the Upanisads wrapped up with a different view. The answer to this is clearly that the passage cannot be pressed to yield so much ; it is possible that it simply has the sense that the body of the world is in the body of man, but it is pro bably merely a vague identification of self with self, without any profound meaning being either felt, or, though felt, hidden. The conscious identifica tion of the universal spirit and the individual is a very different tiling fromsuch a phrase as that in question, and the theory that the phrase indicates a knowledge, but a degradation, of the higher truth, is too far-fetched. 

The point is of importance, since the Vedic tradition makes a clear dis tinction between Brahmanas and Upanisads, though it attaches as we have seen the Upanisads to Brahmaiias. The distinction corresponds, we mayfairly say, in the main to a change of time and still more to a change of view, ,The Upanisads hold in some degreeat least the doctrine of transmigration, and, though not in a developed condition, the pessimism which follows on it : these views are not those of the Brahmanas, which, taken all in all, know not 1 Cf. JB. ii, 53 ; KB. vii. 4.aiii. 10, 8.

442 The Philosophy ofthe Veda [PartV   

transmigration, have no conceptionof pessimism, and therefore seek no release from the toils of life, for which in reality there is no ending. These are funda mental distinctions, and they give an essentiallydifferent aspectto the speculations of the Brahma#as as compared with those of the Upanisads, (Afurther distinction lies in the fact that the Brahmanas are essentially connected with the doctrine of the sacrifice. The sacrifice clearly occupiedthe minds of the priests to the practical exclusion of all else, and their theories were in large measure devoted to the consideration of its relation to the universe, to the gods, and to men.1 In the Upanisadsthis is not the case ; the sacrifice is still here and there the subjectof speculation, but the speculation is no longer based onthe view that the sacrifice is all in all. Hence it is that so little progress can be seen in the Brahmarias towards the development of a real philosophy. TheRigveda carries us nearly as far as anything excogitated in this period.., 

The conceptionof order is one which is wholly strange to the Brahmanas, and any treatment of the philosophy implied and contained in them mustneglect the divisions of these texts, which in the main follow merely the order of the rites performedin the sacrificial ritual. The most important of these conceptions from the pointof view of philosophyare (1) the endeavour to state the nature of the highest principle of the universe, (2) the theory of the sacrifice, and (3) the nature of truth and right. On all of these topics there is available much material, but the sameness of the ideas is obvious througha multitude of detailed differences. 

2. The Highest Principle ofthe Universe 

In the period of the Brahmanas the god Prajapati occupies without doubt or question the position of the creator god, the supreme god of the world/The commencement of legend after legend proclaimshis creative activity, often figured under the form of the practising of fervour, a reminder of the cosmic heat, whence came forth the power enclosed in the shell according to the view of the hymn of creation.2 The world egg appearsas producing the heaven and the earth from its two parts, and, as Hiranyagarbha,it is the form of Prajapati, in which he proceedsto immediate creation of living beings of all kinds, and the ordering of the universe. These tales, of which there is no end, often tell us that Prajapatifelt at the end of his efforts that he wasempty, and had to be filled up again, always by some ritual process. Thedetails of these sti^wTmythsare wholly unimportant : it is enough to note that he is constantly the creator, the ruler, and the preserverof the world andis accepted by every Brahmana of the periodas beingthe lord of the world : he is, it may be added, without any ethical importance: the conceptionof him is purely intellectual, that of the unity of the universe, and the choosing

Chap. 27] The Highest Principle of the Universe 443  

of Prajapati as the symbol of this unity is one of the most striking proofsof the great influence of the Rigveda upon the period of the Brahmanas.* Of Prajapati's activities the most interesting are his relation as creator to the gods, to the Asuras, whose connexion is with the darkness and cunning, and to men. He is, however, much more than the mere universe : he is the unmeasured, the unexpressed, as opposed to the measured and the expressed in nature : he is the seventeenth beside the sixteen elements of the psychic organs : the thirty-fourth above the thirty-three gods. He is universal peace, the decider of disputes among the gods ; he gives Indra his victorious prowess and his crown of victory. He is devoid of sorrow, for there is nosorrow in heaven. He is the lord of the three worlds, he sits above them andsees in himself the seed of creation, and the gods proceed from his mouth, the Asuras from his descending breath, that of nutrition. 

It is, however, clear that in Prajapati the Brahmanas do not find complete satisfaction for their view of the construction of the universe. The Atharva veda, which in these matters must be ranked with the Brahmanas,^n its version of the great hymn of the Rigveda, which, as later expanded,1 mentions him as all-creator, leaves out the last line givinghis name and the Brahmanaof that Veda, which is certainly late, replaces him by the Brahman andAtharvan.2 In the Brahmanas, therefore, we find efforts made to arise to a principle above and beyond him : in the Rigveda he produced from himself the idea of world creation is always in the Vedic literature regarded in the light of the sending out of something already there rather than of mere bringing into being the waters, and then entered them in the form of Hiranyagarbha, the golden germ. In the Taittiriya Samhita,3 we find in the spirit of the hymn of creation the waters treated in two places as the prius, and Prajapati as arising as wind on them, and the atapatha Brahmana4goes one step farther in attributing to the waters as Prajapati's predecessors as first in order the act of fervour, which is primarily his activityin creation. A farther stepis taken in the Taittiriya Aranyaka,6 in which the waters come first, then Prajapati, in whose mind desire arises6 and who practises fervour ; then his body he throws off : from the sap is born the tortoise, who is Purusa, who, however, asserts his priority to Prajapati himself, and from the flesh the seer ArunaketU, to whom further creative activityis assigned. Yet another stepis reached in the fatapatha Brahmaria,7 where the first thingis stated to be not-being, then arises Prajapati, who is the same as Purusa, and then the Brahman,the holy science, the threefold Veda, with which he enters the waters as a creative principle. Thus sprang up the world egg, whence came forth first the

444 The Philosophy ofthe Veda [Partv   

Brahman itself, and then Prajapati in the form of Agni. But in another account l the priority of the Brahman over Prajapatiis made absolute, not merely empirical : the first entity is not-being, then springsinto life mind, i.e. the Brahman, and then Prajapati. Later still the Brahman produces Prajapati, but without face or sight ; then it enters him, as breath, and makes

him mortal, to arise as a generator of beings. 

There is nothing particularly valuable or serious in these attempts, though they merit mention. More interesting are efforts to explain the nature of Prajapati, and to dispose thus of him. The position of Prajapatias decider of disputes leads to the view that he intervenes in the great disputeof the mind and speech as to which should be given the higher rank, a disputesettled 

by Prajapati in favour of mind.2 The connexion of speech and mind8 as elements in Prajapatihimself is expressed by the figure of union between the two within him, and either is occasionally made into the final entity of the world : thus mind is identified with Brahman, with Prajapati, and even with the first principle, which is neither being nor not-being,of the hymn of creation.4Similarly Vac,*speech ', is identified with Prajapati, or even placed above Prajapati, identified with Viyvakarman,with the whole world, and 

with Indra.5 These identifications are, however, despitetheir interest, of 110 importance for Indian philosophy: the will or the intellect as such does not in fact become the essential reality of any Indian orthodox philosophy. Prajapati is also the sacrifice,6 and sacrifices himself to the gods, for, as wehave seen, the order of the world is constantly compared with the sacrifice, and Purusa by being sacrificed creates the universe : he is also the year,7 or both,8 and these identifications are of great importancein connexion with the theory of sacrifice to which we shall return. 

In the Atharvaveda9 we find several further efforts to substitute for Prajapati new names and ideas. In this effort it is certainlydifficult to resist the view that the Atharvaveda is put of the main stream of Vedic develop ment : the hymns seem like deliberateTefforts to convert into a kind of poetry the philosophicalideas of the Brahmana period without any real inspiration of any sort. The abstractions Kala, 'time',10 and Rohita,11 'the ruddy one ', probably the sun as the more concrete expressionof time, are identified with Prajapati and praisedas all-creating: the ox12 and the cow, Vaga,13 are also identified with the god, and may to some extent be comparedwith the view of the Brahmanas, that the sacrifice is Prajapati.

Atharvaveda goes farther and in its pseudo-theosophyexalts many other things to the rank of supreme powers,the ladles, the Darbha grass amulet, the porridge cookeid for the priest, the bull offered in the sacrifice, the deity Anumati, and possiblyothers.1 In two cases a deeper meaning has been

seen by Deussen,2 who finds in the Skambha hymns3 an effort to find a principle above Prajapati which supports the whole universe, and in the Ucchista 4 hymn, a glorification of* what is left over ', not, as is normallybelieved, from the offering, but after all that is empirical has been abstracted from the universe, an idea which he thinks can possibly be reconciled with the normal view by remembrance of the fact that Purusa in the sacrifice hymnis said to be onlyaquarter in the universe, the other three-quarters being beyond it. But it is impossibleto take this speculation seriously, and the Skambha hymn has no great claim to be more than a poor piece of theo sophical juggling with words, save in so far as it seems to identify Skambhawith the Brahman, and as it served as a suggestionfor the MuncjakaUpanisad.5 

But beside these ideas there is to be found a much more fruitful source of philosophy, the creation of the conceptionof the Brahman as a cosmic principle. The origin of the meaning of Brahman is uncertain : it is inter preted by the Vedanta school, absurdly,as the absolute from vrh,6 twist ', 4tear away'; the view of Max Mtiller6 is that it denotes what grows, fromvrh in the sense of4grow ', that which expressesitself in speech or in nature as force. The view of Deussen7 is that it is the human will in its striving to the divine, when the individual in prayer returns to the timeless, spaceless, iudividualless self of his, which is God. These senses are somewhat elaborate, and render it difficult to think that the word really had any such meaning : neither for the views of Max Miiller nor for that of Deussen is there anysupport in the actual use of the word in the Rigveda. There at any rate the word naturally and normally means prayer, but there are further develop ments : it can mean spell, for the prayer may be a spell,8 and not real prayer,

and it often means holy speech and the holy writ, the three-fold Veda. It is not necessary to trace to the original sense of Brahman the fact that the Vedic poet regards himself often as inspired : we cannot really think it probable, and certainly no argument had yet been adduced to show, that the prayer wasfelt to be the voice of God speaking in the prayer. But in many passages it seems as if Brahman must be taken rather as holy power than as prayer or holy rite : the gods are said to discuss the Brahman, and, when the great ness of the Brahman is celebrated, it is clear that more than the mere word maybe intended. But the growth of the idea of Brahman as a suitable expression for the absolute must have been greatly furthered by the extraordinary value attached to the prayer and to the spell. The prayer rapidly passes over to the lower rank : in one late hymn of the Rigvedax a prayer is offered that Agni should in union with the Brahman drive away disease. The spell appears repeatedly by itself in the Atharvaveda as a power to destroy evil of all kinds, and the Brahman is actually set over against the three Vedas as a powerof equal force.2 It is a very easy step from the conception of the Brahman as the prayer, which brings into operation the activity of the gods, or as the spell which is the cause of results aimed at by men, and from the conception of the whole body of such spells and prayers, to develop the use of the term to cover the idea of holy power generally, and this rendering is applicable in manypassages of the Brahmanas, where the idea of holy writ is too vague and the idea of the absolute is too elaborate. 

A further element should doubtless be allowed for in the process of the evolution of the use of the term Brahman. Oldenberg,8indeed, has denied that in the Veda there exists either the idea or the word for a supernatural power pervading the universe, akin to that power which in Melanesia is 

denoted by mana, among the Hurons by orenda, and variously in other parts of the world.4 It seems, however, unlikely that no such general idea should have appealed to the intellect of the Indians. If we accept,as we should, the view that individual powers are older in conception than manifestations of a universal power, still it seems natural to suppose that India developed the conception of a power common to the various gods, just as there was admitted the unity of the gods even by the time of certain Rigvedic hymns. This power, we may assume, was naturally denoted by the term Brahman, as a result of the extraordinary importance attached by priests to the prayers and spells 

which secured them their means of livelihood, and which served to propitiate the gods or to secure ends desired by their patrons or themselves. Other terms such as Maya, which served in part to denote a power similar to mana, failed 

gods, or vice versa, in religious life; Cf. Marett, Archiv fur Rel. xii. 186 ff. ; cf. Guntert, Der arische Weltkdnig, pp. Preuss, ibid. xiii. 427 ff. ; Soderblom, 222 ff' ibid. xvii. 1 ff. ; Strauss, Brhaspati im

to be widely generalized. Asu possibly served the same purpose,if we believe the view of Gtintert that Asura denotes primarily and properlythe possessor of mana.1 

A very different view of the nature of the Brahman is presented by Hertel,2 who asserts that the misinterpretation of the term is one of the many fatal errors of Vedic scholarship, shared alike by the Indian and the western inter preters. The essential work of Indian philosophersof the Upanisad period was to depersonalize the old gods, and to show that in the macrocosm and the microcosm alike there existed nothing save nature powers and processes, whichrequired no explanation by the assumption of divinities. The Ksatriyas whowere the sources of the doctrine of the Upanisads rejected the doctrine of personal deities, and also the theory that man's lot depended on his deeds, and constructed in lieu a materialistic, monistic, science of nature, whichwas at once morally indifferent and in essence atheistic. The priests decided to render innocuous this doctrine by amalgamating it with their own as anesoteric system. On this view the Brahman is that which fills all beings, stimulates the sense organs, penetrates the whole world, and encircles the universe. Its true nature is revealed in those passages of the Upanisads whichdescribe the Brahman as qualified, the unqualified Brahman being manifestly the product of further refinement of speculative thought. Now in certain passages3 we find that the Brahman is the bodily warmth in man, which is identified with his self, Atman, and also with the cosmic light or fire (tejas or jyotis). These passages are to be taken perfectly literally, and this version throws an important light on the Indian ascetic, Tapasa, who is a very different person from the Christian ascetic. The latter practises chastity andflees from desires, because these are the work of the devil, and he seeks to kill carnal longings. The Tapasa inflicts even more serious penances on himself and remains celibate, merely to increase the vital fire within him, and fit him self for the abundance of sexual delight which Indian opinionas early as the Atharvaveda 4 and even in the Upanisads5 assures him. The fire, however, which composes the self of the individual, is essentially bound up with the power of thought.6 The cosmic Brahman, on the other hand, is fire (jyotis) in no metaphorical sense ;7 the brahmanah parimarah of the Aitareya Briih mana 8really means that all comes from fire and is resolved into it again. Nowthe connexion of the individual and the cosmic fire is simple ;9 the rays of the sun bring fire into the heart of the individual, and at death the fire departs from

him back to the sun whence it came, or rather to the heaven of fire, which lies above the earth and of which the sun and the moon are doors pierced in it. Theidea of this path of lightis older than the Upanisads,for it occurs in verses cited in the Brhadaranyaka Upanisad,1 and the Atharvaveda2 knows the threads of which life is woven and calls this knowledge the great Brahmana,that is the great secret of the Brahman. Prior to the Upanisads we find the conception in a personal shape, Brhaspati, the lord of the heaven of light, the peer of Zeus Pater, of Jupiter, of the German war god, a form of Dyaushimself. It is for this that he appearsin the Rigveda as the highest of gods, their father and ruler, guardian of the Rta, leader of men, enemy of all that is false, an Indian parallel to Ahura Mazdah. Significant is his connexion with Narasansa, for in the Avesta Nairyosanha is not merely the envoy of AhuraMazdah, but also the fire which burns in the kings and secures them in their power. Brhaspati as lord of the heaven is responsiblefor breaking through its stone boundary to set the sun as a source of the streaming forth of its light ; moreover he has placed the stars there, arid released through the apertures the waters amid the noise of his thunders.3Significant is the assertion that he encompasses or is presentin all (vibhu), the Rigveda4 thus saying of the personal deity what the Upanisads assert of the depersonalized Brahman. 

The obvious question why the term Brahman is so regularly used of prayer in the Rigveda is answered by the theory that the cause is used for the effect, and similarly the use of re and dM, dhtti, and didhiti is explained. Moreover a suitable etymology is found in the comparison with the Greek

<f>Xyu and Latin flagro, and the Brahmacarin of the Atharvaveda5 is ex plained as one who concentrates in himself the fire from which all conditions and actions in the world are derived. The fact that Brhaspati appears in the Rigveda already as a moon god, which Hertel accepts from Hillebrandt,8 is explained as due to the gradual fading out of the idea of the sun and moon as merely doors to heaven and the abode of the Soma, the rain, and the Fathers, and the emergence of the conception of the moon as actually the home of these beings. 

Ingenious as is the theory, it is clear that it cannot claim acceptance as probable. The idea that fire pervades and constitutes the essence of the universe is based on the interpretation given to the Brahman ; independent evidence is wholly lacking ; Hertel cites only an Atharvan7passagein whichit is stated that fire exists in the earth, the plants, the waters, stones, men,cattle, and horses, and an Avestan reference8 to six fires which the Pahlavi tradition interprets as the fire in kings, the temple fire, afed that of everyday

use, the fire in the body of men and beasts, the fire in plants, the fire of lightning, and the fire in the paradise of Ahura Mazdah. Neither of these passages even suggests that fire is the essential principle of the universe, aijd 

the ojily other proof, the etymology of Brahman, is extremely far from con vincing. Not a single passage is adduced in which Brahman normally or naturally denotes fire, and the transfer of meaning allegedis harsh and im plausible, for the alleged parallel of re and dhl is quite unprovecl. The wholetheory in fact rests on the overestimation of the terms light (tejas or jyotis) applied to the self, individual or cosmic, and insistence on treating them as essentially material. We have to deal with an early stage of intellectual effort, and with the great difficulty of expressing the nature of the self in anything butmaterial terms, as well as with the fact that the Brahman is not an abstraction. It is something which embraces all, and which is manifested in the warmth of the body and in the heat of the sun. But it is manifested also in the breath of man and in the wind, and it is to exaggerate one element out of all propor tion to find the fundamental reality in fire, even when that fire is deemed to beendowed with intelligence, and therefore to be much more than merely material. 

In the process of evolution of the conception of Brahman an importantpart is played by the identification of the Brahman and Brhaspati,*the lord of prayer': he is in the later periodof the Brahmanas always regardedas the Purohita of the gods,as their Brahman priest in the technical sense of the term and also as the Brahman itself,1 an idea which is often expressed. NowBrhaspati is the depository of great power already in the Rigveda, and this element undoubtedly aided the conceptionof the Brahman to obtain great prominence. This prominence as usual takes the form of identification withmany diverse things, such as speech and truth and holy order, Rta,2 as the wind into which the five deities, sun, moon, fire, lightning and rain all enter andfrom which they emerge,3 as the breaths,4 and often as the sun.5 In the latter aspect the Brahman appearsas the firstborn of the day, and perhaps also as the firstborn of the whole creation, a conception which placesit on a lower plane than the final reality. The tendency is, however, more and more to place the Brahman on that plane:as we have seen, Prajapati, who at first is the superior of and the creator of the Brahman, as the holy writ, becameidentified with the Brahman, as is often expresslystated in the Brahmanas,and is at last placed below the Brahman as a metaphysical principle. Withthis view we attain to the conceptionof Brahman Svayambhu,6 the Brahmanwhich exists of itself and which is regarded as being the cause of the universe, in which it sacrifices itself in the usual parallelism of the world and the

450 The Philosophy ofthe Veda [Party sacrifice, the groundof the continued existence of the universe, and the source into which on death thingsreturn. Hence we meet the idea that bycorrect sacrifice a man may succeed in obtaining community of life and abodewith the Brahman, or by right study of the Veda avoid repeated death andattain identity of essence with the Brahman.1 The further stepis taken to apply to the Brahman the attribute of takingthe place of the highest god, Prajapati or Vi?vakarmanof the Rigveda, and this is duly done in the Taittiriya Brahmana.2 The Atharvaveda3 in its own peculiar way recognizes the same idea in its explanationof the Brahman and the Brahmacarin, the Brahman student, as the highestof beings.   

The final step to be taken in the conceptionof the Brahman was to identify it with the Atman,4 which, from another pointof view in the Brahmaiias, attains the position of representative of the unityof the world, and this step is partially taken in the Taittiriya Brahmana,5 where the Brahman and the omnipresent itman are identified, and the self of man, as it seems, is stated to be the mode of finding the Atman, while knowledge of it frees from contamina 

tion by works, and the same idea occurs in the atapatha Brahmana.6 Boththese passages, however, are clearly transitional to the periodof the Upanisads, and mark the end of the reflections of the Brahmanas before the new views were definitely accepted. 

Apart from the most improbable etymology, suggested by Hertel, whichhas been discussed above, there is, as we have seen, no ground to find more in the word than, in the first place, prayer, and the development which it undergoes is in all probability to be attributed to the growthof the importance of the prayer in the mind of the priest, not in the realization of the subjective nature of prayer as the striving towards the divine, which is in reality the human, will. The Brahman is, therefore, rather a conceptionof the ritual andof religion, not a psychological principle, and it is in my opinion impossible to accept the view of Deussen,7 that the Atman is evolved from the Brahmanby developing the conceptionof the subjective element, which layin the latter. The conceptionof the Brahman and the Atman is late, and has every appearance of being a syncretism8 due to the fact that the two expres sions had by diverse ways come to be regardedas expressionsfor the samething, the highest reality and unity of the universe, and the historyof the Atman suggests that it had from the first an independentexistence. This viewis certainly strengthened by the fact that the opinionof Deussen is based to some degree on a new etymology, which he suggestsfor that wo^d: in place of the root an,*breathe ', at,4 move ', or av (= vd),* blow ', and connexion with the Greek dr/^s, d{/V/x^, and Germanic alum, aedhm, he suggests that igB> xi< 4. 4 . 5 Ct 9. x. 6. 3.

it is a highly abstract word derived from the roots a seen in aham,'I ', and ta, *this ', so that it denotes*this I,' the self, which in due course is felt to bethe final expression possiblefor the ultimate fact of existence, arrived bystripping away the various coverings which envelop the ultimate reality, the covering of the body, the covering of the mind, the covering of the intellect. This view he supports, not merely by the undoubted difficulties* in the explanation of the form Atman, and of the corresponding form in the Rigveda, without the,but also by the suggestion that the development of meaningassumed from 6 wind ', in which sense it is found only four times in the Rigveda, to 6self'is more difficult than the development of meaning which his ownetymology would give. Thus he thinks from4 this I'could easily spring the view of the body in contrast to the outer world, and thence the trunk in contrast to the limbs, and on the other hand the sense of the soul in opposition to the body, and real being in oppositionto unessential things. The possibility of such an etymology must, however, be denied : without pretending that the problems of the relation of Atmaii and Tman is easy, or that the etymologyis certain, the fact remains that the word does mean4 wind'in the Rigveda,2 that the normal use of it there is'breath of life ', and that the meaning' wind 'is harder to deduce from*breath ', than vice versa, and that to deduce either' wind'orc breath' from the conceptionof'this I'is extremely difficult. 

The real history of Atman seems then to be that from the meaning' wind' sprang early up that of'the breath': thence came the meaning'self ', as when it is said of Surya that he is the self of that which stands and moves.3 Then we have the use of the self as a reflexive pronoun, and the use as meaningthe body,4 an idea which is clearly intended when it is contrasted with Prana, *the breath': the meaning' trunk ',5 as opposed to limbs, is an easy develop ment from this sense. But the sense'breath'or*self'is also capableof being understood in more abstract ways, and we, therefore, find Atman used to denote the essential nature of a thing : this use is already found in the Rigveda 6 where the nature of the breath, the blood, the self of the earth, is put as a question, and similarly we hear of the self of the disease Yaksma,7 of all beings, and the adjective atmanvant,*possessingexistence '.8 But of much more importance is the development of the use of the word to denote the self of man in direct distinction from the members of his body and his bodyitself : it must be admitted that the use is far from common in the Vedicliteratui$, but twice in the Atharvavcda9 the contrast of Atman with breath and body seems clearly intended, and the same thing must be admitted for two passages in theatapatha,10 in which either one or ten breaths are set over

against the self. Further, it seems that efforts were being made to define the self either as mind or as consciousness, Vijnana.1 

The developmentof the meaning of Atman was accompanied by the development of the conception of the relation of the Atman of the universe andthe Atman of the individual. The comparisonof the macrocosm and the microcosm had been familiar from the time of the Rigveda,2 where the cosmic Purusa is clearly closelyallied to the individual man. In the case of Purusa, however, under that name we do not find that the conceptionof his Atmanwas developed : of the individual man we have the question asked, later at least, what is left after his members are dispersed by death ; but, though it might have been expectedthat this problem would have been posedin the case of Purusa, there is no evidence that this was ever done. The reference to the cosmic Atman seen by Deussen3 in a passageof the Taittiriya Brahmana4 is as shown above too doubtful to found any argument upon : if the cosmic Atman is really deliberately meant, it is very strange that the series of identi fications of macrocosm and microcosm should not end there, but should proceed to the abode of the Atman in the heart, the heart in the man, the manin the immortal, and the immortal in the Brahman. More important is the recognition of the Atman as cosmic in the Atharvavcda, as the conclusion of the second Skambha hymn.5 

In the case of Prajapati, the developmentof the conceptionof the Atmanis very clear : the creator enters, in the view of the Rigvedae and of all subsequent texts, into the creation with his spirit, and the terms now used in the late works, the Taittirlya Aranyaka7 and the Tadcva section of the Vajasancyi Samhita,8 are that he enters with the self into the self. It is needless to press the exact force of these words : it is sufficient to note that they obviously lend themselves to the view of the identity of the cosmic self with the self of man. The actual expressionof this identity is found only occasionally and in late texts such as the Taittirlya Aranyaka9 and the 

ivasamkalpa section of the Vajasaneyi Samhita,10 both works which arc of the latest period of the Brahmana epoch and closely analogous to Upanisads, while the identification of the Atman and the Brahman is also, as we have seen, confined to texts of the most developed stratum of Brahmana philosophy, the Taittirlya Brahmana n and the atapatha Brahmana,12 in either case in late 

chapters. 

Of other expressionsof the inner nature of man, the Purusa is of no very serious importancefor the philosophyof this epoch: he is indeed mentionedin two sections of the Vajasaneyi Samhita, the Uttaranarayana and the

Tadeva, in which he is identified with Prajapati, and with Brahman, ensouls nature, is before but is also produced by the gods,is the source of time and is without limit in space ; moreover the cosmic and the individual self appear to be identified, and we find the doctrinex that, as Anquctil du Perron expresses 

it, 'Quisquis Deum intelligit Deus fit;' the inspiredseer can becomeidentical with the deity, entering with his own self into the self.2 But, thoughthe term Purusa is occasionally used as a vague expressionfor the humanpersonality,8 it is not destined to become in this period ever a very definite or 

clear conception. On the other hand the Brahmanas have an important principle of existence to match with the Atman, and one the prominenceof which never disappears entirelyin Indian philosophy, though the Samkhyasystem seeks to diminish its place. This is the conceptionof the Prana or the Pranas,'breath'or*vital airs ', which achieves an importancedenied to the older term Asu. 

The importanceof the breath is due obviously to its connexion with the life of man or beast, and we find in the atapatha Brahmana4 the express statement that the victim is the breath, since only while it breathes is it abeast at all, and, when the breath departs,it is a mere inert mass. But the term is naturally enough extended to other forms of the activity of life, the speech, the hearing, the sight, and the mind, and further in the Vcdic viewbetween the organ and the activity there was no very clear distinction :5 the ear is what hears and the hearing, the eye what sees and the sight, and so on. The number of the vital airs is very various : they can be reckoned pretty much at pleasure as two, three, five, seven, nine, twelve, thirteen, and so on. But nine arc often mentioned : seven in the head and two below.6 The seven in the head arc the mind, speech, the breath itself, the two eyes and the twoears, and those below the organsof reproduction and evacuation. But the seven can be reduced to live by counting the cars and eyesas one organ each, and from quite different points of view we have six,7 two eyes,nostrils andears, or two, Prana and Udana, or three, Prana, Udana, and Apana.8 These

vital airs arc repeatedlycalled the gods, Devas : they are produced from the ascending airs of Prajapati with which he created the gods, and the view that these activities are divine is a perfectly natural one from the point of view of 

Vedic religion, and it is quite unnecessaryx to attribute the use of the termto the fact that no word for nature powers existed. 

The multitude of Pranas, however, rest upon a single Prana, which is some times, it would seem, sought to be identified with mind, but normally is called the Mukhya Prana, the chief of the breaths. Its position appears clearly in a legend of creation in the atapatha Brahmana.2 From the not-being arose the seven Pranas in the shape of the seven seers : they were kindled up by the Prana in the middle as Indra, whereupon they produced the seven Purusas, which again united themselves to one Purusa. The same priority of onePrana is elsewhere expressed by the relationship of it to the others as like that of Prajapati to the gods.3 

It was of course quiteinevitable that the eternal comparison of macrocosmand microcosm should here play its part, and so, in pointof fact, we find the relationship of the breath as the principle of life in man, and the cosmic Prana, which is the wind, asserted in the Qatapatha Brahmana.4 Nor are there lacking evidences of efforts to make Prana the one reality, as Atman wasso made : Prana is identified with Prajapati, and also the Atman, but these views are late and isolated.5 The theosophy of the Atharvaveda6 with its cosmopolitanism, however, accepts the Prana readily as an expressionof the universal, just as it accepts the Brahman, and as it sees in the Atman the sameessence as the meaning of the universe. 

3. The Theory of the Sacrifice 

Amid an infinity of varied details the Brahmanas present a perfectly definite body of opinion as to the fundamental nature of the sacrifice,7 and in connexion with the sacrifice of the gods, the Asuras, the seers, and men. This theory is the most characteristic and independent partof the Brahmanas : in the speculationsas to the unity of the universe and the god in whom that unity finds expression, the Brahmanas are only inheritors of the speculation of the Rigveda, but in the doctrine of the sacrifice they develop a theory which may have been held in germ at least in the age of the Rigveda, but whichis not expressed there and which doubtless in considerable measure is a newcreation. This is indicated by one fundamental fact : the sacrifice in the Brahmanas is a piece of magic pure and simple : this is assuredly not the

Chap. 27] The Theory of the Sacrifice 455  

attitude of the average seer of the hymns of the Rigveda. The turning into magic of the sacrifice is, we have seen, a conception which is -secondary : the existence of magic as early as the sacrifice is one thing :^ the converting of what was originally a sacrifice into magic is, like the art of black magic, a subsequent development^ 

In this theory of the universe there is much that cannot be called in anynormal sense philosophical, but taken as a whole it is impossibleto deny the name of philosophyto an ordered view of the universe, fully thought out, and within its fundamental limitations logical and complete. 

The basis of the whole system is the identification of the sacrifice with Prajapati, who is the creator par excellence. The exhaustion of Prajapati oncreation is the exhaustion of the sacrifice : the work of creation is carried out with the aid of the sacrifices of various kinds : the danger to which the creatures whom he creates are exposed from the jealousy of the gods has to be overcome by new sacrifices invented for them, for Agni, the Maruts, even for Varuna. As the sacrifice, Prajapatiis all creative, the gods and the Asuras arise from his upgoing and his descending breaths, from him are sprung men,the beasts, the plants and the trees, the minerals as well as the heaven andthe earth and the mountains. But, while he is the all-father, still his nature as the sacrifice presents another relationship: he is father of Agni, but as the sacrifice Agni recomposcs him and so is his father :1 and similarly with the gods as a whole. Moreover he is the creator of the sacrifice as well as the sacrifice : he invents rite after rite to aid the gods in their struggles with the Asuras, and he was the first to invent the words used in the sacrifice and its varied forms. Moreover the sacrifice is not only Prajapati, but, as he is the first to sacrifice, so he is the first victim to beoffered.2 He gave himself to the gods, and when he did so he created a counterpart of himself in the form of the sacrifice, and thus he redeemedhis life from the gods. Yet again,as the first to sacrifice, he is the first to win the reward of sacrifice and to ascend to the sun.3 

Prajapati is not merely the creator of beings, but he reduces them to order from their confusion by entering them with form, Rupa, and name, Naman.4 The same feat is accorded to the Brahman by another text, and the form is identified with mind and the name with speech.5 These two figure in a contest for priority, the mind claiming that speechis but an imitation of it, while speech lays stress on the fact that it gives means of expression and communica tion. But Prajapati decides, in favour of the mind, a struggle which is con stantly taken up again in the Upanisads, and which has a famous parallel in the Roman legendof the contest of the members and the stomach.6Speech,

however, remains of value and aid to Prajapati, and encourages him when he is in doubt or is wearied ; he sends her forth to be revealed as the earth, atmo sphere, and sky ; she is his bride, to bear creation.1 She forms, therefore, a ground of contest between the gods and the Asuras : the gods win her byinducing the sacrifice to make overtures to her :2again the gods obtain by the offer of her the Soma from the Gandharvas : she brings back the Soma, andthe two sides seek to retain her : the Gandharvas recite the Veda, the gods dance and sing and win her foolish heart by these base means. Again she flies from them and enters the wood, but the gods find her and she curses the wood for delivering her up : the trees, however, distributed her in the drum, the lute, and other places.3 At another time she is wroth with the Angirases who prefer Surya to her as a sacrificial fee, and leaves the gods, remaining in the space between them and the Asuras and becoming a lioness.4 She is, however, won over. The distinction of speech was accomplished by Indra in return for a fourth partof the Soma : one quarter only is distinct, the other parts are the speechesof the beasts, the birds, and insects.5 Among men the speech is best in the country of the Kuru-Pancalas, and the Asuras andbarbarians alike talk a bad speech.6 

To the other gods the sacrifice stands in a slightly different relation : Visnu indeed is often identified with the sacrifice, but this idea, though im portant, and doubtless an expressionof the high standing in the pantheonof that god, is not in all probability much more than a recognition of this im portance. Visnu plays no very great partin the theosophy proper. 'The gods are, like the Asuras, children of Prajapati, but, though born of the nobler part of the god, are yet in physical strength weaker : they are, however, superior in science, and by their knowledge of the sacrifice they can defeat their rivals. They arc essentially in the control of the sacrificer : the seers can even seize and hold them fast, for despitetheir possession of more than one body they can be presentat only one rite at a time. Kutsa holds Indra bycords ; Lu^a taunts the god who breaks free, but Kutsa with a new Samanbrings him back : a later version of the legend, however, allows of the division of the god into his person and his greatness.7\ The sacrifice or the threefold knowledge, which is the essence of the sacrifice, is the essence of the gods. Thegods are lovers of the recondite,8compact of truth, but the truth is nothing butexactness in the rites and the formulae of the sacrifice. To the sacrifice they owe the glory and powerwhich is theirs, and, what is far more important,their

immortality,1 which they gain by the sacrifice : they are ever represented as being in fear of death, or Yama, or the cnder, the year, death, Prajapati. Over the question of immortality they have desperate struggles with the Asuras, whom the atapatha often, and the Pancavin^a once, make their elder brothers : in one case the gods were being steadilykilled because usna, 

the Asura, had in his mouth the ambrosia, which Indra as an eaglestole fromhim, thus depriving his breath of the power to revive the smitten Asuras.2 The struggle with the Asuras repeats itself in innumerable forms : in one case Indra metamorphizes himself into a female jackal, and runs thrice round, winning the earth :3 more famous is the use of Visnu, the sacrifice, as adwarf to accomplish the winning of the earth from the Asuras,4 or moredirectly the three citadels of the Asuras, of iron, silver, and goldin the three worlds, are overthrown by the performance of the Upasad ceremonies.5 The gods also by the use of the new- and full-moon sacrifices force the Asurasto abandon the half month of waning moon, which they had occupied.6 

In the struggle the sacrifice plays a constant part: the gods are often aided by advice from Prajapati, and they apply themselves to severe penances to bring about victory, but the decisive thing in their favour is their knowledgeof the correct mode of offering : the Asuras put the bricks in the fire altar with the mark below,7 in the preliminary rites they shave first the hair, then the beard, then the arm-pits ;8they offer a white victim born of a black mother,9 and these errors arc fatal. They try magic but without success. Thegods on their part cajole the chaplainsof the demons, anda, Marka, andU^anas, and are willing to break faith for victory : they detach the Raksasesfrom the Asuras by promise of equal shares of the spoil, and they refuse themany share at all. 10 They defeat the Asuras by the inability of the latter to find a feminine for the word five,11 but more often they have to fight hard battles. One story shows the Asuras seekingto build a fire altar to reach the heaven : Indra disguises himself, is allowed to put on a brick, and, when it is all butfinished, he drags it away with the result that the altar falls.12 Even, however, within the divine family there are disagreements : the ancient Sadhya gods seem to have vanished from importance,13 but the Adityas and the Aiigirases are bitter rivals. Here, again, however, the value of knowledge of the sacrifice is the most important thing of all, and the Adityas arc superior by far in this

and reach heaven before the Angirascs, who have to serve them in place of being served by them. The same defective knowledge in the Angirases leads them to require teaching from Nabhanedistha, for which they have to paydearly, and drives them to compromises with the Fathers.1 

The sacrifice is, however, the source of disagreement among the gods ; the advantages of it are far too great to allow of the gods being content to share equally, and we hear that Visnu, recognized as the first of the gods byreason of his sacrificial skill, makes himself hated for his pride, and the gods induce the ants to gnaw through his bowstring, so that his head is carried away.2 Even when, at a session in Kuruksetra, it had been agreedto share the glory of the sacrifice, when it is attained by Soma,3 he appropriates it, andIndra readily destroys Namuci, when he finds that he can do so by stretching the words of his oath. The several residences of the gods is exclusive ; they do not visit one another. They race one another for shares in the offering, andIndra and Vayu bear off the first places. 

The danger from the Asuras drives the gods to close union ; they find that they must have mutual confidence, and they make a pact depositingtheir bodies with Varuna, on the understanding that he who violates it shall not bereunited with his forms.* They are further compelled to resort to monarchy : they chose Varuna, Agni, or Soma, as king, but finally they perform the great consecration of Indra : the All-gods serve as heralds, the water of consecration is poured on by Prajapati, the Vasus assist at the east, the Rudras in the south, the Adityas at the west, the All-godsat the north, the Sadhyas and Aptyasin the centre, the Maruts and the Angirases at the zenith.5 

.Despite the relations of the gods with the sacrifice, the sacrifice is by nomeans alwdys loyal to them : it flees from them, taking now the form of Visnu, now that of a Suparna bird, now that of a horse, or of a black antelope. 

tNor have the gods ever learned the whole art of sacrifice, even as men have not had it revealed to them : they pick up fragments of it from time to time. Theymay even have to seek knowledge from the Ksis such as the snake seer, Arbuda Kadraveya. 

The place of the seers is in view of their relation to the sacrifice one of great importance : they are the means by which in the normal case men secure theessential knowledge of the ritual, and they are often indebted to the gods for it ; Nodhas is taught a Saman by them in reward for his learning. They evendeclare that i$u Angirasa was entitled to call the Fathers*my children* owing to his knowledge of the ritual, as in the Atharvaveda the seer may byinsight win the position of father of his father. The Vaikhanasas, the seers, whom Rahasyu Devamalimluc slew at Munimarana, were revived by Indra, and the same god revived Upagu Saufravasa, whom his royal master Kutsa

had killed for persistingin the worship of India.1 Atri, on his part, saves the sun from the grip of the Asura Svarbhanu, the darkness disappearing as a succession of variously coloured sheep,2 and Bharadvaja warns the gods of 

the presence of the Asuras in the Ukthas, and so saves them.3 Vasistha con strains the god Indra to show himself to him in bodily presence, and Indra must agree.4 Even if the gods seek to keep, as they sometimes do, knowledgefrom the seers, the latter triumph : they recognize that the gods have putthe sacrificial post in upside down, and they find the Nigadas and Praisas, whichthey had at first omitted. The seer also can rely on the gods to enable him to convince men of his seerhood : Kavasa Ailusa, despised by other priests, is shown to be a seer by the conduct of the Sarasvati, which pays him reverence by flowing round him :5 Vatsa walks triumphant through the fire, when his claim is disputed by Medhatithi. 

The mode of transmission of the knowledge of the rites explains why the ceremonial can be altered in important detail : the tradition is not established, and the theologians can discuss details even with royal personages, such as Janaka and A^vapati Kaikeya. We are actually told of points on which the great Yaj navalkya held opinions differing from the normal, but which he did not carry into effect.7 

In its aspect towards men the sacrifice is identical with the sacrificer, andit is identical also with the gods and with Prajapati. The sacrifice is essen tially commensurate with men, and the conclusion is not doubtfully drawnthat the sacrifice should be the sacrifice of man himself :8 lie owes debts, to the Fathers to produce a son, to the seers to recite the sacred texts, to menin the shape of hospitality, and to the gods he owes himself, just as Prajapati offered up himself. The conclusion would, therefore, appear to be that the perfect form of sacrifice should be suicide, but such an idea is not mentionedin the text of the Brahmanas, whether or not it existed then,9 as it in a sense certainly did in the Buddhist and Jain period. The idea, however, in its less developed form is expressed in various ways : the sap which is the essence of sacrifice is first in man, then it passes on to the other victims, the horse, the ox, the sheep, the goat, and even into the rice, which is thus not in itself worthy of sacrifice, but is still full of the sap of sacrifice.10 Again the consecra tion gives man a new and divine life, but it also means the handing over of his old body to the gods as an offering: this offeringis not, however, performed : it is redeemed by the offering to the victim to Agni and Soma, which follows, and of that victim one view is that the man should not eat, since it is a

460 The Philosophy ofthe Veda [Part vredemption of his own body.1 The human sacrifice is also permitted, not as suicide, but as a substitute for oneself, but this is a doctrine which has nodirect support in the Brahmanas, and may be a very late conception. Theoffering of man in the rite of the piling of the fire altar is recorded, but the sense of the redemptionof the self is not there pressed, though it receives a classical form in the legendof funahcepa, who is to serve as a substitute for the offering of the king'sson. Here, however, the motive of sacrifice is anordinary case of the vow of some precious object to a god.   

At the same time the sacrifice involves the death of the godin the form of the Soina 2 or the victim. In the former case every effort is made to conceal the fact of death from the god : he is assured that he is being pounded, not for the sake of his death, but to attain the overlordshipof the metres : 

or again one thinks, as one takes up the pressing stone, of one's enemy, andthus kills him and not the innocent Soma.3 The seller of the Soma is treated with insult and blows as an evil man, and the Soma himself is accorded the guest reception, as he moves to his death in the ritual. These remarks, how ever, show clearly enough no serious or real feelingfor the death of the god : they are products of speculation, not of deep religious conviction. 

The sacrifice itself is supposedto undergo a perpetualseries of deaths, andof coming again to life : in the etymology of the Brahmanas it is born throughmovement, hence it is yah-ja, which is as much as yajria.* The sacrifice is the cater, for it lives on all creatures,5 but at the same time it is the universal prin ciple of life.6 The libation offered in the fire is the life of the gods: the eating of the oblation by the priestsis the life of men : the placingof the Nfira^ansa cups on the oblation holders is the life of the Fathers. Aforetime, indeed, the gods and the men and the Fathers used to enjoythe sacrifice together, and still they do so, but the difference is that the gods and the Fathers are no longer seen by the mortal eyes.7 The gods depend essentially on the sacrifice : India is hungry, and goes and asks for a gift: courtesy is due to them, and, therefore, when they are on the next day to receive the sacrifice, men do not cat but last, since it would be discourteous to anticipate the feedingof the guests, who havebeen invited. The gods arc so anxious for the offering that they consider eagerly whether they are to receive the sacrifice, or if it is to go to others* They know beforehand the intention of man, for he resolves with his mind, thence the knowledge goesto the breath, thence to the wind, and the windwafts to the gods the news of the intention.8

sacrifice, regard men with some degreeof dislike and suspicion: there waseven a time when men and gods lived together, but the gods were wearied anddisgusted with the demands of men, who used always to ask them for whatthey wanted sans phrase* and therefore departed from the earth. It is the gods who have given men the evils of sleep, sluggishness, anger, hunger, love of dice and of women.2 The Rbhus, admitted indeed into the society of the gods, are disliked because of their human odour.3 Many are the devices adopted by the gods to prevent men following them into their immortality : they succeed in so far that an agreement with the god of death secures that men shall not attain immortality with their bodies.4 On the other hand menever strive to imitate the gods and adoptin the sacrifice the habits of the gods, that especially of preferring the rightside for the commencement of all rites as opposed to the left, which men are said to favour : the differences are of absurd detail.5 

'The aim of the sacrifice is the world of heaven : the sacrifice is the ship which bears the sacrificcr to that world, and the Brhat and Rathantara Simians arc the two rudders of the ship, which bears the sacrificer to the desired bourne. From another pointof view the sacrificer mounts to the heaven : he does this by the special mode of recitation adopted: first he performs the text prescribed, pausing at each quarter verse, thus attaining this world ; then by half verses, attaining the atmosphere ; then by three quarter verses, attaining the heaven ; and then he says the whole verse, thus winning firmly the sun. If, however, he stops here, then he will definitely lose the world of earth, and the sacrificer is not preparedto enjoy immortality, until he has lived a full life : so he reverses the process, and returns to earth again. The same idea appearsin the three steps of Visnu, which the sacrificer steps and thus wins the way to the heaven, but he also must take care to descend again.6 

For the priest a very importantrule must be noted : the sacrifice, as wehave seen, dies eternally, and is eternally renewed, but this renewal must be conditioned by the givingof the fees to the priests: the sacrifice goes to 

heaven, the fee accompanies it, and by holding fast to the fee the sacrificer goes also.7 The man who sacrifices, without giving fees, is reserved for a dread fate : on him the Aptyas wipe off the sin which was com municated to them, when Indra slew the three-headed son of Tvastr, Vicvarupa.8 

It is not only, however, by the sacrifice properthat the sacrificer attains the gods : the consecration is a process by which he is given new birth, andbecomes an embryo, his actions and his clothing being based on the comparison

of him with such an embryo. His ordinary body, on the other hand, as wehave seen, becomes an offering to the gods or by the gods. He himself is nowin a state of extraordinary power, being filled with the sacrifice : if men cat his food, they take a third of any evil in him, those who speakill of him a third, and the ants who bite him a third.1 

The motive which induces the sacrificer to sacrifice and to undergo the painful self-torment, which is necessitated by the rite of consecration, is the possession of faith, which the Kausltaki Brahmana 2 declares to be the source of the abiding character of the sacrifice. Now faith is clearlyallied to truth, 

and precision or truth is intimately associated with actual sight, as opposedto mere hearing : the principle of the Brahmanas places sight as the highest source of truth.3 Faith in the sacrifice by gods and men is attained only byhim who sacrifices with faith.4 Faith is, therefore, necessary in the sacrifice and also in the priest: if Vatsapii Bhalandana was at first denounced as a thief by the seers, they were confuted by his winning faith through dis covering the proper rite.5 A very odd story tells of the cows :6they started a session for the purpose of obtaining horns : they received them after ten months, but some, not satisfied, not showing true faith, insisted on completing the year, where they won rich food, but lost their horns. Brhaspati, the priest of the gods, wins their faith by his discovery of the properritual.7 The sacrificer must realize, if he is to prosper, the fixed truth of the rule that the gods receive the offering and he the benediction accompanying it.8 

The importance of faith is such that it renders the gods of no importance, for the man who has faith realizes that the sacrifice produces its results with out need of the gods. Atri is one of those whose deity is faith, raddhadeva : when he is in need he docs not appeal to heaven, but invents the properrite and disposes of his disabilities.9 The first father of men, Manu himself, is the believer in faith par excellence : his one aim is the sacrifice : with Ida as his daughter 10 he repeoples the world after the deluge, and he continues his long course of sacrifices even down to the point that he is anxious to sacrifice his own wife at the bidding of the demons, Trsta and Varutri, and has to be prevented from doing so by Indra, who induces him to let her go, when the fire had already been carried round her as a preliminaryto the slaughter. Butone version actually attributes to him the performanceof the sacrifice at the suggestion of Kilata and Akuli, the Asura priests.11 This faith in the sacrifice

Chap. 27] The Theory of the Sacrifice 463  

is encouraged by the long accounts givenof the men who flourished by the use, and by the still longerlists of things, which by the sacrifice can be achieved automatically for men by the priests. 

The need of faith is the more obvious in that the sacrificer at the sacrifice is hopelessly given up into the hands of the priests. He can by manipulation deprive him of his senses, of his life, of his wealth, of his kingdom ; if he thinks of him as he says the Vasat call, he hurls upon him the thunderbolt which is contained in that call. The situation is repeatedly developedthat the sacrificer may be hated by the priest, and the priest is then instructed howto ruin him : the idea that this is wrong is absolutely derided. But, even if the priest is honest, the sacrifice is a dread thing, a dangerous wild beast, which must be propitiated: the gods themselves suffered terrible mischief by imprudence : Ptisan's teeth were knocked out, Savitr's hands cut off to bereplaced with golden ones, and Bhaga lost his eyesight.1 The priest Bhalla veya made an error in the sacrifice : he fell and broke his arm.2 Asfulhi Sau^romateya thought fit to substitute heads picked up anywhere for the five heads of the victims to be slain at the buildingof the fire altar, and paidfor it by his life.3 The priest is, therefore, a person, who has difficult tasks to perform, and whose services should not be despised: the effect of any offer ing is definite and precise, and it is idle to seek success in any haphazardmanner. 

The reward of the sacrificer for his efforts is, in the long run, one in the world to come : he may gain many desired things by the sacrifice and its manipulations in the present life, but these things are incidentals in the mainofferings, a point in which they distinguish themselves from the occasional offerings, and from magic performances generally. The sacrifice is reduced in a sense to mere magic by the priests, but it is a performance which, unlike a magic rite or an offering set on foot for some definite object, must be per formed regularly, and in it the profit acquired in this life is incidental, while the essential reward lies in the world to eome. But this reward of immortality there is not to be construed in the sense that man should seek by an early death to obtain the world to come : on the contrary, in that world his placewill be the better, the longer he lives : it is the aim of man not merely to achieve im mortality, as eternal life hereafter, but also the full age of a hundred years, which is the allotted span of man. Those who die under twenty years of age by a weird conceptionattain as their abode the days and the nights, those under forty the half months, those under sixty the months, those under eighty the seasons, those under a hundred the year, and those over a hundred years the boon of immortality.4 The oppositeof immortality is the repeated death,

Punarmrtyu,1 of which men are in deep fear. The idea isr that the passing oncethrough death is not enough : even after death, when man is in enjoymentof the precious boon of immortality, he may be robbed of it, and have once again to face the terrors of dissolution, of which the Vedic Indian shows him self most deeply afraid. The idea of a second death is, however, that of a second death in the future life, not of rebirth on earth and death in the ordinary sense, and the conception obviously could lend itself to the idea that the death might be not once only, but for numberless occasions : though the idea is actually found in the atapatha Brahmana, where a distinction is madebetween those born for immortality after death in the world to come, andthose born after death only to fall again and again into the power of death,2 nevertheless the ordinary conception is merely that of a repetition of death. Moreover it must not be forgotten that this idea occurs in the later Brah manas such as the Kausitaki and the atapatha.3 

The dead man, according to the agreement made by the gods with death, is not permitted to enter into immortality with his mortal body, which must belaid aside first. The way to the heaven despite that fact is even then not easy ; the Adityas*among others seek to keep back those who aim at heaven, andin addition there are en route two fires which try to burn up those whom they should burn, but let pass those whom they ought to let pass.5 In what mannerthe discrimination is made nothing is said, and, as we have seen, there is noother trace of the doctrine of a divine judgement in the Vedic literature. Beyond these powers, however, the dead is subject to the power of the sun, which is death : all creatures below it are subject to death, those above are free. The sun owes its positionin the heaven to the gods who established it there, and keep it from falling away from its high place. The sun indeed for a time did not appreciate the high honour thus paid: he returned to earth, butfound it in the clutches of death : he therefore praised Agni, and won again his home in the heaven.6 The just men are the rays of the sun, and the con stellations are appropriatedto those good men who go to the world of heaven.7 

The dead, however, do not always go to the gods : they may also go to the Fathers, who dwell in the third heaven. The difference of the ways is notexplained, and remains as mysterious as the Fathers themselves. Of themdiverse accounts are given : they are the children of Prajapati, born before the gods and after the Asuras ; they are the gods, who were slain in the fight with Vrtra, brought to life as the Fathers.8Incorporeal, they are comparedto mind,9 as they cannot be seen. They correspond to the seasons, inter

mediate between the day, which is appropriate to man, and the year of the gods : they correspond to the world of the atmosphere which comes betweenthe earth and the heaven, but their world is not there. With the gods theyhave been at variance : their chief Yama l used to deprive the gods of all that they had, until the intervention of Prajapati led to the settlement ofthe dispute. The gods are compelled to share with the Fathers the sacrifice. To their worshippers they are a somewhat dreaded band :2they must be appeased byofferings of the fringe of one's garment up to the age of fifty, and thereafter demand the offering of hair : their approach in the later period becomes, closer and the need to buy off their demands by the redemption of oneself increases. When they come, it is said the Fathers take a man or they give one.3 They are also to be honoured by the sacrificer turning away his head, whenthey come to eat, even as the prince eats without the gaze of the people.4 They receive offerings for many reasons,5 to prevent their bringing death with them, to carry out the rule of following the usages of the gods who offered to them, to show benevolence to those whom the gods recalled to life, to elevate the sacrificer's own Fathers to a better world, and to make good the injuries which one inflicts on oneself by misconduct. 

Of quite special interest among these speciilationsis the theory of thepiling of the sacred fire, which has peculiarities of its own and deserves, there fore, special consideration.6 The building of the fire altar, as we have seen, is no ordinary part of the ritual : it is not an essential part perhaps of anysacrifice at all, and it is perfectly clear that the elaboration of the performancemeant that it was one to be undertaken only occasionally, and then by a rich noble or prince or Brahman. The essence of the pilingis clearly mystic : it has the purpose of carrying out in ritual form the essential act of the recon struction of Prajapati, whose sacrifice as Purusa has resulted in the creation of the universe in all its parts. This sacrifice cannot be regarded as a single definite act in time : it is rather a constant process, and therefore the dis membered god must ever and again be renewed. The renewal is broughtabout by the reconstruction of Prajapati in the shape of the fire altar. Themass of significant members connected in the ritual is noteworthy : the godhimself is not merely identified with Purusa as is natural, but he is identical with Agni as fire : the identification is carried out in detail : the fire altar is a year in building, and the fire-pan which the sacrificer has is for a year carried about by him. The bricks for the altar are prepared while preparation is made

of the fire-pan. The altar is arranged to represent earth, atmosphere, andheaven, and the same arrangement is devised in the fire-pan. The relations between Prajapati and Agni are not absolutely simple: Prajapatiis the father of Agni, but also the son, since Agni restores him by the sacrifice, and the fire altar is the body of Agni, through which Prajapatiis built up. Agni is also the child of the waters which in their turn are created by Praja pati and in the fire altar there is laid at the bottom a lotus leaf from whichAgni is born. The bird shape of the fire altar is also often referred to as well as the mortal shape: the bird shape is clearly connected with the myth of Agni in lightning form bringing down the Soma from the sky: the Soma,moreover, as the sacrifice par excellence, is, as was inevitable, identified with Prajapati. The bird altar has, however, another aspect: the bird is to fly to the sky as the sacrifice, and with the bird the sacrificer who is identified with Prajapati is to attain the sky.1 In the piling of the altar the symbolism;s carried out in the form of the gold disk, a symbol of the sun, which is placed over the lotus, and over which again is placedthe golden image of a man,above whom lie in the first, third, and fifth layers of the pile the three naturally perforated bricks, representing the three worlds, through which the golden man can breathe, and through which the sacrificer must rise to the sun. Thesymbolism is effective : the ideas of the sun, the god Agni, the all-creator, andthe sacrificer, as identical, and the nature of the sacrifice as leadingto the world of heaven, are as efficiently produced by the ritual, as can be well conceived. 

The ritual as it is seen in the texts of the Black Yajurveda docs not seem to go beyond these conceptions, but the atapatha Brahmana in the tenth book,2 doubtless a later addition to the text, which deals with the secret of the fire, develops the theme more philosophically. Prajapatiis the year, for he

is essentially, as the creator, time, and the year is at once the symbol of time, and the period in which the working of nature completes a round, and com mences again. The year of the piling of the altar, and the carrying of the fire in the fire-pan by the sacrificer, has been already mentioned : the year is symbolic also of birth : Agni must be borne for a year in the fire-pan before he is brought to life as the fire on the altar itself. In the acts of carrying himin the pan the sacrificer takes Agni into himself and in the fullness of time he brings him forth from himself, in accordance with the doctrine that the father of Agni is Prajapati, the sacrificer himself. But the fact that Prajapatiis

essence of the rite, but though he justly insists on the non-popularcharacter of the belief, he does not disprove the view of Eggeling, which is strongly supported by the fatapatha.

time, and that the sacrifice! is identical with Prajapati as time, has another andimportant side : the effect of time must be that, even if a man attain, as the piling of the altar will aid him to attain, the full life of a hundred years, still he must die, and he dies thus as death itself by his own hands, passing from the realm of material existence and its troubles and limitations to the eternal andabiding happiness of the life to come.1 But the Brahmana goes further than this and attributes to andilya the doctrine that the ultimate essence of Prajapati, of the sacrificer, and therefore of the universe, is mind, from whichdevelop speech, the breath, the eye, the ear, work, fire. The final realityis summed up as the self, made up of intelligence, with a body of spirit, a formof light, and an ethereal nature, which pervades the regions and upholds the universe, though devoid of speech and mental affects. Or, again, it is said that the Purusa in the heart is as a grain of rice or granule of millet ; like smokeless light, it is greater than the heaven, the atmosphere, and the earth, than all existing things: the self of the spiritis the self of man, and on passing away from life he attains that self. The changed spirit of the speculation in the course of time cannot be better illustrated than by this view, for the Taittiriya Samhita holds closely to the material view that the result of the offering in the next world is to secure the sacrificer his self and his breath there in. The continuance as nearly as possiblein the same condition as before of the existence on earth is the ideal of the Samhita : it has been transmuted bythe wisdom of andilya2 into a conception which seeks in its grand mannerto solve the questionof the existence of the universe and of the individual, byfinding in them both the expression of a single spiritual principle. The im pression of later growth thus engendered is supported, and made beyondreasonable doubt, not merely by the evidence of language, but by the fact that it is precisely this book of the atapatha which gives us the conceptionof the repetition, not once merely, of death in the world to come.3 The philo sophy of the Brahmanas is merging into that of the Upanisads. 

1 This connexion of birth and the year may or twenty-eight days in the popular conceivably be due to the old view reckoning is counter to the fact that apparently Indo-European of the birth is placed in the tenth month, year of ten months of gestation, which not at the end, so that his month is may be found in the Rigveda as in too short. Probably the thirty-day ancient Rome. Buddhist tradition month is all that is meant. Buddha is insists on ten months preciselyas the clearly a miraculous child, period of his stayin the womb (Win 2 fB. x. C. 4. 

disch, Buddha's Geburt, pp. 120 ff.) ;3 Lindenau's suggestion (ZII. i. 48, n. 2) Hopkins ( JAOS. xxiv. 19, 392) thinks that AV. xiii. 3. 7 enunciates, as regards references to the year are only periods Rohita, the doctrine of the necessary within which, which would prove mortality of the highest being, so far as 

nothing for a ten months' year. His involved in the empiric world, rests on view that the month is twenty-seven a dubious translation.

468 The Philosophy of the Veda [Part v  

4. The Ethics ofthe Brahmanas 

In the strict sense of the word there is no theoryof ethics in the Brahmanaliterature : the question of the nature of right action does not seem ever to havein any degree influenced the speculations of the curious spirits which framed the remarkable theory of which the outlines have been sketched above. It was, indeed, natural that the first element of the speculative thought of India should in the main be directed to problems of pure speculation, as was also the case in Greece, but the dominating feature in the philosophyof India is that the question of right conduct never attained the dignityof a subject to bepropounded for serious consideration. In the Rigveda, while the hymns of creation and the other efforts to arrive at a philosophical account of the universe have beside them the expression in the hymns to Varuna of the pre valence of moral order and the punishment of sin, the latter conception cannotbe found in living force any longerin the Brahmanas, a fact which has un wisely been used as a proofthat early India was exposedto Semitic influences later not felt.1 

The contrast here between Indian and Iranian development in religious matters becomes marked. Almost contemporaneously, perhaps, with the development of the thought of the Brahmanas, we find Zoroaster engaged in deepening the meaning of religion for the people of Iran and founding a reasoned ethical system. While Varuna was losing ground in India, Zoroaster was developing the figure of Ahura Mazdah, and depriving him of a rival bydegrading Indra, his most serious competitor,as the god of war, to the rankof a demon.2 At the same time he removed from the character of the godany suspicion of uncertainty or caprice, such as still clings in the Rigveda to Varuna, whose noose and whose punishments appear to afflict at times even the innocent, and who is lord of a Maya, which may be harmful as well as beneficent. Further, to Zoroaster the powers of evil loomed far greater thanthey had done to the early Aiyan mind, which, as in the Rigveda, knowsindeed demons in abundance, but has no doubt in the power of the gods to overcome them, nor indeed of its own ability to win the favour of the gods, Vrtra may be terrible, but he is never victorious, even if it would be unkind to assert that the Vedic demons exist merely for the gods to slay. Zoroaster accepts the impossibility of explaining the evil in the world, if it be assumedthat Ahura is all-mighty, and that all has been created by him at his pleasure. On the contrary, the spirit of evil contends against the good, and only after desperate struggles can good be made to prevail. Moreover, in that struggle

each man is free and morally bound to participate ; it lies with him to further the conquest of evil ; the deeds which he does are not merely personal ; theyserve to further the constant struggle of good against evil, and have cosmic value. Moreover, by his deeds does a man decide his future fate, in heaven or hell ; the intervention of divine favour is excluded ;l the soul of the deadfinds the Cinvat bridge wide or hopelessly narrow, accordingas his good or evil deeds prevail. Deeds, moreover, are essentially matters of practical utility and activity ; prayers and offerings play their part, but the ideal of Zoroaster is the man who founds a family, performs his duties in his tribe, andfurthers agriculture, performing useful works, as opposed to the nomad,who is the personification of the lie (druj). 

It may be that the stern conditions of life in Iran, where cultivation canbe maintained only by unceasing toil, and the agriculturist must ever fear the incursions of the nomad, played a definite part in evoking the /oroastrian outlook, nor, of course, must be ignored the individual character of his teaching, which never was fully assimilated in Iran, but was on the one hand exagge rated and made absurd by the pedantic and cruel pursuit of detail, and on the other hand contaminated by the reintroduction of much of the old nature worship of Iran.2 In India under different conditions of climate and life andracial admixture, thought turned to speculation rather than to action, andinclined to sec unity,in lieu of regarding life as a struggle between the goodand the bad. This contrast interposedfor Zoroaster essential difficulties in regarding the world as a single whole, animated by one spirit ; in India this was possible, and an absolute came to be recognized in which all was contained, whether good or bad, material or spiritual. Parallel with this movement wasnecessarily the decline from power of Varuna. Indra, as the god of the warrior and the people, remained powerful and popular : recent research, indeed, has shown how much alive, if in humble guise, he is to-day in northern India ;3 first Prajapati, and then the Brahman absorbed the metaphysical elements of Varuna's nature, while the growth in popularity of Yama as king oi' the dead limited his chthonian functions,4so that the god who once was the chief guardian of the Rta sank to the function of lord of waters, which was his by right as a sky god, and which no other deity arose to wrest from him. Similarly the conceptionof the Rta passes away before the prevalenceof the Brahman. 

The development which places the Brahman in the first place is notachieved until the Upanisads, but it is in preparation during the period of the Brahmanas, and it is in entire harmony with this spirit that these texts do

not develop any theory of morality.1 Indeed they do not normally inculcate morality even on merely empiric grounds. The myths which they recount andinvent have this characteristic about them, that they are indifferent to the moral qualities of the acts : the gods are willing to commit sins freely for their own gain : they obtain the aid of the Raksases against the Asuras, and then they refuse to carry out their bargain to share equally with the former in the event of victory attending their united efforts. They are not ashamed to purchase the Soma from the Gandharvas by means of Vac, on the clear agree ment arrived at between her and them that she will return to them when in vited. They win speech from the Asuras by the low arts of solicitation and of dancing and singingin opposition to the pious recitation of the Veda by their rivals. They are constantly jealous of men, whom they refuse to allow to share with them the happiness of immortality without laying aside the corporeal body in death. But compared with Indra they are comparatively virtuous people : he, however, is quite unashamed : he makes a compact with Namuci and sets about to find a way of violating it, which he does with success : his murder of Viyvarupa, son of Tvastr, is unmotived and wicked, and brings on him the guilt of slaying a Brahman. His amour with Ahalyais only accomplished by means of deceiving the lady by adopting the form of her husband,2 and he gave over to the hyenas certain ascetics, an impure(amedhya) act.3 His adultery4 is repaid in kind ; for his own son, born of his thigh, Kutsa Aurava, takes advantage of his physical likeness, to win the favour of aci Paulomni, his father's wife. But, after all, what could be moredegrading than the pictures of him hungry and begging a priest for an offering, and then running about cake in hand, or bound by cords by Kutsa and urged by Lu$a to break away from this degrading servitude ?5 Even his own sub jects, the Maruts, he plunders, justifying the royal habit of accepting loot plundered from the husbandmen. Prajapati appears as committing incest, and as adopting in the course of it an animal form, which is slain by the wrathof the gods concentrated in the form of Rudra,6 and in one rite he is formally reviled. The other gods are constantly jealous of one another ; they haveseparate dwellings, and are moved by envy of one another rather than by love and friendship. The Vratyas insult Vayu and l^ana, who bar the world of heaven to them, but are shown it by Prajapati.7 The gods are essentially selfish ; they give men the six evils of sleep, sloth, anger, hunger, love of dicing and of women.

It is the case that the godsare said to be essentially true,1 but the nature of the truth is not vitally moral : it is strictly confined to the precise carrying out of the rites and utterance of the formulae of the sacrificial ritual. Just as man's faith is not in the goodnessof the gods, but in the efficacy of the sacrifice, if duly performed,so truth has no real moral content and in intellectual out look is limited to the sacrifice, which, it must be admitted, is the reality parexcellence for the Brahmans. But even this truth was not always the posses sion of the gods : as children of Prajapati, the gods and the Asuras shared the patrimony of the father, which was Vac : they then indifferently spoketruth and falsehood : finally the gods abandoned the use of anything but truth, and the Asuras that of anything but falsehood. The gods, however, by saying nothing but the truth became feeble and impoverished,while by the opposite device the Asuras prosperedlike salt, the Indian equivalentof the green baytree. But in the end the truth prevailed over the untruth, mainly, it wouldseem, because by the consecration offering, which they invented, the gods extended truth and made it more effective.2 The moral apparently, therefore, is that in the long run exactitude in the sacrifice must prevail. 

The sense of the importanceof exactitude in the rite is seen in the famousritual of confession which is performedat the Varunapraghasas, when the priest, the Pratiprasthatr, asks the wife of the sacrificer with whom she consorts, other than her husband.3 It is essential that she should confess, since else it will go badly with her kinsfolk, an interesting assertion of the solidarity of the kin. The speaking out of the sin diminishes it, but not, it appears, by anythingelse than that it brings exactitude againinto the order of things : the wife commits an offence against Varuna, in that being the wife of one she consorts with another : the statement of the true fact removesthe inexactitude, and repairsin so far the defect. It brings truth, i.e. reality, and order into the rite.4 The position of Varuna in this regardis of importance as it indicates in what degree the high conceptionof the Varuna of the Rig vcda has been degraded by the passageof time and the growing preference for the sacrifice. He is not regardedin the ritual, as it stands, as morethan the power which resents the introduction of irregularity into the facts of the universe. 

The position of Varuna in this regardis also of interest on another ground : in the Brahmanas Vamna is essentially a god of the waters, and this con nexion of truth or reality and the waters must be traced to this relation. Hiranyadant Baida6 is quotedas asserting that heaven rests on the atmo sphere, the atmosphere on the earth, the earth on the waters, the waters 1 AB. i. 6. 7 ; KB. ii. 8 ; MS. i. 9. 3 ; B. meant death.

472 The Philosophy ofthe Veda [Partv   

on truth, truth on the Brahman, and the Brahman on fervour. The waters are, it must be remembered, the primeval elements, they are a fact and theyare also based on fact, on truth. The waters are also the conceptionof law : when the waters come to this earth, then all is in due and lawful order : whenthere is lack of rain, the stronger oppresses the weaker.1 The waters are also the reality itself,2 they are immortality,3 they are faith,4they are the sacrifice.5 Man must use them to sprinkle himself with water, in order to becomeritually pure. The performanceof the bath provides even consecration andfervour, for the gods placedconsecration in the waters.6 Moreover, the sap of the sacrifice is in the waters and by it they flow.7 The impuritiesof men donot affect the waters themselves, in accordance with the pact they made with the gods. The Darbha grass owes its power to the presencein it of the waters. The waters arc as a thunderbolt, and they must be propitiated with suitable words to avoid injury by them. They are extremely powerful to destroy the Raksases,8 and they are, therefore, benevolent if managed well : they form the atonement 9 for every harsh deed in the sacrifice, and on the other hand, whenappeased, they confer glory and power on the king at the royal consecration. 

But the identification of the waters with truth or realityis not the only identification : the earth is also truth, for it is of all the worlds the mostobviously genuine.10 Gold againis reality ; lead, being neither iron nor gold, is a mere appearance.11 Truth, therefore, is nothing but a species of existence, which the term used, Satya, also properly expresses. But the most important side remains ritual accuracy: the best pairis the union of faith and truth as ritual accuracy.12 The sacrifice is formally identified with the truth, and so is the threefold Veda, and the Brahman as holy writ, to which conception wemust refer the doctrine of Hiranyadant Baida that truth rests 011 the Brahman.More simply, however, the rite is simplefact : the eyeis asserted to be truth, because, unlike the mind and speech,it is not prone to give false witness. From this fact, however, there is deduced a doctrine of some value for the guidance of the sacrifieer : as in the case of the wife and her lovers, he mustsee that in the rite he shall duly bringhimself into harmony with the truth by the use of true speech.13 When he is about to undertake a vow, he should realize that he passes from the inaccuracy of ordinary life to the exactitude, which is characteristic in ritual of the god, and, at the end when he lays downthe vow, he ceases to be under the bond of accuracy. But in the rite he docs not say so openly :14 he contents himself with the declaration that he is once more as he was that is one who lives among men, whose nature is inaccuracy.

A difficulty, however, arises in practice: if the rule of truth is laid downabsolutely as incumbent always on him who has established the sacred fires, what will happen to him ? What man can always speak the truth ? ArunaAupave9i, when urgedto establish his fires, put the point plainly that he wasbeing condemned by this instruction to silence, as no one could avoid speaking what was false.1 

In the view of Oldenberg,2 truth denotes something more than mereaccuracy, and it is probablethat there is justicein this contention, if it is not pressed too hard. It is characteristic of this period3 that the terms Satya andAnrta come to form a formal contrast. As we have seen, in the Rigvedait is impossible to accept the view that Rta and Satya, order and truth, are identical,4 and it would probably be erroneous to assume that the contrast of Satya and Anrta denoted that in this period the term Anrta had lost any con nexion with the idea of order and righteousness.It may perhaps be said that, while Anrta tends to be weakened into meaning no more than falsehood, Satyatakes on an additional tinge of value5 and it is certain that Rta still meansorder, though here and there6 it is tempting, but probably misleading, merelyto render it'truth '. 

Varuna is the deity who is constantly ready to punishinaccuracies in the ritual : his cords and his knots make him admirably lit for this purpose, andthe errors in the offering are at once seized hold of by him. By sacrificing in the southern lire, the sacrificer secures the seizing by Varuna of his rival, but the offering if made on the Ahavanlya would entail the same fate for the sacrificer himself.7 Visnu, on the other hand, repairs the errors of the sacri fice, and does not seize on them as the time for assailing the author of the mistakes.8 If the rule that a father should not be transgressed against is asserted, and traced to Prajapati's offspring being punished by Varuna for transgress against him, it is at once found that the transgress was a ritual one.9 In Varuna's house when the gods make mutual pledgeof loyalty at the Taimnaptra they deposittheir forms : here again the act is a ritual performance.10 

But the most convincing evidence of all regarding the almost purelyritual character of goodness in the view of the Brahmanas is the fact that their conception of torment in the other world is inextricably bound up with the correct practice, or the failure to follow the correct practice, of the ritual. 1 AB. i. 6. 6 ;B. ii. 2. 2. 20.

474 The Philosophy ofthe Veda [Part V  

After death man is weighed in the balance to test the good and the bad, an idea which is evidently not a primitive speculation but a late develop ment,1suggested, it may be, by the ordeal of the balance which is knownin the later literature : it is, however, at least possible that the idea is no more than one of the passing conceptionsof the Brahmanas, possibly a faint echo of the Iranian conceptionof judgement.2 But we cannot for a moment assume that the distinction depends on ordinary morality. Thereal nature of the idea is shown by the story of Bhrgu,son of Varuna, whowas so proud that the god for his improvement made him unconscious andsent his spirit to see the world to come. Of the sights seen by Bhrgu there are two versions preservedin the atapatka3 and the Jaiminlya Brahmanas :4 according to the latter, he first saw a man devouring another man whom he had cut up in pieces ; in the second place he saw a man who was eating another while the latter uttered cries of misery ; in the third place he saw a man whowas eating another, who, however, keptentire silence ;in the fourth place he saw two womenguardinga treasure ; and in the fifth place two rivers, one of blood guarded by a naked man armed with a mace, and one of butter guarded by men of gold, who with cupsof gold draw from it what they desire. Then hesaw, last of all, five rivers covered with lotuses blue and white, with waves of honey, where the dance, the song, and the lute resounded, where Apsarases disported themselves, and sweet fragrance was wafted. The atapatha version differs in detail : Varuna sends Bhrgu simply on a journey to cure him of pride : he visits the four cardinal points and one of the intermediate spaces. He sees only five instead of six sights, and these five are reduced to four by the fact that the first is really reduplicated, the first being the vision of men who were cutting in pieces and the second of men who were cutting only. The two rivers of blood and of butter, and the five of goldare omitted in toto, and the nude man figures in the episodeof the two damsels. Theexplanation of these visions is givento the chastened Bhrgu by his father Varuna : the first exhibits the fate of those men who, without offering the Agnihotra and without true knowledge,cut wood in the world : the trees take thus revenge on them in the world to come ; the second is the fate of men whowithout proper ritual knowledge kill and eat animals ; the third applies in the case of eatingherbs. The other three visions are faith and lack of faith respectively ; the river of blood is the blood of a Brahman, the black man is the sacrifice, the river of butter is formed from the waters used at the offering ; the five rivers are the worlds of Varuna. If a man performsthe due offering, the trees in the world to come do not eat him, nor animals, nor rice and barley: his offerings go neither to faith or lack of faith : he avoids the river of blood, hegains the river of butter. The same idea appearsin the Kausitaki Brahmaria5

also : the animals revenge themselves on man in the next world, unless headopts the proper form of rite. 

A final proof of the brutal morality of the priest can be adduced in the position assigned to women : woman in India has always suffered much fromall religions,1 but by none has she been so thoroughly despised as by the Brahmans of the period of the Brahmanas. The insolence of the question at the Varunapraghasas has been noted : however much it may be explained away, it remains an insult, since it can only be justified on the theory that infidelity in a wife is not surprising ; a priestlike Yavakri takes toll of every woman lie fancies at pleasure. The wife is the half of man,2 but this is merely due to the fact that, without her, the man cannot secure the essential off spring to continue his family, and perform the offerings to him after death. The Maitrayam Samhita3 is very outspoken in its view of women : the three things which are connected with Nirrti,'Dissolution ', are dice, women, andslumber : the reality is the sacrifice, women is lack of truth. Three invitations addressed in a loving tone will overcome the most circumspect women, andtheir bad taste prefers the dance and song to the recitation of the Veda.4 Their power of wheedling secrets out of their husband is referred to in con temptuous terms.5 As compared with men they are always inferior : womanis the inferior part of the sacrifice : she is ritually impure, and must be covered with a girdle.6 They have been smitten by the gods with the thunderbolt of the butter and hence they are emasculated, they cannot control themselves or an inheritance :7 even if many women arc together and there is but a small boy, he takes precedence of them all.8 They are inferior even to a bad man,9 and their inferiorityis marked by the ceremony on birth when the child is brought to the father.10 

On the other hand, it would be wholly unfair to ignore the fact that the Brahmanas do not encourage or contemplate many crimes, which have beencommitted in other rituals. The exposure of female children which has been asserted to be mentioned in the Brahmanas is a mere error.11 The Brahmanas, further, never actually prescribe a human sacrifice : the tradition of such anoffering in the piling of the fire altar is handed down, and the name of the last sacrificer is given, but, though the Brahmana 12 docs not show any profound horror at the past, and may possibly have regretted the change, it must beremembered that this rite was always a rare and exceptional one.

slaughter of animals was, of course, prescribed by the rite, but the use of animals for food was the basis of this slaughter, and the doctrine of Ahinsa is one which has never even in India received full sanction. The accusation of cruelty in the slayingof the victim, which has often been brought against religious rites, is not specially proved for the Brahmanas : the primitive means of slaying victims available probably caused suffering to the animals, as in the Jewish practice of to-day, but that there was any deliberate lack of humanity is contrary to the desire of the sacrificers to avoid anything un seemly, which might indicate the reluctance of the victim to depart from the world. The Omophagiaof the Dionysiac rites is not in the slightest degree hinted at in the Indian sacrifice. 

The ritual admittedly contains several rites based on fertility magic, which to modern taste are revolting, and sometimes even horrible, such as the action of the queenat the horse sacrifice. The idea that these rites were invented by the Brahmans, as is suggested even by Victor Henry,1 must be rejected as an error : the beliefs so expressedare primitive and natural, not priestly, and the only action of the priestsin regard to them was doubtless the adoption from the popularbelief of these usages and their decoration with the literature of the priests.2 Even in regard to these usages it is fair to note that there arose among the priests a disinclination to performthe ritual. 

In the faiikhayana Qrauta Sutra3 there is recorded the view that the rite, bywhich a pair, or pairs, in the course of the Mahavrata at the winter solstice went through the processof intercourse, oughtnot to be performed, whether because it was antiquatedor too extensive is uncertain. That such a view should have been taken in the face of the prescription of the rite in all the ancient texts 4is creditable and worthy of notice. It is only to be regretted that it stands almost alone, for the omission in certain texts of the rite of beating the king on the occasion of the royal consecration may be explained otherwise. 

Moreover, we must admit that the ritual books show sometimes the mostunedifying indifference to morality. The Jaiminiya Brahmana5actually records, without disapproval apparently, a rite, the Gosava, in which the per former pays the ox the complimentof imitatingits mode of existence, including incest with mother, sister, and female relative, though it records

that Janaka of Videha did not carry out the rite, when he understood its nature, and the ibi king, who did, concluded that it was a ritual which should be performed in old age only, when the action it prescribed might be moreexcusable in certain regards. The priestly nature of the rite as it stands is shown by the reward promised, the world of the Ox, a reference to that creature in its Atharvanl form as a cosmic equivalent of Prajapati. Not less brutal is the cynical rite2provided when a man desires his wife to have lovers in plenty during his absence from her side. 

A more favourable view of the morality of the Brahmanas is taken byHopkins,3 who holds that, while in the case of the Paricavin^a the Saman andthe rite make the gist of the Brahmana's religion,it remains true that there is a real ethical foundation for this religion. The evidence adduced, however, is scanty ; untruth is indeed reproved, and the'hant'follows the slayer, while taking too much is like swallowing poison.4 But the sacrifice does awaywith sin automatically ; even a sinner by means of wealth gets to the top ; goods wrongly accepted can thus be made proper and lit.5 The conception of sin is mechanical : all slaying, even of demons such as Vrtra, brings the taint of bloodshed, whether justified or not, the fault of the sacrifice passes to him who blames it, as does a third of the sin of the initiated to any one whospeaks ill of them.tt Evil repute (axilla vac) fastens on every killer, irrespective of the nature of his deed. A false accusation makes a man, despite his inno cence, avoided by the gods, but the priests can make his sacrifice acceptable to them, and it is wisely said that the false accusers are the real sinners.7 Untruth is described as a hole in the voice which can be filled by addinga syllabic to a verse.8 We find also the dubious doctrine9 of' sins caused by the gods, by the Fathers, by other men or by ourselves ', which the com mentator explainsas evils inflicted by the gods or Fathers in respect of neglect, but not with certain accuracy. Moreover, insistence is laid on the fact that sacrifice increases proportionately man's welfare materially andspiritually.10 

The Brahmana, however, contains one doctrine of interest,11 intended to explain the fact of the grief (fo/ra) which is the lot of the harlot, the eunuch, and the sinner. It adapts the old doctrine of the grief of the earth and skyon parting ; Indra removes grief from the earth into the harlot, from the atmosphere, which is the weakest of the worlds,12 to the eunuch, and from the sky to the sinner ; hence their desires are unattainable, and, even if oneobtains some part of desire, he attains also a portionof grief.

478 The Philosophy of the Veda [Partv   

The association of purely ritual acts with morality is conspicuous even in the Upanisads,1 and it is not surprising that the Brahmanas remain in hopeless ignorance of the specific character of morality. As in the sphere of the sacrifice, we find confusion of the ideas of divine intervention and magic

operation. Thus Varuna seizes the doer of evil, and therefore, since the evening is Varuna's time, one should then on no account utter falsehood.2 But, having spoken truth in the evening, it makes no difference how muchfalsehood one speaks thereafter ; the original truth, appliedat the proper moment, continues to have, we may say, an abiding and dominant effect.3 Untruth and impurity can be washed away by water, or wiped away by appli cation of the sacred Darbha grass.4 The same independence of morality is seen in the new doctrine of the fruit of ritual works, independent of divine action, and the view that man is born into the world hereafter which he has made for himself.6 The germ of the ideas lies in the gifts and sacrifices (isfapiirta) of the Rigveda with which one is united in the world to come, without any divine intervention. We have here a germ whence later appears the conception of the automatic working of Karman. 

One idea of importance, however, can be faintly traced. Impurity, of course, is largely ritual, and a new-born child is ritually impure.6 On the other hand, we find it definitely asserted that if one perform a certain ceremony of purification one will be left with no more guilt than is in a toothless child, and

a similar assertion is made of a child on birth.7 These assertions clearly admitthat sin is not to be ascribed to a being incapable of volition, and in the samestrain .of thought we have the assertion of the sin which accrued to Somabecause he had merely the intention of oppressing the Brahmans.8 But these are isolated utterances, we have no reason to suppose that there was recognized any general doctrine of the necessity of volition to create responsibility ; the opposite clearly appears from the tale of the charioteer who by inadver tence killed a Brahman boy, for the discussion of the incident deals only with the point whether the charioteer, or his master who was ridingin the chariot, was to bear the sin of the slaughter.9 

In the terminology10 of the Brahmanas, however, appear differentiations

from the uses of the Rigvedawhich attest the development of moral concep tions. The conceptionof Rta as righteousness,as has been seen, is less pro minent ; but the term itself in the negative form, Anrta, has established itself as the opposite of truth, Satya, which largely supersedes Rta. The old conception of law, Dharman, persists, but there appearsbeside it the later formation Dharma, which the atapatha Brahmanaxformally personifies. The king now is hailed as the guardianof the Dharma and to him who has the power men resort in matters of Dharma,2 whence later we have the DharmaSutras with their inextricable mixture of ritual, of domestic practices, and of civil and criminal law, all matters which Dharma is wide enough to cover. Vrata in the Rigveda denotes either the will of the god, or the usage of the manwho obeys that will, nor docs it cease to have this sense in the Brahmanas, for the committer of a breach of the established moral laws can be called one whoturns from Vrata (apavrata)? But it tends to be specialized to denote the course of observance specially undertaken by an individual for some special purpose, and the Brahmanas, like the Upanisads and the Sutras, know of manycurious Vratas. 

There is developmentalso in the terms for good and evil. The old wordsVasu and ri 4 continue to denote material prosperity, the earlier sense of the latter term as appropriateto beauty becoming less and less prominent, andthe wicked man is still Papa. But from its use with terms of motion Sadhucomes to denote what is right,5 and Punya slowly develops,in lieu of its purely unethical sense of 'fortunate' or*lucky', the implicationof goodness,6 as evinced in prosperity. Both terms are fated to have an important develop ment later, for they are used in those passagesof the Upanisads which touch on the essential connexion of the position of man in life as affected by the merit or demerit of his deeds in a previousbirth.7 

But though terminology shows a certain advance in view, it remains the case that nothing architectonic arises in the way of conceptionof good and evil. Truth and falsehood are sometimes set against each other, and once truth, good fortune, and light are opposedto untruth, evil, and darkness. But wemiss entirely even what might have been expected, a living effort to combinethe opposition of gods and Asuras with the conceptionof good and evil. Goodsremain essentially mundane ; the prayersoffered are especiallyfor temporal things, prosperity for the crops, the cattle, the boon of children, harmony in the realm, or pre-eminencefor the Brahmans, or the restoration of an exiled

king, acuteness of the senses, and rarely the world of heaven.1 Occasionally the idea appears that all objects of human desire are of minor importance ; the chariot of the gods is yoked for the world of heaven, that of men for meredesires. Similarly knowledge is stated to attain a result which neither gifts to the priest nor asceticism can obtain.2 But this is not the prevailing idea, nor are prayers necessarily moral. Man may sacrifice and pray to be freed from reproach of murder, from persecution by evil spirits, but also to be safe in violating for a year his oath, without meeting punishment from Varuna.3 

It is the conviction of the Brahmanas that life on the earth is on the wholea good thing ; for a man to live out his lengthof days is the ideal, and such traces of discontent as appear arc mainly in regard to the doubt that man mustfeel whether he has even a year more to live.4 If he must die, then the sacrifice avails to carry him to the world of heaven, but he is never normally anxious to precipitate this result ; if a rite carries him to the sky,it ends, none the less, in restoring him to the solid earth. Besides death there are other evils ; hunger, dice, women, sleep, cause sin as does untruthfulness ; these are of the nature of things,for Prajapatiis untruth and darkness as well as truth and light ;5 but no question is yet raised as to the compatibility of the existence of the creator and evil.6 Nor is there any effort to evolve a complete code of moral rules ; a man owes sacrifice to the gods, Vedic study to the seers, offspring to the Fathers, a triad of obligations, but also hospitality to friends ;7 the duty of truth, as we have seen, is repeatedly asserted. But of the three duties, which in an Upanisad8 arc enunciated as the three da's, generosity, self-restraint, and sympathy (datta, damyata, </*/// (//*r/////), only the first is heartily recognizedin the Brahmanas. Gifts are a bridge to the heaven, a gift of a cow protectsone's life, that of a garment prolongs it ; the food destroys him who eats what he should give to others the priests par excellence. It is only in an Aranyaka that we have the wise counsel that a man should be able to say' No'as well as'Yes' and to give only at the right moment.9 Self-restraint is asserted in one passage of the gods,10 but sympathy is a virtue of the Upanisad period. 

In the undeveloped state of ethical views it would be hopeless to expect any political philosophy, nor have we any. The existence of the castes is taken for granted, and their origin attributed to divine creation whether in the version of the Purusa hymn of the Rigveda or in some variant form.11 The

duties and privileges of the castes are often mentioned incidentally, occa sionally in more completeness, but there is no effort to develop a theoretic 1 TS. ii; Caland, Overde W< wlv/> /. 1 1 JurJ .. TS. vi. 3. 10. 5 ; fB. i. 7. 2. 1 f. 2 KS. xxii. 1; B. x. 5. 4. 16. BAU. v. 2.

version of the matter. The Brahman is required to be of Brahmanical descent, to follow an appropriate course of life, to possess renown for learning, and to be engaged in the spiritual advancement of the people. In return he is entitled to receive honour and presents, and to be exempt from oppression and the death penalty.1 The Ksatriyas are to protect the people, and show considera tion for Brahmans, while the commonalty in its subjection to these two castes is not very much better off than the udras, children of the Asuras or of non existence, save in so far as they are sharers in the rites of the twice born. It is assumed 2 that, in the perpetuation of the due subordination of the castes, there is assured prosperityfor the people ; no attempt is made to demon strate or render this theory plausible. In the relations of the king and his Purohita there is an element of contract, with which may be compared the effort of the Buddhists to base the existence of caste relations and the state on contractual agreements as well as on creation myths,8 but the Brahmansinsist in the ceremony of the royal consecration that they own no king, for Soma is their overlord, an assertion of the superiority of the priestly to the warrior class doubtless more honoured in theory than in practice, though not without actual importance. 

Of the origin of kingshipitself we have variant versions, while the con dition of anarchy is once vividly described.4 On one theory5 Indra owes his kingship among the gods to Prajapati's favour, who at first made him the most inferior, but later conferred on him his own lustre and made him over lord, of the gods. Another version6 makes him the chosen of the gods, including Prajapati, by reason of his eminent qualities of mind and body. Yet another 7 makes the gods choose Soma as their king, because they felt that they owed their defeats at the hands of the Asuras to their lack of a sovereign. Or again they consecrate Varuna,8 their brother, because they see in him the form (rupa) of their father, Prajapati. Among men the rule of the Rajanya is explained9 on the ground that he is the representative of Prajapati, thus being entitled, though one, to rule over many. It is, however, dubious whether this should be regarded as precisely a doctrine of the divine origin of the kingship in any specific sense ; at any rate there is no effort to expounda doctrine of hereditary divinity in the Brahmanas, and the ceremony of the Hajasuya, or royal consecration, hints at recollections of an elective kingship by the consent of the people.10 The inviolability of the king is asserted,11 andhis duty to assert and defend the law,12 Dharma, but no grounds of a philoso phical character for his obligations are alleged.

5. Modes of Thought and Categories 

Despite their interminable controversies, of which the Brahmanas contain many hints, there is no evidence of the developmentof any logical theory. In a late text, the Taittiriya Arariyaka,1 we find, indeed, an enumeration of four means of attainingcorrect knowledge, tradition (smrti), perception (praty aksa), communication by one who is expert (aitihya), and reasoning (anumdrui). This occurs in a verse to be used in connexion with the piling of the Anuia ketuka fire, a late rite, and it has epic parallels,2 showing that it represents a late popular view. It is obvious that it is unscientific, for tradition andcommunication obviously are not distinct sources, and what really was meantby reasoning does not appear, nor is the term otherwise defined in the Brahmanas. 

The real distinction in the Brahmanas is between what is normally per ceived (pratyaksa) and what is beyond mere perception (paroksa), and, as the gods prefer the latter, so men recognize that mere appearancesare not the 

essence of reality. Hence the foundation is laid for the doctrine of forms (rupa) which lie at the basis of the interminable and seemingly absurd identi fications of the texts. Philosophically the view has a real importance,for it points to the developmentof the pantheistic doctrine which asserts the unity of the individual self and the universe ; the individual is no more than anaspect of the universal. What is obvious is not what is ultimately true ; what is pratyaksa for men is paroJcsafor the gods ; what is paroksafor men, is pratyaksa for the gods.8 Hence, although the importanceof sight as a source of knowledge is asserted, at other times the emphasis is laid on the necessity of thought to penetrate reality, but this stageis not consciously reached until the Upanisad period. In the Brahmanas what we find is the assertion of special insight through the power of asceticism, which enables the seers to behold the rising of the metres to the heaven.4 By asceticism or even without it the seers discover the sacred texts and the rites, for already these are regarded as beyond human creation or invention ; they must be seen, learned, or found, not created. Indra himself in visible form reveals the Stomabhaga formulae to Vasistha, a Saman converses with Ke^in Dalbhya, a voice unseen instructs Devabhaga, a golden bird, a maiden possessed by a Gandharva reveal secret lore. rautarsi Devabhaga discovers the right wayto divide the sacrificial victim, but dies without revealingit to any one ; a supernatural being tells it to Girija. The great texts trace their revelation to such gods as Aditya, Indra, Prajapati, or Brahman, though no purposeful action is ascribed in this regardto these deities.

Chap. 27] Modes of Thought and Categories 483  

Against tradition of this kind human ingenuity is valueless ; Yaj fiavalkya, always an innovator in spirit, asserts that there are two kinds of created things ; the Re verse says three, and its authority is conclusive.1 Neverthe less human thought must have an outlet, and it expressesitself in the deepconsideration of topics, styled Mimansa, the desiderative form of man,6 think ', a term so common that it can be omitted, the genitive case alone standing to denote the object of investigation. At other times Mimaftsa fares less respectfully ; suggestions that a rite should be carried out in other thanthe established manner may be dismissed as mere speculation. Another term, Vicikitsa, also a desiderative formation, denotes the doubt which promptsinquiry, while the final result is denoted by Sthiti, the station attained. 

Unfortunately this consideration does not penetrate to facts, but lives largely in a world of fancy, unrestrained by regard for reality and with extremely slight sense of the limitations of knowledge. If the Taittirlya Samhita 2 in a moment of sanity admits the possibility of doubt whethera man really exists in yonder world or not, that candour is accidental andepisodic. The theologians of the Brahmanas are not prepared to admit to ignorance of any sort, and revelation reduces them to interpretation at their pleasure, aided by the fact of the bizarre nature of the revealed texts. If the waters can practise asceticism, it is not surprising that speech can speakstanding in the seasons, or that the sacrificial consecration can be pursued bythe gods with the aid of the seasons, or that the ascent of the metres to the sky should be visible. The texts operate freely, as alreadyin the later Rigveda, with the conceptionsof being or not-being, but they fail to make anyserious progress in discovering effective categories. The cardinal points andthe year lead very slowly up to more adequate conceptions of space and time, and the two seem endlessly confused even in the Upanisads. The conception of causality remains wholly obscure ; instances of natural causation are recorded, but equally we have the most fantastic conceptionof cause andresult, and it is significant that neither Karya, 'result', nor Karana, 'cause', appears. Other importanttechnical terms are missing ; there arc no expres sions for relation in generalor conditions, the expressions Visaya,'object ', Viparyaya,'opposition ',3 Pravrtti,*activity ', and Nivrtti,'cessation fromaction ', arc wanting. On the other hand, certain advances are made ; the adjective prdkrta in the ^atapatha Brahmana reveals the existence of the conception Prakrti,'ground form ', later famous in the Saihkhya ; difference is expressed by Nanatva, though the later Bheda occurs only in the morerecent Upanisads ; the nature of any thing is expressed by a derivative in tva or id, and in a late passagein the Taittirlya Aranyaka4 the use, later established, of an abstract in the ablative as giving the ground of some result, is actually found. The terminology of the Brahmanas does not know any

general expression for sensation or perception, compelling needless repetitions, which the Upanisadsalso adopt, but phrases such as*In each season there is the form of all the seasons' show efforts at expressing general conceptions.1 

When no clear distinction had been made between personal and impersonal, and anything whatever might be conceived as active and living,it was in evitable that little progress could be made with formal definitions. We haveinstead endless identifications ; the sacrifice is man or the year or anything else which may suit the moment, and, if the horse character (apuatva) of the horse is explained, it is merely that it came into being from the eye of Praj&pati when it was swollen (a^oayat). Some of these etymologies were probably recognized as absurd by their makers, but others not, despite the fact that there was already developing itself an acute system of linguistic investiga tions, which reveals itself in the early appearance of terms for number (vacand), case forms (vibhakii) and so on, and in investigations as to euphonic combina tion and phonetical peculiarities.2 When the priests set to work to define, they normally merely give fanciful identifications, as those of Agni Vai9vanara, which they propoundto A9vapati Kaikeya.3 Nevertheless, occasionally they reveal more acumen ; the vague term Kratu is defined ;* When a man wishes, "May I do that, may I have that," that is Kratu ; when he attains it, that is Daksa.' 4 

When definition is in so feeble a condition, classification naturally fares nobetter. The love of numbers already appears as a dominant factor ; the termPrana is subdivided into five elements, among other divisions, and these five are obviously incapableof presenting any intelligible picture to the minds of the priests ; moreover, under the same title we find not merely varieties of breathing, as is natural, but the quite different set of five, mind, speech, breath, sight and hearing. But other numbers and divisions are also found ; we have here signs of that love of numerical enumerations which is seen in its full development in the Anguttara Nikaya of the Pali Canon or the Ekottara gama of the north, and which on one view has giventhe Samkhya philosophy its distinctive name. 

Reasoning, indeed, we find, but of a peculiarcharacter. Its logical value consists merely in its systematic form, marked by the use of the particles6 vai and khalu vai, the former of which marks the general principle asserted as the basis of the reasoning, the latter the identification which renders the general principle apposite. Thus, if it is necessary to explain why during the consecration the person consecrated has milk as his sole food, the principle6 is asserted,fcBy milk indeed (vai) embryos wax'; the application follows, 4 Now indeed (khalu vai) the consecrated personis as it were an embryo ', and the conclusion is arrived at,'In that he has milk as his food, he causes

himself to wax.' Or againl we have,*By means of the Stoma the gods prosper in this world ; the Vatsaprais a counterpartof the Stoma ; in that he pays homage with the Vatsapra, so does he win prosperityin this world.* Theprinciples and their applicationalike rest on mere assertion, and it is seldom that they are self-evident. Naturally, when deductive processes are so feebly represented, there is no effort at induction, which is found only in the Upani sads, and even then merely in the form of arguments which exhaust a series of possibilities, assumed, not proved, to be exhaustive, and so assumed tacitly, no expression of the assumption being requisite. There is a further advance in the Pali canon, but that is of still later date.2 

With thinking still so undeveloped, it would be impossible to expect anyserious advance in the construction of categories to aid in the comprehension of the world. The distinction between what has and what has not life andpower of action is not made ; the gods, demons, men, plants, beasts of all kinds, are no more alive than the atmosphere, wind, rain, storm, minerals, the sacrifice and its utensils, numbers, metres, qualities or emotions. The holy power and the lordly power are concrete activities, like the strength (wrya) of a man ; his greatness (mahiman) is even said along with his Atman to constitute him.3 The anguish caused to the victim in the slaying adheres to the roasting spit, and if placed on earth will penetrateto the earth ; guilt (enas, dgas) is a substance which the god can carry with him ; a man's gooddeeds are within the altar, his evil deeds without it.4Equally substantial are conceptions such as right, asceticism, evil, death, immortality, truth, false hood, space and time. These two are normally represented by the cardinal points and the year ; gradually we find the development of Akaga, whichdenotes the vacancy between objects,5 such as the Antariksa between heavenand earth, but it is also material, as the Upanisads frankly recognize, and of Kala, which primarily means the suitable moment for any thing, but becomesregarded as a cosmic power,similar to the year,in the Atharvaveda. 

Even the more imposing conceptions of being and not-being prove to have little profundity. Being does not denote in the Brahmanas the whole of existence as a unity, contrasted with the imperfect plurality of the individual ; it is essentially the term to denote that whence the world emerged, and the Vedic thinker proceedsto ask whence it itself came, evolving the answers not being or something beyond both being and not-being,identified in the usual light-hearted manner in one passage with mind.6 Not-being naturally as the foundation of all things is subject to similar identifications ; it may be said to be the seers, or to practise austerities, or to desire to become being, mereverbal intricacies without trace of serious thought.7 

Some effort, however, is made to secure order in conceptions, and there can

be traced the gradual formation of the ideas of the five elements and of the five senses, with mind above or beside them, ideas which introduce some degree of system into the conceptionof the external world and of man's powers, although terminology remains changing and vague. Persistent from the Purusasukta onwards is the effort to distinguish and compare the macrocosmand the microcosm ; what is interpretedas regards the gods (adhidevatam, adhidaivatam) as earth, atmosphere, and sky, is mind, breath, and speech as regards the self (adhydtmam) ; wind, fire, sun, the quarters, and the mooncorrespond to breath, speech, eye, ear, and mind. Similarly there is a markedlove for arranging thingsin lists, each with many correspondences ; if the creator produces* from his mouth the Trivrt Stoma, it has as correlative the god Agni, the metre Gayatri, the Rathantara tune, the Brahman amongmen, the goat among beasts, and similar series are invented for the other Stomas. Correspondencein any sense is a basis for identification, and affords one of the various rounds of connexion even of the loosest nature whichjustified a Brahmanical identification. 

More interestingis the effort to express aspectsof reality by the use of the word Tanu, 'body'.It denotes primarily simply the body of a person or his self regarded as corporeal, as in the reflexive use of the term and in its occa sional exchange with Atman,2 which denotes the spiritual aspectof the self. But it is specially frequentin the plural to denote what may best be styled aspects ;3 thus Agni has one aspectas bearing the oblations to the gods, another as carrying the offerings for the dead ; he has auspicious and dread aspects. The aspects may be mortal or immortal ; Prajapati has five of either, mortal as hair, &c., immortal as mind, &c. Taken together they may make upthe whole, or they may be set beside the self, Atman, as members ; or the whole may itself be styled a Tanu.4 Or the aspects may be in different places ; even the Rigveda recognizes that Agni has such aspects. In any case the Tanus give rise to indefinite possibilities of identification, since in respect of some one or other of them most things can be made similar. 

While Tanu is not of enduring importance in Indian thought, Rupa,' form ', remains a term of high importance. Its primary meaning is visible extension or shape ; it is the object of the eye,as sound is that of the ear. Only during life does form exist, being lost in death, a hint of the doctrine of the necessity of the imposition of form on matter to create the concrete individual.5Similarly6 the Brahman is said to enter the world when it is to be made distinct by means of name and form, the name correspondingto the form, and thus to develop the idea being the means of expressing the nature of the form, though this conceptionis far from that of the Brahmanawhich treats name and form as two distinct active potencies.

venture to attach too much importanceto the aspectof Rupa as form, for even in the Chandogya Upanisadl the term denotes not pure form, but a material possessing form ; heat, water, food are the results of the creator entering the world with name and form. 

Form naturallyserves as the basis of identifications, for almost anything can be said to be the form of another, either on solid or on fanciful grounds. Thus the bull can be said to be the form or symbol of Indra, typeof malestrength, butter and goldof the cow, repaired things of the fire piledafter anfruitless effort. Or the firesticks are the hidden form of Agni, while he is the revealed form. If things have any form in common, they can be identified, andthough Tanu derives its origin from the corporeal aspect of a thing, and Rupacomes from the idea of appearance, they tend largely to coincide in force. But, unlike Tanu, Rupa is regularly associated with name, and the association develops into the expression, name and form, which in Buddhism expresses concrete individuality. 

Akin to Rupa in the view of many scholars is the somewhat vague termDhaman, especiallyin cases where we hear of the Dhamani of such a god as Soma,2or, as often in the Brahmanas and earlier, of the dear Dhaman of a deity, though the sense' abode'is preferred by Hillebrandt8among others. We hear of the butter as the dear Dhaman of Agni,of the mead as that of the Agvins ; speech is that of Indra and Agni,salt that of heaven and also of the cattle, the quarters that of Soma.4 A frequent reward of the man whoworships correctly or has the proper knowledge is to attain the Dhaman of the deity, or by the use of the sacrificial strew, which is the Dhaman of cattle, oneobtains them.5 In Oldenberg's view6 the term denotes what is ordained (dhd). Thus in the Rigveda we hear of the ordinances of Mitra and Varuna, and with a genitive the term often denotes what is appointed by some power.7 In other cases, when thus used, the term in the genitive expresses what is ordained, or the substratum, in which the thing ordained has effect ; the former maybe the meaning in the Rigveda8 of the phrasethe Dhaman of the Rta, whichis givene as the description of the dawn, or the Dhaman of the sacrifice.10 But, while this explanationhas the advantageof being true to the etymology of the term, and is doubtless largely correct, it is clear that the meaning* abodef early developed, and this sense should probably be recognized much morefreely than is admitted by Oldenberg, though he recognizes that the term did develop something approachingthis sense.11

It is significant that contemporaneously we find the science of grammaralone in process of development ; the Brahmanas show knowledge of the scientific grouping of the letters,1 of the distinction of case forms, numbers andso forth, and the elaboration of the system of Panini, as well as the researches of the Praticakhyas prove the skill which was being developed in this period. The Nirukta of Yaska which falls in date at the close of the Brahmana period proves how considerable had been the advances made in regard to questions of etymology, the classification of the parts of speech (of which Yaska reckons four, nouns, verb, prepositions, and particles), and the nature of language.2 The superiority of Indian achievement in this regard to that of contemporaryGreece is manifest, but, on the other hand, there is extremely little evidence of any progress in regard to astronomy or mathematics, for we cannot accept the overestimates of the knowledge involved in the ulba Sutras, apart altogether from the doubt as to their date, and the fact of their serving essentially practical ends.8 Of natural science we know nothing at this period, and both in the Brahmanas and the Upanisads the nature of the ideas current is incompatible with any progressin these matters in contemporary thought.4

CHAPTER 28   

THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE UPANISADS 

1. The Origin ofthe Upanisads 

NATIVE traditionI derives the term Upanisad, by means which will not bear scrutiny, from roots which yield as its sense either that which destroys innate ignorance, or that which leads to the Brahman. It is more importantto note that from an early period the utmost stress is laid on the secret character of the instruction contained in these works : the rule is that they are the highest mysteries, and that their doctrines should not be imparted to any pupil, other than a son, who has not already studied with the teacher for a year and who

does not intend himself to become a teacher. The same view is enforced bythe facts recounted in the texts : when the deepest partof the discussions arrives, the two concerned go apart and talk of the new doctrine of action as the source of human fate. 

When, therefore, we seek for an origin of the term which will not defy the laws of etymology, it is necessaryto find something which will accord with this essential nature of secrecy. The word is derived obviously from the prefixes upa-ni and sad,'sit ', and the only natural meaning is a session, a sitting down near some person, who naturally is assumed to be the teacher. This accords with the mode of teachingfollowed in India, which, as we have seen, involved the sitting of the pupil and the teacher facing each other, while the latter repeated the lesson to be learned by the former. The lessons of the teacher to his pupil were not publicin the ordinary sense of the word : to bepracticable they naturally required quiet, but the ritual texts show us morethan that : they bear witness that certain texts of special importance were to be taught to the pupilin the forest, and not in the normal place, the abodeof the teacher. With this accords admirably the fact that the Upanisadsform parts of, or are attached in the case of the most important and old of these works to, texts which tradition gives the names of Aranyaka.2 Thename must clearly, as held by Oldenberg, have been derived from the fact that the discussions contained in these works were studied in the forest ; the alternative view3 that the Aranyakas were specially intended for study by

the Vanaprasthas, men who, after serving their apprenticeshipas Brahmanstudents and having performed as householders their duties, retire to the forests to study, is clearly a more advanced conception than that obtained in the early Upanisads. The later view is an artificial conception, and one which grew up only with the strict division of stages of life enjoined on Brahmans, if not always observed. Naturally, however, the Aranyakas,in so far as they are texts of allegorical interpretation of the sacrifice, were studied by such Vanaprasthas more than were the Brahmanas proper, which were rather ritual in their interest, and presumedthat the sacrifice was actually being performed. The Aranyakas in their more distinctive portionsdeal with the meaning of the offering, without necessarily assuming that it will be performed: they some times suggest modes of performingthe sacrifice by meditation and repetition as of the Hotr formulae only. But the distinction of Brahmana and Aranyakais not an absolute one : in no case have we in the works handed down to us Brahmanas which always supposethe performanceof ritual, or Aranyakaswhich assume that it is not to be performed. Nor can we see why the dis tinction, which was probablythe real one between the Brahmanas and the Aranyakas, the comparative sanctity of their contents, should have attached itself to precisely the ceremonies to which it did so attach itself. The ritual texts of the different Vedas show us clearly the fact that certain rites and texts were regarded as especially sacred, to be performedoutside the village, andthese texts are contained not merely in Aranyakas but even in the Samhitaform.1 Thus the Pravargya rite is treated in this fashion in the Taittiriya Aranyaka iv and v, while the Mantras concerned are also to be found in the later part of the Vajasaneyi Samhita,2 in which they are followed by other Mantras, containing certain dread names of the Maruts and certain invocations of formidable character used in the horse sacrifice. The Aranyagana of the Samaveda and the Aranyaka Samhita contain the secret texts of that Veda,8 and the Aitareya4 and ankhayana Aranyakas5present the secret texts of the Rigveda, of which the most importantis that concerning the Mahavrata, an old and popular rite, while the former contains also the Mahanamm verses,6

which appear in a form strangeto the manner of the Rigveda and akin to that of the Samaveda, in which they are also found. Both texts contain also certain mystic doctrines regarding the Samhita form of the text of the Rigveda, andthe ankhayana deals also with the Mantha. Both also include, like the Taittiriya, philosophical Upanisads. The Aitareyins and the Kausitakins of the Rigveda placed the Mahavrata ceremony in the rank of a fit subject for an Aranyaka, but the Yajurveda allowed it to appear in the Samhita, and the Samaveda treats of it in the Paficavin9a and Jaiminiya Brahmanas. But wecan realize how from their superior sanctity the tendency grew for these treatises to be used as the places of the record of the secret doctrines, whichgradually, in the mind of the priests, took the place of the more material performance of the ritual. 

As the distinction between Brahmana and Aranyaka is not an absolute one, though the Aranyakas tend to contain more advanced doctrines than the Brahmanas, so the distinction between Upanisad and Aranyakas is also not absolute, tradition actually incorporating the Upanisads in some cases in the Aranyakas. The most that can be said is that the term Upanisad, whenapplied to a text, normally denotes that it contains speculation, mainly on the nature of the universe and of the Atman or the Brahman. Its use in the Upanisad is in one or other of the senses'secret word'or'phrase ','secret text' or 'secret import'. Thus, when the phrase1 neti neti, 'not so, not so', is used as an expressionof the highest unity, that is an Upanisad ; or again the word jaldn 2 as indicating that in which beings breathe, perish, and are born, or the phrase3satyasya satyam,4 the truth of the true ', or tadvanam4as the final end is so described. In the texts of the Taittiriya school in special the phrase is used at the end of a section of philosophical teaching as a descrip tion of that teaching. Or the word is appliedto a special subjectof knowledge, such as the meaning of the word Om. In a slightly different way we hear of a man's Upanisad, which denotes his secret rule of life, such as that one should not beg.5 In these senses the term Aranyaka is never used, and thus we canperhaps see why the two different words Aranyaka and Upanisad came into being. The former is a name, denoting the generic character of the texts, as those which from their secret nature must be dealt with in the special manner of being studied in the forest ; the latter is a secret text, imparted at such a secret session, and in course of time more and more specifically appropriated to the description of secrets which were of philosophical character. Beyond these generalisms we are hardly likely to be able to 

penetrate. 

Two different theories of the origin of the term have, however, been urged (ZII. i. 58-68), who inclines to ovcresti 3 BAU. ii. 1. 20 ; 3. 6.

and require some notice. It is the view of Oldenbergx that the real sense of Upanisad is worshipor reverence, that the word expresses the same ideas as Upasana,2 and that it is due to the constant practice of the text to recom mend the adoration of the Brahman or the Atman under the guise of somesymbol. There can be no doubt about the fact of the use of symbols in this way, but it is certain that the use of upa-sad as a verb in the Upanisads is always quite clearly distinguished from the meaning'worship ', and relates only to the going to a teacher, and sitting beside him for instruction : it is admitted that in this sense the normal use is upa-sad, not upa-ni-sad, but it is also plausible that the choice of the term was dictated by the fact that Upasad has in the ritual a very definite meaning of its own, which rendered the selection of a different word desirable to describe the action intended. In the second place it is clear that the idea of reverence or worship must have passed away at an early date from its original sense, and that, therefore, there is nothing to commend it on the ground of simplicityas an explanation: the Taittirlya Upanisad uses the term of the mere knowledge of the combina tion of letters, and the sense'rule ', as in*not to beg ', cannot be deduced from4worship'as easily as'secret instruction'can be deduced from4 session ', beside a teacher, as opposedto a gatheringfor open discussion, Parisad or Samsad. In the third place, though this is not at all conclusive, the Atmanor the Brahman is not properly the object of reverence at all, since reverence implies the very duality which the Upanisads deny, and, if in reality the origin of the word layin that sense, then it must be admitted that the Upanisads bear a name which their essential doctrine transcends. This of course is quite possiblein itself : the other two considerations set out make it 

improbable. 

The view of the word taken by Dcussen3 differs from that adopted above, which sees in it a natural counterpartto the term Aranyakas, and derives it from the tradition of the Vedic school teaching,in that it assumes a break in the development of the thought of India. For that view it should be observed that there is the advantage of continuity: the Brahmanas shade off imper ceptibly into the Aranyakas, the Aranyakas shade off into the Upanisadswithout violent change of any kind. But on the theory of Deussen we are not to adopt the view that secret import on the subjective, and secret instruction on the objective side, were the meanings developed from the secret teaching in the forest. On the contrary we are to believe thafyatthis pointat a time when the Brahmans were still bent on the study of the ritual, the warrior class developed a new and striking philosophy,4 which they expressedin secret

formulae like tajjaldn,1 called Upanisads, because the essence of their character was secret communications, and that these doctrines were accompanied bysecret explanations, from which in the course of time arose the first Upanisads. We must, it is claimed and has been argued by Garbe2 with great emphasis, accept the view that it was not to the Brahmans, but to the warriors, to the princes, and the nobles, and to the wisdom of kings that India owed its 

philosophy. 

This argument rests on facts recorded in the texts themselves, in whichkings appear as authorities on philosophy. In the Chandogya Upanisad8 five learned Brahmans desire to learn from Uddalaka Aruni the nature of the Atman Vaivanara : he doubts his ability to explain it, and as a result all six betake themselves to the king Avapati Kaikeya, who gives them instruction, after first demonstrating the inaccuracyof their knowledge. In a narrative which is preserved in the Brhadaranyaka Upanisad4 and in the Kausitaki Upanisad 5 a scholar, Gargya Balaki, undertakes to set out the nature of the Brahman to the king Ajataatru of Ka9i : he propounds twelve views or in the Kausitaki sixteen which are all defective, and the king then explains the Atman to him by the principle of deep sleep, prefacinghis instruction bythe observation that it is a reverse of the rule for a Brahman to betake himself to a Ksatriya for instruction. Another legend in the Chandogya6 showsthe Brahmans being instructed in the nature of ether, as the ultimate basis of all things, by the king Pravahana Jaivali. It is added that Atidhanvanonce gave the same knowledge to Udara9andilya, and the former name mightbe that of a prince. Less important is the fact7 that the Brahman Naradais represented in the Chandogya as being the recipient of information fromSanatkumara, later the god of war, who tells the former that all his Vedic lore is a mere name. The great text regarding the doctrine of transmigration8 is set out by Pravahana Jaivali to Aruni with the remark that the Brahmanshave never before had this information, which so far had remained the monopoly of the Ksatriyas. In a third version of this account, given in the Kausitaki Upanisad,9 the king is Citra Gangyayani. 

Nowit is always difficult to believe in the sudden evolution of new doctrines, actually associated in the name with the conception of the absolute of the Brahman class, by circles, whose duty was presumably to wield the weapons of war, and who at any rate failed to retain the control of these doctrines : it is absolutely certain that the Upanisads,as we have them, are not the work of in the Upanisads of the Yajurveda, the

warriors, that they were handed down by priests, and that, if the warrior class originated these doctrines, they failed to continue the interest they hadshown in them.1 Stress must also be laid as against the supporters of the theory on the divergent views taken by them of the real work done by the Ksatriyas. To Garbe they appear to have revolted from the sacrifice, and to have introduced a monist philosophy, centring in the idea of the Brahman presumably appropriated by them, with a curious sense of humour, from their rivals. The doctrine of Karman is expressly claimed as theirs, so that they must be held, while adopting a monist philosophy, to have insisted on the importance of morality. On the other hand, the Brahmans were forced to adopt this Ksatriya view by the pressureof public opinion, which compelled them to adopt it into their own system. This, frankly, appears a very curious conception ; it is remarkable that the public should insist on a philosophic monism, when we remember that throughout Indian history we find every form of worship pursuedwith a painful eagerness and precision, and when weremember also how little popular opinion anywhere insists on a strict monism,especially one which empties life of any reality. A further difficulty arises when we find that the Ksatriyas are credited by Garbe2 with the creation of the Samkhya philosophyas a revolt against prevailing views ; apparently one set of Ksatriyas operated against another, and, as he accepts Ksatriya doctrines as the basis of Buddhism, we find that the great schism in Indian views was that of one Ksatriya view against another. Hertel,3again, who accepts the doctrine of the Ksatriya origin of the philosophyof the Upanisads, ignores the fact that the doctrine of Karman is their chief claim, and insists instead that they were rationalists who depersonalized the old gods, substitutingin lieu the idea of nature powers called by them fante de mieux, through the povertyof language of the time, deities, and whose philosophy was essentially a monismatheistic, materialistic, and morally indifferent. Judged on" this basis it maybe doubted if the praise lavished on the Ksatriyas at the expense of the Brahmans would have exactly been acceptable to them. 

As has been indicated, stress is naturallylaid in support of the theory of Ksatriya influence on the explicit assertion of the king that the knowledgeof transmigration had never belonged to any Brahmans, but the assertion is a very odd one: the king claims that the*givingof instruction'has been the possession of the warriors because the Brahmans have not studied this doctrine, but even for India such a thought is absurd and meaningless, andreduces the claim of the king to what, it seems, is an idle vaunt. Then again, as it is impossible to deny that the Atman-Brahman doctrine has a long pre vious history in the Brahmanas, and is a logical development of the idea of 1 A further complicationis adduced by appear to be explained by their those who believe that Buddhism was supporters.

unity of the Rigveda, we must admit that the warrior class must have shared in the intellectual development, which producedthat idea, and then started a fresh view which nevertheless was based on the Brahman, not the Ksatra in opposition to the sacrifice, while the priests were deeply engagedin the sacrifice. But the sacrifices were essentially not matters in which the priest acted for himself : he aimed at securing the profit of his patron, and the patrons for the greatsacrifices must have been in the main the very warrior class, which we are to assume turned with disgust from the sacrifice.1 The true solution of the problemis suggested by the obvious difficulties of the position of the maintainers of the theory : we must adopta solution which explains why the whole Upanisad tradition is Brahmanical, and yet why the texts record actions of importance as regards the doctrine by the princes of earth. It is absurd to imagine that these references would have been left to stand hadthe Brahmans found them derogatoryto their dignity: the sense of historical accuracy must have been very strong, incredibly so indeed, which would have induced a priesthood to preserve an exact account of the royal founders of each doctrine, and that they did so is sufficiently disproved by the mere fact that they clearly did not preserve a true account even of the Brahman founders of their doctrines. The prominence of Yajnavalkya can hardly be historical, since he is also the greatritual teacher of the atapatha Brahmana, and the device of assuming more than one man of the same name is absurd in this as in many other cases, since the texts assume that the two are the same : nor again does any one really believe that Sanatkumara was a human king. 

The explanation2 becomes simple enough when we look at the Brahmanasand the Rigveda : there we find that kings arc often mentioned as generous donors : that there are lists of the great kings who performed sacrifices, andwho beyond all things gave fees to the priest, just as in historical times great kings, like Pusyamitra and Samudragupta, boast of their offerings. It wasclearly necessary for the priests, who abandoned the doctrine of sacrifice, to live : they, therefore, had to find patrons and they must accordingly,like their predecessors, the sacrificial priests, representtheir teachings as worth large sums. As a king must sacrifice to give gifts, so he must at least understand, and take part in discussions, to give gifts, and the position of the kings mighteasily be wholly deduced from the needs of the priest. But it would be un necessary, and, it may be added, perhaps unjustto hold this view :, ^the thought of the Upanisads with all its demerits is a far nobler thing than the thought of the Brahmanas : as later among the Buddhists, the minds whichcould rise from the mere sacrifice to the consideration of the self were quite capable of accepting help from other minds : of low origin, Satyakama,

whose mother was a mere slave girl Jabala, who ran about with men and whocould not tell his father, was taken as a pupil by Haridrumata and attained the complete knowledge :x even the epic, in one of its juster moments, allows a learned udra honour and permits a merchant to instruct a Brahman.2 In modern India saints of the highest rank have been other than Brahmansin caste. The princes were now and then seers, like Divodasa, son of Vadhryava,3 and they may for their part have now and then wearied of the sacrifice, and sought a higher truth, just as, inversely, we hear of seers who sought kingly rank for their offspring,4 and there may be that degree of accuracy in the figure played by them in the legends.6 But that the philo sophy of the Brahmanas as seen in the Upanisads is essentially the develop ment of the philosophyof the Brahmanas cannot reasonably be doubted. Noris there any ground for thinking that the philosophy had its chief homeanywhere save in the holy ground of the Brahmans, the land of Kuruksetra, which seems to have been in this periodas in the earlier epoch the placeof Brahmanical culture par excellence.6 The culture was not absolutely restricted to that area : the mention of Avapati Kaikeya carries us further to the north west, while we hear of Brahmans who dwelt in Magadha,7 though that wasrare. The Kausitaki Upanisad8preservesfor us in the movements of GargyaBalaki the traces of the extent of the activity of the new movement : he wentamong the Kurus, the Pancalas, the two folks then being joined, the Ka^is and Videhas, and the Vaas and Matsyas, and among the U$maras. All this accords with the extent of the land in which the sacrifice was prevalent, andthe addition of the Kosalas would complete the list : doubtless their omission here is mere chance. Other allusions to countries do not show any substantial extension of the geographical horizon of the authors : the Vindhya mountains are, it seems, known to the Kausitaki Upanisad, and this is perhaps a proof that the Vedic civilization was extending southwards9 in greater degree than in the preceding period. The references to the Indus region, whence came salt and noble horses, suggest that it was afar off, but against this is to be set the mention of Gandhara as not at all a distant country in the ChandogyaUpanisad.10 But culture was not in any event rigidly confined to the middle country : scholars in their wanderings penetratedas far as the Madras, onthe Hyphasis.11 

Inevitably the question arises, how far in this period thought was affected by the growing intermixture of the people with the aborigines or earlier 1 CU. iv. 4. p. 400, n. There is no doubt in the 2 MBh. iii. 216. 13 f. Sutra period of the contempt felt for

inhabitants, Dravidians or others. It has frequently been suggested that the philosophy of the Upanisadsis essentially Dravidian rather than Aryan, andplausible grounds can be adduced in this sense.1 Thus, we may be fairly certain that, as time went on, Dravidian blood came more and more to pre vail over Aryan, though in candour we should admit that the evidence on this head is purely speculativein the absence of any real knowledge of the Aryanphysical type which entered India. In the second place the changes in language may be due to Dravidian influence ;2 here again the evidence is scanty enough, in the absence of independentevidence of the Dravidian languages for the periodof the Brahmanas and Upanisads, and the difficulty of tracing to them any definite influence on the language ; the use of cerebral or domal letters, and forms like the second future (kartasmi) or perfect participle used verbally (Jcrtavari), or the developmentof constructions with the in declinable gerund, may have been encouraged by tendencies among the Dravidians; but this cannot be definitely established. That Rudra-ivais mainly aboriginalis rather a guess based on the belief that the name denotes 'red'than an ascertained fact, and we have no assurance on the strengthof which we could claim that the use of trance and asceticism or caste were Dravidian elements appropriated by the Aryans. The pantheismof the Upanisads may be deemed to be a philosophical development from the animistic views which Jainism and in a sense Buddhism presents, and whichmay be contrasted with the anthropomorphicnature godsof the Aryans, anda contrast may be drawn between Iranian religion and Indian,8suggesting that the former presents us a pictureof the practical Aryan mind as opposed to the more mysticIndian intelligence. These contentions, we may admit, donot lead to any assured results in the sense of establishing the Dravidian4 claim. What they indicate is the unquestionablefact that the Upanisads,as in some degree all earlier thoughtin India, represent the outcome of the reflections of a people whose blood was mixed. We may, if we desire, call the Upanisads the productof Aryo-Dravidian thought ; but, if we do so, we mustremember that the effect of the intermixture must be regarded in the light of chemical fusion, in which both elements are transformed. 

2. The Extant Upanisads 

The texts which have come down to us are certainly not the beginning of the intellectual activity of the time : they bear every trace in their manner andmatter of representing the result of many discussions, and deviations of opinion among the priestlyschools. The doctrines have been handled and1 A. E. Gough in his Philosophy of the happily. See below, Appendix G.

rehandled, and the names to which they are ascribed cannot be taken au piedde la lettre : as in the case of Yajftavalkya, we cannot assume that they really prove or indicate activity in philosophical research on the part of the men whoare mentioned. It is also important to note that the texts, such as they are, are, in the case of the more important at any rate, not the productions of a single hand : they are redactions, perhaps made at more than one time,1 of varying philosophic arguments, and they therefore contain very various doctrines, which arc not often consistent. < 

It is perfectly possible to arrive at a rough estimate of the relative periods of the Upanisads. The first place must probably be accorded to the Aitareya Aranyaka 2 in its philosophic portion, that is the first three sections of the second book, and probably the Aitareya Upanisad, which fills the remaining three sections of the second book, is not to be dated later than any of the other Upanisads : the only evidence of later date alleged by Deussen3 in the case of the Upanisad cannot be taken as sufficient to prove his view. After these works must certainly come the Brhadaranyaka Upanisad in its main

portion, books i-iv, and the Chandogya Upanisad. The Chandogya is in almost every case, as far as one can judge, secondary in its versions of matterwhich it shares with the Brhadaranyaka Upanisad. But at any rate it is certain that the Taittiriya Upanisad, which forms books vii-ix of the Taitti riya Aranyaka, is later than the two last-mentioned : it exhibits the doctrine of five 4 as opposed to three elements,5 and that in a way which renders the simple view that the distinction is unimportant most improbable. This is a matter of real consequence in the progress of thought,6 and the argumentis of quite different weight than that derived by Deussen from the fact that the Aitareya Upanisad7 knows of four classes of living beings to three of the Chandogya :8 the classification is merely mentioned en passant, and is of nomoment in other Upanisads. The Kausitaki is much later than the others, except the Taittirlya, but is probably earlier than it. Its version9 of transmi gration is a new edition of that in the two great Upanisads, the Brhadaranyaka10 and the Chandogya,11 and its account12 of Gargyaisa more developed one than 1 BAU. consists of three parts (i-ii, iii-iv, than BAIT. iv. 3. 38.

that in the Brhadaranyaka,1 while in another section2 it is clearly later than the Aitareya.* Finally the Kena, which is in partmetrical and is in itself a part of much longer Upanisad,the Jaiminiya Upanisad Brahmana, is no doubt to be ranked as the last of the older Upanisads. The Jaiminiya 

Upanisad Brahmana itself is of the nature of an Aranyaka rather than a mereUpanisad : that it does not bear the title Aranyaka is perhaps an idiosyncrasy of the Saman schools, none of which actuallycall any text of theirs anAranyaka. As an Aranyaka it has no claim to any very early date : it seems in fact to be certainlylater than the Aitareya. The Taittiriya Aranyaka,4 on the other hand, apart from the Upanisad section (vii-ix and x),is of mostmiscellaneous content and various date. The Brhadaranyaka Upanisadforms part of the last book of the Qatapatha Brahmana,5 and the title shows the close relation of Aranyaka and Upanisad.In the case of the Chandogya, the first two sections of the work are of the Aranyaka type, but as with texts attached to the Samavcda generally do not bear that name. The Kausitaki, like the Aitareya, is partof a longer Aranyaka.6 

The next groupof Upanisads is marked by the fact that it is composed of texts in metre, with very slight exceptions.It contains the Katha, the l$a, the vetiicvatara, Munclaka and Mahanarayana,7 that is the last book (x) of the Taittiriya Aranyaka. The texts are distinguished from the previous group, not merely by their form, but by their contents. The old discussions with their tentative and confused efforts to reach definite results are replaced by a definite phraseology,in which the results of speculation have been summed up in brief dogmas, expressedoften with an obvious desire for the paradoxical and the bizarre. The allegories, not rarely found in the Upanisads of the older class, which share them with the Aranyakas, disappear altogether. More marked still is the relation of the texts to the other collections : the Katha bears the name of a famous school of the Black Yajurveda whoseSamhita is still preservedfor us, but its nature is that it is really a rewriting, from a philosophicalas opposedto a ritual pointof view, of the story, found in the Taittiriya Brahmana, of Naciketas and the winningof boons from Deathby him. The Mahanarayana is reckoned in some authorities as the tenth book of the Aranyaka of the Taittiriya school, but the Aranyaka is a body of very various and confused contents, and between it and the Upanisad there is no inherent connexion at all, such as always exists in the previous group. Similarly the lea Upanisad has succeeded in obtaining entry as a book (xl) of the Vajasaneyi Samhita, with which it has nothing really to do, and which

has been much added to in the course of time, parts of its contents in booksxxxi, xxxii, and xxxivl belonging in conceptionto the period of the Brah manas. The vetacvatara and the Mundaka have not even a nominaleffective connexion with any extant text, beyondthe fact that the Muncjaka

uses the Atharvaveda (x. 7), and we need not supposethat they ever had anysuch connexion. 

In this group it is quite clear that the Katha takes the first rank : its style is suggested already by the metrical part of the Kena and by verses found in the Brhadaranyaka in a later addition.2 The I^a is clearly dependent on the Katha,3 and the fveta^vatara is certainly* well aware of the Katha, and is probably a good deal later even than the I?a, which is free from the sectarian spirit of the vetavatara in which the philosophyleads up to the glorifica tion of Rudra as the god par excellence. The Mundaka uses apparentlythe 

vetavatara,5 and it again is probably presumed by the Mahanarayana.6 The last group of important Upanisadsconsists of the Prana, the Maitra yamya, and the Man<Jukya. They are in prose, but they differ essentially in every respect from the older prose Upanisads: the diction is in style muchmore elaborate than the early prose, and in the case of the Maitrayanlya, which Max Muller wrongly believed early in date, the language is obviously closely allied to classical Sanskrit, which it follows in the introduction of greater development and complexityof style. The order of the Upanisadsin this group is certain as regards the Pra$na and Maitrayanlya,7 and pro bable as regards the Mandukya.8 In philosophy they show their wide know ledge of the earlier texts, which they freelyuse. The Pragna is proved to belater than the Mundaka by the fact that it presupposesit and quotesit.9 With these the list of important Upanisads closes : but the manufacture of these works went on indefinitely down even to modern times. The later Upanisads claimed connexion with the Atharvaveda, and it is probable that the Mundaka and the Pragna were really so connected : the others had noreal bond of union, but were pleasedto assume one for their own purposes. These Upanisads fall into four classes, according as they (1) merely develop doctrines already found in the older Upanisads ; or (2) devote themselves to 1 For its several partssee Scheftelowitz, despite Burua, Prebnddh. 2nd.

The history of the text of the Upanisads is of interest, but not of impor tance for philosophy: the Atharvan Upanisads seem the first to have beencollected into one set : we know of collectionsx of 84 or 52,2 in which case others from the older type were added. A later collection, which arose in South India, has 108 Upanisads, includingall the great Upanisads of the older type. A collection of 50 Upanisads was made at some unknown date and wastranslated into Persian in 1056 for Dara Shukoh : a literal Latin translation from the Persian made by Aiiquetil du Perron in 1801-2 was the means of bringing the Upanisads to the notice of Schopenhauer,3 and winning for themthat place in the history of philosophy which they have never lost. The collec tion includes in 12 Upanisadsthe older texts, 26 Atharvan Upanisads and8 others, and makes up the total by adding four chapters of the Vajasaneyi Samhita.4 Of the dates of the making of these collections we have no proof : it is, however, possible that by the time of ankara (9th cent. A.D.) the Prana and Muri(Jaka were already studied together. It is certain that hemade use of all the Upanisads included in the three great groups, save the Maitrayanlya and the Mandukya, which he perhaps did not regard as anUpanisad at all. To him also are ascribed, though with doubtful justice in all cases, commentaries on these Upanisads, except the Kausltaki and the Maitrayanlya, and also a commentary on the Mandukya, which however is probably the work of a different aiikara.5 The Upanisads used by Ramanujainclude all those of the great groups, save the MandQkya (though the Karikaof Gaudapada is cited), the Subala and Culika, and once even the Garbha,Jabala, and Maha. The Jabala and Paingi as well as the Karika are mentionedby ankara. 

The question of absolute dates for the Upanisads is one far more difficult than that of the relative order of the texts, and admits of no decisive solution. The one argument of weight is the fact, really undeniable, that the doctrines of the Upanisads are presupposed by the doctrine of the Buddha, and that, accordingly, if we accept the view that the opinionsof the Buddha can begathered with approximate accuracy from the older texts of the Pali Canon,it is probable that the older Upanisads are, substantially at least, older thansay 500 B.C.6 The argument is not by any means perfect : it may be criticized

on the ground that even now the date of the Buddha is only established byvery conjectural means, and still more so by the fact that the date of the Buddhist Canon rests on mere tradition, which is demonstrably in manyrespects defective, so that the frequently repeatedassertion that the Nikayasrepresent approximatelya period shortly after the death of the Buddha is wholly unproved and almost certainly quite untrue. A more serious argumentis afforded by the really antique character of the metre of the metrical Upanisads,1 such as the Katha, Kena, and l9a, but here again no absolute date is arrived at, since the only standard of comparison is either the epic, whichis of very uncertain date and being not in pari materia not an absolutely safe criterion, or Pali texts, which, apart from their own uncertainty of date, are written in a different speech, and, therefore, certainly not cogentlyto be adduced as evidence.2Perhaps more secure is comparisonwith the metre of the Brhaddevata,8 which is with much plausibility assigned to the fourth century B.C., and this certainly suggests that the metre of these texts is older. 

More positive evidence cannot be found : the view that the KathaUpanisad is older than Buddhism, because the legend resembles in somedegree the legendof the Buddhist Mara,4ignores the fact that the storyis already found in the Taittiriya Brahinana. The suggestionof Walleser6 that in the Tevijja Sutta we are to find a reference to the Aitarcya, Chandogya,and Taittiriya Upanisadsis quite impossible,6 and the definite use of anyparticular Upanisad by any Buddhist Sutta has still to be proved. Thesimilarity7 of the language of the early Upanisads to that of Panini is decidedly against a very early dating. Certainlyit is wholly impossible to makeout any case for dating the oldest even of the extant Upanisads beyond the sixth century B.C., and the acceptanceof an earlier date must rest merely on individual fancy. 

In the case of the later Upanisads any dating must be still more vague. Hopkins 8 indeed suggests the fourth century for such works as the Katha,Maitrayaniya, and the veta-9vatara, but this appearsto be as regards the Maitrayamya much too early a date : style and content alike suggest that this is one of the most recent of the important Upanisads.In the case of the fveta^vatara, the date selected by Hopkins appears high in view of the fact

that he is convinced that this Upanisad is later than the orthodox atheistic Samkhya, and than the theistic Samkhya-Yoga, and marks the appearanceof the illusion doctrine foreign to the early Upanisads. But this view of his can hardly be acceptedfor reasons which will later be given, and there is, accordingly, no strong objection to the suggested date beyond the fact that there is no cogent evidence for it. A very different view of the date of the 

veta9vatara, the Mundaka, and the Man(Jukya Upanisadsis suggested byWalleser,1 who holds that the illusion theory is posterior to, and derived from, the nihilistic school of Buddhist thought, and that in particular the Mandukyais not necessarily anterior to the Karika of Gaudapada taken by him as adesignation of a Bengal school, not of an individual which expounds the illusionist form of Vedanta for the first time, and which was in being byA.D. 550, but not necessarily very much earlier. This view, however, is with out any sound foundation, and of these Upanisads no assured date can even be

suggested. 

The investigation of J. Hertel2 as to the age of the Muncjaka Upanisadyields little that is positive.Its comparatively late date is assured, apart fromits imitations of the Katha among others, by the fact that it mentions for the first time, except perhapsfor the Taittiriya Aranyaka,3 the seven worlds byname, that it has a list of Vedic sciences which includes the six Vedangas,though that term is not used,4 and the Atharvaveda by that title, and uses the term Vedanta of the doctrine of the Upanisads. It knows in all probability the personal Brahman.6 In certain points Hertel indicates similarities withJain views ; thus, as the title indicates, the work seems to belong to an Athar vavedin sect which practised the habit of shaving the head or pulling out the hair,6 a Jain practice. The Purusa in the Upanisad is described by comparinghis various members to the fire and other cosmic powers ; the Jains, unlike Buddhists and Brahmans, are wont to represent the universe in human shape in their cosmographical fancies. The Upanisad approves asceticism, as does Jainism, and treats release as attained by one who has gained the Brah maloka, and it is from that world that the man who is freed7 attains his final abode in the Jain system, and a parallel can be drawn between the terms in

which the Upanisad and the Jain texts describe the ascent. Certain of the terms of the Upanisadhave Jain currency (cyu, nirveda, rdga, vltardga, samyag jndna,granthi). It is, however, clear that in all these cases there is no reason to assume Jain priority. Nor do metrical tests do more than show what is other wise certain, the priority of the Katha.1 Grammatical forms8 of pronouncedinaccuracy suggestcareless composition rather than assure any definite date. 

Another possible source of evidence is the date of Isvarakrsna, the author of the Samkhya Karika. It is perfectly clear that the Samkhya system was substantially older than he in its substance and even in detail, so that a considerable age must be assumed for it, if Igvarakrsna is to be assignedto the first century A.D. or even the first half of the second century A.D. Unfortu 

nately the evidence as to Ifvarakrsnais by no means satisfactory. It seems, however, clear that he was either an older contemporary, if he is identified with Vindhyavasa, of Vasubandhu, or still older, but this clearly, accepting the earlier date of Vasubandhu, which terminates his existence about A.D. 350, 

does not lead us further back than about A.D. 300, or half a century earlier.3 A further argument, however, has been adduced by S. K. Belvalkar,4 whoholds that the commentary on the Karika, which was rendered into Chinese byParamartha about A.D. 560, was the work of Mathara, and is to be dated about A.D. 400. Now as the Mathara-Vrtti frequently calls ^varakrsnaBhagavant, a term which would not readily be appliedto a recent author, wemay assume the date of the first century A.D. or shortly after for I^varakrsria. 

Unfortunately the evidence for these conclusions is peculiarly unsatis factory. The work for which the title of Mathara-Vrtti is claimed bears this title on the strengthof a single colophon onlyin a MS. apparentlyof A. D. 1400, which is a very slender piece of evidence. The careful analysis of Belvalkar himself shows that it contains up to 8 per cent, of what he regards as con taminations with Gaudapada, and 20 per cent, of students' additions, includ ing a reference to the Hastamalaka attributed to fafikara, while it gives apparently an extra Karika, which certainly has no real claim to be original. In these circumstances, instead of claiming that we have the Mathara Vrtti established as the source of Paramartha and Gaudapada, the natural conclusion seems to be that this is a compilation derived from the original commentary, now lost, to which the style of Mathara-Vrtti has been given without authority in the lighthearted manner of scribes and owners of MSS.Practically fatal to the theory of Mathara as the author of the original com

ment is the fact that the translator nowhere gives or hints at this name, which is also ignored by Gaucjapada. What we really do know of an early Mathara is that Jain textsl which refer to the Satthitanta add to it the 

Matjhara, which means probablythat Mathara wrote on the Sastitantra, with which agrees precisely the assertion of Gunaratna Suri in his commentaryon the Sacjdarsanasamuccayathat Mathara's Bhasya was Sastitantroddhara rupa. Otherwise, the silence regarding Mathara as a commentator of the Karika is complete. We are, therefore, left without any evidence of the real authorship of the original commentary, which, if riot by l^varakrsna himself, need not go back earlier than A.D. 500. 

Mention should perhaps be made of the argument deduced by Jacobi2 from the Kautillya Arthagastra from which he infers that the Samkhya andYoga systems were in existence as well as the Purva MImaftsa and the materialist system of the Lokayata by the fourth century B.C. Unhappilythe evidence adduced for this is not satisfactory, as the date of the Artha^astra must probably3 be placed some centuries after the date of the minister of Candragupta under whose name it passes. 

From a literary pointof view the Upanisads command interest by their introduction of new forms. The dialogue appearsbeside the simpler dogmatic exposition of the Brahmanas, expanded and developed from the brief dis cussions in this form of ritual problems which the Brahmanas occasionally present. The individual character of the new teaching, which was a mystery, naturally furthered this mode of treatment, and dialoguesare recorded between very strangeinterlocutors as well as between teacher and pupil. Interesting is the fact of competitionsin which the speakers contend against one another, in order to win favour and the prizeoffered by a rich prince. Or two Brahmans are enjoyingthe meal offered by admirers ; one comes to them and wins food by setting a clever riddle. A son returns to his father to report that he has been questioned, and has found himself unable to return a reply ; his father assures him that he has told him all he knows, and goes with him to seek instruction. The wise can be induced by strangecauses to give of their wisdom. The geese sing the praises of Raikva ; he is found under a cart, scratching himself; offers of cows he haughtily refuses, but, whenJanafruti presentshis daughter, he taunts him with not realizing that this wasthe boon with which he should have sought his favour.4 Janaka of Videhais the king who appears as the greatest of patrons, and Yajnavalkya the wisest of Brahmans ; in one contest of wits alone he vanquishesnine opponents ;

the head of the last, akalya, splits openas the result of his failure, while robbers steal his bones.1 Women are not excluded from contests, a maidenseized by a Gandharva or even one of Yajnavalkya'swives shows herself anadept in these questions. The gods appear ; Prajapati instructs the intelli gent pupil Indra and the stupid demon Virocana.2 Animals lend their quota of tuition ; the pupil, who watches his master's kine increase, receives instruction from the bull of the herd, from the fire, from a gander, and from a Madgu bird.3 It would, of course, be rash to trust to the historicity of the dialogues ; they are attached readily to famous names, as in the Katha Naciketas and Yamacarry on a dialoguein the later form of verse. 

There is, of course, much that contrasts strangely with the Platonic dialogue. An element of graverisk enters into such discussions, as we haveseen in the case of the rivals of Yajnavalkya ; to hold a wrong view often involves risk of death in an age when the curse is believed to have powerto work its own end.4 Again of real dialectic there is hardly any ; the inquirer is ignorant and makes wrong guesses, the teacher dogmatically expoundsthe truth, with little or no leading up to it, and with still less reasoning for its support ; eiiriously enough,it is in the discussions between Indra and Praja pati6 that we find more of the expressionof uncertainty leadingto a final illumination than usual. There are, however, especially in the dialogues of Yajnavalkya, signs of planning;the outcome is attained by a process of rejection of inferior views, arranged in something like a series of lower to higher.6 

No serious advance in logicis made over the Brahmanas, though faint traces of induction by simple enumeration may be traced.7 On the other hand, there is a certain gain in literary form ; the description of the unity of the universe produces passagesof much higher feeling than was possible when dealing with the sacrifice,8 and distinct power is shown in the invention of such designationsof the Atman as' Not so, not so,' which excludes all particularization, while the phrase6 That thou art'not unworthily sums upthe mystery of the identityof the self and the universe. In other cases wehave empty mysticismas in the unintelligible jalan9 or tadvanam10 as expressions of the absolute. One distinctive feature of value is the use of similes, often of complexity and interest ; they are treated as conclusive arguments, though often only fanciful analogies, and though as always,if these are pressed, they tend to confuse the precise meaning of the text, and haveafforded cause for doubt both to ancient and to modern interpreters.11 Riddles,

inherited from the sacrificial tradition, are curiously rare, though not unknown, and in the earlier Upanisadsthe employment of verse is restricted, though it occurs here and there in the Brhadaranyaka and the Chandogya. Inter esting as presaging the manner of the Pali texts is the constant repetition of the same idea in slightly different forms ; thus whatever is said of one sense is normally repeated verbatim, with only the essential changes,for another ; the generic terms which would have spared the tedium have not yet been invented or even felt to be necessary and appropriate.1 

3. The Interpretation ofthe Upanisads 

It was attempted by the great philosopher ankara to find in the Upani sads the expressionof a single simple doctrine, carried out consistently through all, and in his commentary on the Vedanta as set out in the BrahmaSutra of Badarayana it is his object to interpret that Sutra and to bring out at the same time the doctrines of the Upanisads,the whole forming a great system of philosophyin which no contradictions should exist.2 The plan adopted by the philosopherfor this purpose was simple: he found in the Upanisads the principle that knowledge was of two kinds, wholly different. On the one hand the higher knowledge recognized the existence of absolutely nothing save the Brahman or the Atman, the one unity, which was at once real, thought, and bliss. The force of these terms must be understood in a special sense : realityis not something outside the Brahman : no predication is possible of the Brahman, for predication involves diversity and in the Brahman there is no diversity. Thought or consciousness, which is not anattribute of, but the essence of the Brahman, does not mean actual activity, the vous i/orycrews of Aristotle on the most probable view of that famousdoctrine :3it is consciousness without any object or subject, and therefore differs so entirely from the very nature of consciousness as not in our view to deserve the name at all. The bliss also is that of being which has no con sciousness of any kind and no feeling, and therefore is merely a metaphorical expression. This single thingis all that the world really is, the one Brahmanwhich is the Atman. All the multiplicity of phenomena is unreal : the saving truth which redeems the individual from the constant stream of births is the recognition of this fact, that he himself is really the one Atman, not related as part to it, but solely and absolutelyit. In the expression' That thou art ',4 which is enunciated in the Upanisads,is set out the fundamental fact of all existence, the indivisible unity.

508 The Philosophy ofthe Veda [Partv   

The apparent multiplicity of the universe and the empirical knowledge of man is not in the view of ankara to be denied for a moment, aiikara wages war both against the idealistic school of Buddhism, which denies that there is any real distinction between dreams and waking reality, and the nihilistic school, which asserts that all is mere void. Existence is not momentary at all : it has a substantiality and is real, but only from the point of view of the lower knowledge.1 The Atman in itself has allied with it a power, Maya, illusion, which limits it : the limitation is not indeed real, for that would hopelesslyviolate the essential doctrine of ankara which denies any dualism whatever ; but from the pointof view of the lower knowledge that illusion exists, and throughthat illusion exists all that there is in the universe as known to us. Thus, there is room for a great god, the Hiranya garbha of the Veda, who occupies the position of a demiourgos, inasmuch as he is the Atman, when it is obscured by illusion, and there is afforded an explanation for the seeming multiplicity of souls, for the unending stream of life, for the world of living creatures and inanimate nature. All indeed is an illusion, but it has within that fundamental fact all the appearanceof reality.2 

It will be seen at once that in this doctrine ^ankarahas a powerful weapon, with which to explain the whole of the system of the Upanisads as the product of a single philosophical impulse. Nevertheless, the attempt is undoubtedly merely a clever tour deforce without final validity, and its ingenuityis as great 

but no greater than its improbability. That this is the case could be easily proved by the examination of the Upanisads in detail, but it is suflicient to state that the Brahma Sutra itself did not take the view adopted by ankara : it is now certain, thanks to the efforts of Thibaut,3 Sukhtankar,4 and Jacobi,5 

among others, that the real view taken by Badarayana was more akin to, though not identical with, that taken by the commentary of Ramanuja,6 whose work dates some two centuries after aiikara. The view of that scholar was that the explanationof the world and of the individual souls as mere productsof illusion, envelopingthe nature of the Brahman, waswholly wrong : on the contrary the two elements, the world and the indivi dual souls, had a definite entity of their own, which was perfectly real, even if they were only parts of, and, therefore, much inferior in order of rank to, the Brahman, who is conceived no longeras mere impersonality but as per sonal being. The views of Ramanuja are in many points difficult to formulate 1 For a modern defence of aiikara, see schrift E.Windisch, pp. 153-7, he traces 

Max Muller, The Silesian Horseherd in fabarasvamin on Mimahsfi Da^ana, (1903) ; a good criticism is given by i. 5, the view that BAU. iii. 9. 20 ; Dahlmann, Die Samkhya-Philosophie,iv. 5. 12, recognize a multiplicity of pp. 236-55 ; cf. also Walleser, Der souls contra fahkara's view (Brahma altere Ved&nta (1910).

with precision : there is vagueness regarding the position of the individual soul, the world and the divinity, which is probably unavoidable, but certainly undeniable. But at any rate the systemof pure idealism of the most abstract kind, which ankara put forward, is confronted with a system which is 

pantheistic, for the individual souls and the world are in some sense partof the deity, but which has also a strong theistic element in the fact that the indi vidual souls, even when they become free from transmigration through the influence of their devotion to the lord and his compassionfor them, are deemedstill to retain a separateexistence and not to be merged in the deity. As in the case of all Indian thinkers, the tendency of Ramanuja is to be hazy regarding the nature of the deity, and the part playedin that nature by consciousness, which, as we have seen, for ankara disappearsinto a meaningless abstraction, but the individual soul seems, contrary to the clear tendency of the Upanisads, and of the epic Samkhya-Yoga,1 to retain in its final form of existence somekind of consciousness which is consistent with its enjoyment of the most

perfect bliss. 

Ramanuja quotesthe Upanisadsas agreeing with his doctrine, but he has not made any such determined and deliberate effort to bring the Upanisads into one definite scheme as has ankara : he relies rather on the Sutra thanon the Upanisads, but still he offers an alternative view which suits admirably many of the Upanisad passages, which he cites. He has, of course, the obvious advantage that the distinction of two kinds of knowledge is one which is artificial, and which has no direct sanction from the Upanisads themselves, so that ankara is forced in effect to postulate a distinction of knowledge, whichis not asserted in his sources. 

Of modern interpreters of the Upanisads, the most important, Deussen,2 as before him Cough3also, has endeavoured to show that the view of ankarais the best key to the secrets of the Upanisads: Deussen insists that in his view, which is that of the Yajnavalkyaof the Brhadaraiiyaka Upanisad, 

ankara formulates the essential doctrine of the distinction between the empirical reality and the thingin itself, which was first made perfectlydistinct by Kant, and which reaches its complementin the Christian and Schopen hauerian doctrine of the primacyof the will over the intellect. Deussen holds that this form of idealism is the main doctrine of the Upanisadsin the sense that it was definitely formulated and laid down, and that other doctrines are really deviations from it, caused by the inability of man to remain on the high level of thought postulatedin the distinction, and by the constant effort to apply empirical categories to the thing in itself. From the tendency to regard 1 This doctrine is definitely pantheistic ; the Dahlmaim, Nirvana and Die Sdmkhya Brahman realizes itself in the individual Philosophic, who contends that this is

510 The Philosophy ofthe Veda [Partv   

the universe, however, as actually real and an absolute thing, there grows upthe view that the Atman is the universe which we know, that is a systemof pantheism. Even Yaj ftavalkya, like Parmenides in Greece,1 could not resist this tendency, and falls into the error when he describes the Atman as the internal ruler, or as supporting the sun and moon, heaven and earth, andthe whole universe, or as expanding into the whole external universe. Butthis standpoint was also liable to difficulties : the identity was difficult to hold fast, and gave way to the simpler empirical conceptionof causality : the Atman producesthe universe, and he enters into it with his self, anidea which of course had abundant parallels in the Brahmanas, whenapplied to personaldeities such as Prajapati. This doctrine is found, he thinks, nowhere in the Brhadaranyaka, but in the Chandogya, the Taittiriya, the Aitareya, and later. The Atman, however, still remains the same in the world as in itself : it does not create other spirits, but enters in as itself. The pantheism thus passesinto cosmogonism, and from this point of view or from the former can be explained the insistence on the identity of the spirit in the heart with the infinitely great outside. The next stage of thought pro duces theism : the relation of the Atman to the soul in man is conceived as nolonger one of identity, but as one of some degreeof contrast and independence : the Atman of the individual is set over against the Atman in its highest aspect, tentatively even in some old passages, then definitely and openly in the Katha Upanisad, and still more markedly with the presentationof the Atmanas the god Rudra in the veta9vatara Upanisad. The road was now openfor the disappearance of the deity, since the individual souls were now indepen dent entities, and could explain the universe if taken in conjunction with the principle of the world other than souls, Prakrti, the primevalnature. The idea of god, therefore, disappearsin the Samkhya faith, and later the Yoga, whichin deference to the demands of the popular movement of the day asked for a god, introduces the divinity ab extra with an obvious inconsequence, whichmakes him of no real importance in the philosophyof the theory. 

This is a brilliant and attractive theory, and it, of course, affords a far morerational ground for the historical comprehensionof the Upanisads than does that of afikara with its contrast of the two kinds of knowledge, and its wholly incredible suggestion2 that the authors of the views found in the Upanisads really were making this distinction between the higher and the lower forms of knowledge, when it is plain to the reader that they are simply doing their best to expresstheir philosophicbeliefs for what they were worth. Nevertheless, the idea that the different stages of view are related in the formgiven by Deussen is one impossibleto accept: the obvious history of the Upanisads,3 if we are not led astray by the belief in the opening up of new

1 What was Parmenides' real view in the2 Cf. Speyer,Indische Theosophie, p. 307. second part of his poem is doubtful ina Edgerton ( JAOS. xxxvi. 197-204 ; Studies the extreme, and Deussen's assertion in honor of Maurice Bloomfield, pp. 117- is far from being certainly correct. 35) very justly emphasizes the con-Chap. 28] The Interpretation ofthe Upanisads 511  

ideas by the warrior class, would suggest that the cosmogonic is the oldest form of the doctrine of thci Brahman or Atman. The Vedic oosmogonism is the natural standpoint : we have there the first principle, the first creation or emanation of that principle, and the entry of that principle into the creation. 

The tendency of the Veda is throughout to treat creation, not as somethingwhich is developed by the mere will of the creator, but as something lyingin his nature ab initio : creation is rather development than the bringing into being of something hitherto not existing in any way. Hence the way is pavedfor the doctrine of identityin the Atman :x the principleis manifested in the whole world, as in the myth Purusa by his sacrifice becomes the whole world, and the further step of identifying the spiritual principlein each man with the spiritual principle which is the print; of the world, is an obvious and easy one. The pantheism of the Brahmanas is thus inseparably connected with their cosmogonism : it would be unwise to seek to establish for the Upanisads anyreal distinction between these ideas. 

The tendency of the Brahmanas is certainly to diminish the personal aspect of the deity, but the influence of the popular religion must be borne in mind, as explaining the nature of the development of the philosophy of the Upani sads. The worship of Rudra was, it is perfectlyclear from the Brahmanasthemselves, a very important thing indeed for the Brahmans and the people alike, and the inevitable tendency of this vivid belief in powerful and real gods, not an abstraction, was to make the character of the universal change. Praja pati had been in some measure a god of the ritual : his name helpedto makehim more than mere priestly fiction, but he could not be expected to havethat vivid nature, which is the characteristic of the form of Rudra. Theeffect of this personal adoration of great gods with the sense of dependence onthem and trust in them, which is a real element in the religion of India,2 shows itself in philosophyin the theism which begins to be clearly marked in the Katha Upanisad and which is expressed in the doctrine of predestination there enunciated, in the form that the saving knowledge is not a matter of learning, but is revealed to the fortunate man by the highest power itself. It is only a step hence to the sectarianism of the vetavatara Upanisad, a work which has often wrongly been deemed of much more modern date than it really is, because of the belief that the spirit of devotion to god was a product of the introduction of Christian influences. The theism of the Upanisads is, then, we may believe, a later stage than their pantheism and cosmogonism, andis due to the influence of the personal element in the religion of the priest andBrahmans alike.

There is, however, undoubtedly another side of the absolute, which mustbe set off against the theistic development which in the time of Ramanujawas used to place on a philosophicbasis the worship of Visnu, as in the Qveta9vatara Upanisadit had been made the base of the worship of Rudra.We know of its existence from two independentsources of the highest value, the Buddhist and the Samkhya systems of philosophy, which reveal to us such despair of and disbeliefin the one Atman and the absolute as to present us with nothing but individual souls in the Samkhya, and even to deny, though in a foolish and superficial way, the existence of souls in the Buddhist faith. It is certainly not easy to see how the pantheism and cosmogonismor the theism of the Upanisadscould have producedthis outlook on the world, and it suggests that there must have been in existence a view of the Atman as absolute which emptiedit of much significance, and made it therefore tempting for those, who desired to rise superior to the mere fictions of the popular religion, to find true reality in something nearer hand, the existence of the individual and of the external universe. The theory which postulated anAtman of no real content was indeed to be found, and that was the theory of Yajnavalkya. It is true that the teachingin questionis not consistently carried out, as Deussen admits, but it is plain that it laysstress on the three propositions that (1 ) the Atman is the knowing self, is the subject of cognition ; (2) that as such it can never be an object of knowledge of any sort ; and (8) that beyond the Atman there is no reality at all, as it is the sole reality. Thesepropositions form the basis of the views of aiikara, and it would be a com plete error to supposethat the position of ankara was really due1 to the effect of the teaching of the nihilist and idealist schools of Buddhism, the Madhya mikas and the VijMnavadins. That ankara was deeplyinfluenced by their doctrines is doubtless true enough, but at the same time it seems beyonddoubt that the doctrine which he maintained was originally the propertyof a school of Aupanisadas, and that, therefore, it was descended from an inter pretation of the Upanisads, whose accuracy is confirmed by the actual texts of the Upanisads in so far as they bear out the meaning of Yajnavalkya's owndoctrine : the distinction of the two forms of knowledge, and the effort to show that other views in the Upanisadscan be reconciled with Yajnavalkya's on this basis, are of course the work of the predecessorsof Qankara. 

The view of Yajiiavalkya cannot, save by paradox, be deemed the earliest view or the dominating view expressedin the Upanisads: it must be taken as one view of considerable importance, which has received expressionin portions of two of the oldest Upanisads,the Brhadaranyaka and the Chand ogya, but most of all in the first. Independent and older are the cosmogonic and pantheistic views which appearin the Aitareya Aranyaka2 and in the * As held by Ganganatha Jha, Khanda- as he held, it is really first in Gauda

Brahmanas, and the dominatinginfluence of the view of Yaj fiavalkya ascribed to it by Deussen cannot be established. Its interest for us is not lessened bythat fact : it is the most characteristically individual of the doctrines of the Upaniads, and in some ways of the greatest philosophicvalue. It is, more over, the chief matter in which an advance on the views of the Brahmanascan be recognized. 

If we "are to seek a more plausible theory of stages of development, wemay assume that the fundamental questionof finding a unity in the world wasattacked from two pointsof view, already foreshadowed in the Brahmanas.On the one hand the conceptionof the Brahman was developed to include the whole of the universe; the holy powerwhich controls things becomesexpanded in idea into that which contains and accounts for all. On the other hand the psychic element is also developed,in partdoubtless through the study of the stages of the spirit in waking and sleep ; the unity here is imagined first as breath, Prana, then it becomes conceived as intellect, PrajM,and finally in the more abstract form of the self, Atman, a term which has the advantage of including the conceptionof breath, and also of intelligence, while transcendingboth. A decisive advance occurs when, in lieu of inade quate efforts to express the nature of the Brahman, we have the pregnant assertion of the identity of the individual Atman with the Brahman regarded as a cosmic Atman. But this assertion leaves us with unsolved difficulties ; on the one hand it leads to suggestions such as those impliedor made byYaj navalkya which indicate the illusory character of the world of appearances, asserting the unityof Atman, broken in life by the duality induced by indi viduality, which is merged temporarilyin deep sleep, finally in death ; on the other we have efforts, as in the Katha, to acceptas real, and deduce fromthe Brahman, the whole of the spiritual and non-spiritual world, efforts whichlead to antinomies regarding the relation of the absolute and individual souls and end in the abolition of the absolute in the Samkhya, and of both absolute and individual in Buddhism. 

4. The Problem and Conditions of Knowledge It is an essential feature of the Upanisads that, though they make, as wehave seen, little or no advance in logical doctrine, they do tentatively raise and deal in some measure with the questionof the source of knowledge of the Brahman or Atman. The view of the Brahmanas, of course, is that knowledgeis to be found in the Vedas, and the authorityof the Vedic texts is not dis cussed. In the Upanisads, however, we find that the questionof the means of knowledge is definitely raised : the three Vedas or the four, which are some times recognized, are not always recognizedas the sources of complete know ledge : vetaketu, despite much Vedic learning, cannot solve the questionof transmigration, Narada admits to Sanatkumara his incompetence to under stand the Atman. The Taittiriya Upanisad*expressly reduces the knowledgeii. 3.

514 The Philosophy ofthe Veda [Partv   

of the Vedas to an inferior position by assigning them to the stage of the mind made Atman, which has to be surmounted before reaching the final truth. But these views were gradually and naturally supplemented by another, which makes the Upanisads an essential part, the secret instruction, of the Veda : hence the term Vedanta which first occurs in the veta?vatara Upanisadl and denotes the Upanisads, as the end of the Vecla in which its deepest secret is disclosed. 

The Brahmanas had recognized, beside study of the Veda, the duty of sacrifice, and the importanceof asceticism, and on both these points the thinkers of the Upanisads were bound to take a clear stand. The sacrifice is least reputed in the Brhadaranyaka Upanisad2 where, with a certain insolence, the worship of anything except the self is derided, and the rela tion of the ordinary worshipperto his gods is compared with that of housedogs. Again Yama is said to have his abode in the sacrifice, and the sacrifice in the fees. The Chandogya3 also seems in partto recognize the demerits of the sacrifice. But it would be an error to think that the general depreciationof the sacrifice is characteristic of the Brahmans ; it is clear that a few en lightened minds had a poor opinionof the whole apparatus, but the normalview of the Upanisadsis quite removed from that of oppositionto sacrifice, which is often believed to mark them out. The sacrifice, however, is expressly relegated to an inferior place: the faithful performanceof offerings takes a man but to the world of the Fathers, whence he will return to earth again in due course,4 and not thus can final liberation be won. On the other handthe actual performanceof the sacrifice is rendered needless by the substitute for the ritual acts of allegorical acts : the three periodsof life supersede the three Soma offerings,5 inhalation and speechthe Agnihotra,6 the organsof the self the four priests, and so on. The tendency, however, to restore the sacri fice to honour steadily grows: the Katha7recognizesit as of value, the 

vet&9vatara8 recommends recourse to it, the Maitrayamya9 asserts that without the study of the Vecla, the observance of caste duties, and the following of the orders of life, through the stage of student householder, forest hermit, and wandering ascetic, the reunion of the individual and the personal self is impossible. Doubtless in this we can recognize the growing 

aversion of the Brahmans to the Buddhist and the Jain tenets. The part of asceticism in the pursuitof knowledge is similar to that of the sacrifice. The Brhadaranyaka10is not inclined towards it, recognizingin it as in sacrifice at most a way to the lower bliss of the world of the Fathers,11

the Chandogya* substitutes the faith of the forest dweller for penance. TheTaittiriya Upanisad,2 on the other hand, places value on Vedic study andasceticism, and even insists on the supreme value of the latter : the Mahana rayana3 sets renunciation, Nyasa, above even asceticism : and from the Kena4 onwards the value of asceticism for the obtaining of the knowledge of the Brahman is absolutely recognized and sometimes insisted upon.In this, as in regard to Vcdic study and sacrifice, the processis one of steady accommoda tion to the popular view, which was at the same time the profitable view to the priests. It is needless, however, to sec in this the fact of the borrowing of the theory of the Atman from an external source : the facts accord perfectly witha reform within the Brahmanical fold : the reformers graduallysink back into the main body, while their doctrine in some degreeat least is adopted by the main body of the priests. 

Nor in the oldest stratum of the Upanisads do we find the necessity of instruction by a teacher laid down: Yajiiavalkya5 on several occasions teaches persons such as his wife, Maitreyi, informally and without initiation, and A<;*vapati6 teaches the Brahmans who come to him freely. The rule of taking a teacher is absolute in the Katha,7 and is approved in the Chandogya,8 where the teacher is regardedas being as essential as the removal of a bandage to a blindfolded man, who wishes to find his way home to Gan dhara. In these texts the vague requirementsalso occur that a man should be endowed with self-restraint, renunciation, tranquillity, patience, and

collectedness. 

But beyond these minor matters, which are none of them recognizedas essential in the oldest Upanisads, a further question arises, how far there can be real knowledge at all of the Atman. The natural desire of the philosopher is to know the Atman : the Upanisadsare in very real sense the search for that knowledge, but the conviction is clearly early felt that there were serious difficulties in assuming the possibility of empiric means giving the desired result. The Rigvcda9already contained the idea that the first principle in some degree disguised itself, and the world of name and form becomes in the Brhadaranyaka 10 the immortal concealed in truth, or reality, and as the reality of reality is seen the self. The only normal sense which can be given to these passages is that suggested by the descriptionof the whole universe in the Chandogya u as a matter of words, a mere name. The reality of the world is empiric, the true reality is the Atman, which the empiric reality conceals. It follows, therefore, that all so-called knowledge is really ignorance, Avidya, and that in death in castingoff the body the soul throws aside ignorance.12

516 The Philosophy of the Veda [Portv   

The Katha x illustrates this theme : ordinary knowledge aims at pleasure, real knowledge at salvation, and it must be accorded through a teacher,2 and by the favour of the Atman,3 a doctrine which develops into the express declaration that the favour of the creator is essential. The Qveta^vatara* carries us to the logical result and offers prayersto the gods for assistance, inculcating devotion, Bhakti, to god and to the teacher. 

On the other hand, there arises in the doctrine of Yajfiavalkya a distinct and different element : the self in this view cannot be known at all.5 There is no consciousness after death, he explainsto Maitreyl, and the grounds of his explanation are that duality is essential for consciousness. The absolute self is unknowable, for there is no duality between it and anything else : the individual self is also unknowable because it must be the activity in knowing, and cannot be the object. The doctrine has echoes in other Upaiii sads,6 and it results in fierce attacks on knowledge, which is ranked as worse than ignorance by the l^a.7 The Katha8laysstress on the necessity of turning the eye inwards in contrast to the mere use of the senses to grasp what is external, and insists that the only assertion that can be made of the self is the mere declaration of existence pure and simple. The way is, therefore, clearly open to the development of the doctrine alluded to in the earlier Upanisads, but not developed until later,9 which seeks by means of processes of physical and psychical disposition to produce the trance condition in whichunity with the absolute, the only possible form of knowledge, is arrived at. 

5. The Nature of the Absolute 

The Upanisads are essentially concerned with the endeavour to describe the nature of the absolute, and the rich abundance of attempts to succeed in this end, proved by the references to conflicting theories in the Upanisads, is clear proof of the busy mental activity of the period. From the earliest Upanisad we have, the view is clear that there is a unity, that it is necessary further to grasp the nature of that unity, and that the proper names of the unity are either the Brahman or the Atman. The two ideas whose history wehave seen in the Brahmanas are used constantly in alternation with each other. It is clear that they must have been felt to be practically akin. Many of these attempts were, it is clear, of little worth : Balaki Gargya in

his interview with Ajatasatru puts forward twelvex or sixteen views of the nature of the absolute. They are 'all of the same type, the soul in the sun, the moon, lightning, ether, fire, water, the person in a mirror, the sound that follows one as he goes, the person in the quarters, the shadow, the personin 

the body, &c., to which the king opposes in reply the conception of that whence the breaths proceed, and on which the worlds, gods, and men depend. Other suggestions made by fakalya2 which treat breath, love, forms, ether, &c., as the basis of the absolute are refuted by Yaj riavalkya, who also rejects the suggestions of speech, the breath, the eye, the ear, mind, and the heart laid before him by Janaka as doctrines enunciated on this head.8 Yaj fiavalkya shows that these things are only the basis of the attributes of the divine unity, and that it is necessary to go behind the mere attributes or their manifestation, which can only be done by recognizing the essential identity of the absolute 

and our own spirit. The Brahmans who with Uddalaka are instructed byA9vapati Kaikeya 4are supporters of the claims of heaven, sun, wind, ether, water, and earth as the absolute unity, there conceived as the Atman Vaicva nara, an idea borrowed from the Agni Vaicvaiiara which forms the subject of discussion in the secret doctrine of the fire in the Qatapatha Brahmana.5 Theking, on his part,insists that the Atman must be within, not an external object. A much longer and more elaborate series of imperfect views is repre sented in the instruction of Narada by Sanatkumara,6 where from name the advance is made through speech, mind, conception or judgement (sariikalpa), thought, intuition (dhyana), knowledge (vijhand), force, food (i.e. earth), water, heat, ether, memory, and longing (apa), to the breath which is the individual soul, and finally to the great one, Bhuman, which comprehends all, fills space, and is identical with the principle of egoism, Ahamkara, and the self, Atman,in man. The transition from the individual to the great one is made thus : truth depends on knowledge, this on thought (mati), this on faith, this onconcentration (nihsthd), this on productive power, this on pleasure, whichexists in the unlimited. 

More important than these theories are others : Indra7 and the demonVirocana went to Prajapatifor instruction : he first describes the Atman as the body, a view thought adequate by Virocana, who is the prototype of all men who merely sec in the body the hope of immortality, and, therefore, deck it out on death with gay raiment. Prajapati then explains the self as the spirit in dreams, but Indra is not satisfied, since the spiritis still in this con dition opposed to a world beyond itself. Prajapati then propounds the self in dreamless sleep, where there is no distinction of subject and object, whichhe explains as not the annihilation of the self, but its entry upon the fullest 1 BAU. ii. 1; KU. iv.

light in identification with the absolute. With this view must be compared a more developed one expressedin the Taittiriya Upanisad,1 where there are distinguished five Atmans ; the first is the annamaya,which correspondsto the body ;then the pranamaya, which correspondsto the life of the breaths or vital airs ; the manamaya, the self of the mind, which here clearly means the activity of the self as conscious will in such actions as sacrifice and study ; the vijndnaniaya, in which for sacrifice is substituted knowledge and worship of the deity in that manner ; and finally the anandaniaya,that of joy before whom words and thought recoil, not finding him. This last self is not an object of knowledge, and hence it is described as not real- empirically ,as 

unconscious and unutterable. In it is bliss, which is broken by the belief in anydifference between the self and it. 

Other efforts are made to realize the Atman by a processof examination of the merits of the different claimants. Thus we have the account of the rivalry of the senses foreshadowed in the Brahmanas carried out in detail. The breath is the victor over speech, the eye, the ear, and mind, because whenall the others go from the body still it is left animated,2 and from another point of view breath alone is able in the conflict of the gods, the senses, and the demons to overthrow the demons.3 Another version4 adds to the other powers the cosmical equivalents, and ranges speech, eye, car and breath against one another, and fire, sun, moon, and wind against one another ;in each case the result is the victoryof breath and wind. In the Kausitaki Upanisad,5 following the Aitareya Hrahmana,6 the cosmic divinities fire, sun, moon,lightning, and the psychic divinities, speech, eye, ear, mind, enter into the wind and the breath respectively. The same idea occurs in an earlier version of the gatapatha Brahmana :7 in sleep speechenters the breath, and so with eye, mind, ear, and correspondingly with fire, sun, moon, and the quartersin their relation to the wind. Hence we frequentlyfind that the breath is set upas an idea of the Brahman,8 but merely to be rejected as inadequate. 

Still more clearly inadequatearc the identifications of Brahman with mind,9 which as in the Brahmanas never achieves a decisive place of im portance, and with more material concepts, such as the sun arid as the ether. The sun is interesting, as it is clear that efforts were made as in Egypt in the reform of Akhenaten to penetrate beyondthe mere physical sun to the man in the sun, with whom the dying man declares his identity.10 The real 1ii.

relation to the sun is, however, declared to be something above that,1 andsimilarly against the conceptionof the absolute as there is set the view that the absolute is in the ether, and is the controller of the ether.2 

Another set of conceptionsis rather different : they are not so much real efforts to explain the absolute as merely to bringit into contact with the sacrifice : it was clearly the most natural thing in the world for the various schools, which were contemporary with the development of the Brahman, to apply to the chief concepts of their special branch of Vedic literature the idea of identification with the absolute. Thus the schools of the Rigveda fixed upon the Uktha,3 the litany, especially that of the Mahavrata ceremony as the absolute, the Samaveda schools chose the Saman and in special the Udgltha,4 and the schools of the Yajurveda the horse5 offered at the sacrifice. Muchmore common is the view that by the mystic syllable, Om, originally no moreperhaps than a formal word of assent, the Brahman is denoted.6 

A more advanced conceptionis to be found in the Aitareya Aranyaka7 which uses the old conceptionof breath, but identifies with it Prajfia,'intel lect'. On intellect the whole world is based, it is guided by intellect, and know ledge is the absolute. The same view is expressed in the Kausltaki Upanisad8 where the identityof breath and intellect is asserted absolutely, but also later on is more precisely investigated : it shows that the objects of sense dependon the organs of sense, and the latter are dependent in turn on intellect, butit still adheres to the identification of the two. The Chandogya itself identifies breath, ether, and bliss. The breath, therefore, still here and there appears with its claim to be the Atman, but it is also now and then made dependent on it, or even the shadow of it. 

But the nature of the Brahman is not intellect alone : it is also bliss andreality, and these ideas are here and there already united as in the later Upanisads, though the enumeration of the triad as the actual character of the Brahman is not actually found in the early Upanisads. In its place the Taittiriya9 once presents the Brahman as being (sat), thought (cit), andeternity, where ananta,'eternity ', stands probably in error for the Ananda,4bliss ', of the later triad. As being the Brahman, it is at once being and not being : the old duplicationof the Rigveda,10 which asserts that at first there was neither being nor not-being is recognized here and there, but in the definite sense that, as not-being, the absolute is not empirical being, and that as being it is also not empirical being,so that the questionis one of terminology

alone and is decided in favour of the appellation being.1 Much more importantis the attribute of thought, which is asserted repeatedly in the doctrine of Yaj navalkya.2 He there asserts that the hearer, the seer, the understander, the knower, are all unknown : they are the soul within, which again is in essence the divine, for all else than it is liable to suffering. In this subject of knowledgeether or space is interwoven : it is the meeting-pi ace of all sounds, smells, sights, and other experiences. The different organs and their functions are only names for the one subject. In his conversation with Janaka,8 the philosopher traces the Atman as the knowing subject, which persists withoutchange through the stages of waking, dreaming, deep sleep, death, trans migration, and final deliverance of the soul. The spirit in the waking state beholds the good and the evil of the world, but it is not moved by it, since as subject it is really incapable of affection : in the state of dreaming it builds up its own world, and in deep dreamless sleep, wrapped round by the intellec tual self, it has no consciousness of objects, and yet is not unconscious. Theself is compared to a lump of salt which has no inner or outer aspects: it is simply a single unit, and so consciousness has no inner and outer side, and is one unity alone. The Brahman is also the light of lights, and through it alone is there any light in the universe. For the wise man there is perpetual andabiding light, and this idea in the later Upanisads appears in a variety of metaphors such as the day of Brahman which is eternal. 

The conceptionof the self as essentially consciousness is not, however, confined to Yaj navalkya : the same view is expressed,in words which may bedependent on the Brhadaranyaka, in the Chandogya,4 and the Aitareya5 and the Kausltaki6 texts as we have seen emphasize the same conception under the view that the self is intellect. In neither case, however, need weassume dependence on Yaj navalkya, for unlike the case of the Chandogyathe line of argument differs, and is, in the later case directly, and in the former indirectly, linked with the conceptionof the self as breath, which does not appear in the development of the ideas of Yaj iiavalkya. 

The nature of the absolute as bliss is also asserted by Yaj navalkya,7 whobrings the conceptioninto the closest relation with his idea of its nature. Thebliss which he contemplates is that of the man in dreamless sleep, when the consciousness of individualityis lost, and when the self, therefore, is above

all pain and grief and enjoys pure bliss, whence it is a simple step to the equation of the absolute and bliss. Nor is there much doubt that here again the Chandogya 1depends on the Brhadaranyaka,2 when it enunciates the doctrine of the absolute as ether, breath, and joy under the mystic name of Kha. The Kausitaki8 also seems to borrow from the Brhadaranyaka, and the whole idea is further developed in the Taittiriya,4 in the Anandavalli. There 

special strfess is laid on the error of seeking to find any division of subject andobject in bliss : that would create division and would admit the idea of fear, which can arise only from division. The dependence on the Brhadaranyakaof this doctrine is borne out by the relation of the dnandamaya self to the vijufinamtiya : in the former text they are the same idea, and, therefore, the conscious self is the highest, there being no difference of subject and objectin it : the Taittiriya refines by making the vijndnamaya still have the distinction of subject and object, and then erecting the dnandamaya above it in rank. It is characteristic of the growth of these distinctions that, later on,5 the dnan damaya itself became regarded as a mere sheath (kofa) in which the self or the Brahman resided. 

The other side of this exaltation of the bliss of the absolute is of course the view that all the world is misery,6 but the pessimism of the Upanisads is moderate : we hear of the miseries of old age and death or disease, and trouble which the knowledge of the absolute removes, but the growth of the spirit of pessimism is only to be traced in Upanisads of the quite late class. 

But, despite the givingto the absolute of these three attributes or charac teristics, Yajnavalkya returns constantly to the fact that they are not to betaken in the empirical sense, and that, therefore, our knowledge of the absolute is non-existent. (The most drastic expressionfor this view is the formula 7 neti neti,'not scvfiot so ', which denies to the absolute any andevery attempt to define it in terms of ordinary knowledge) Its existence is a transcendental reality, which is essentially from the empirical point of viewa nonentity ; its consciousness involves the essential fusion of subject andobject, and the transcendence of their diversity, although the phraseology of the Upanisads always treats the Atman as subject,8 and, therefore, is not ordinary consciousness at all, and the bliss arises from this state of non-dis tinction. Hence we have two different conceptions which are repeated times without number : on the one hand every empiricalattribute is attributed to the absolute and also denied of it : in the second place the most contradictory

522 The Philosophy ofthe Veda [PartV   

observations are made regardingit. The ideas thus enunciated are clear : ^heabsolute is not in space1 which is expressed by the assertion that it is infinitely large and infinitely small, that space is interwoven in it, and that it is all pervading. The absolute is not in time :2 hence it appearsas above the three times, independentof the past and the future, at its feet time rolls on its course : on the one hand it is of infinite duration, but at the same time it is of the instantaneous character of the flash of the lightning, or the"swift rush of thought. The absolute is also free from causal connexion :3 it is said to be absolutely without diversity, and this pointis variously developed: the Katha 4is emphaticthat the absolute is independentof becoming and not becoming, of good and evil, of past and future, the knowing seer is not born, does not die, abides from everlasting. The I<?a5 insists that it is unmoving, yet swifter than mind ; far, yet near ; within, yet without the universe ; above knowledge and ignorance ; that it differs essentially from coming into being and not coming into being. The final answer to the questionof the nature of the Atman is that recorded for us in a legend by aiikara :[ Vaskali asked Bahva as to the nature of the Brahman : the latter remained silent, and on being pressedfor an answer replied,'I teach you, indeed, but youunderstand not : silence is the Atman.'6 

6, The Absolute and the Universe 

The theory of Yajnavalkya asserts, as we have seen, that the absolute is unknowable and not definable by any empirical predicates. It, therefore, becomes obviously a pressing questionto connect the empirical and the real universes : the gulf between the two is only accentuated by asserting, in so determined a manner, that there is a deep division between the one and the many. The relation of the universe as known to the one is, however, the pro blem which all philosophiesfind insoluble in greater or less degree, and the efforts of the Upaiiisadsto bridge the difference are not at all satisfactory. The answer given in fact is merely that the absolute is the same as the world, or that the world is the productof the Brahman. The difficulty, however, arises, in consideringthese passagesof the Upaiiisads, which present the doctrines of cosmogonism and pantheismin close and inextricable union, to know whether we have here efforts to explain the Brahman understood in the

Chap. 28] The Absolute and the Universe 523  

sense of Yajiiavalkya, or merely the natural continuation of the doctrines of the Brahmanas. It is on this point that it is necessary to part com pany with Deussen, who in his aim at system assumes that the doctrine of the absolute, as expounded in the Brhadaranyaka, underlies the wholethought of the Upaiiisads. We can only say that the deeper view of Yajfia valkya may, though not very probably, have been held now and then bythose who express the more crude views of the identity of the absolute andthe universe. 

In the Aitareya Aranyaka, an early text, we find a simple and clear assertion of the presenceof the self, Atman, in living things, but in different degrees, without here, as yet, any implicationof the absolute character of the self or its identity with the universe. He who knows more and moreclearly the self attains fuller being ; the self is revealed in an ascending order or revelation in plants and trees, animals, and man. In plants and trees sap only is found, in animals consciousness is present, but man excels since he is highly endowed with intelligence, saying what he has known, seeing what hehas known, knowing to-morrow, the world and its opposite ; by the mortal he desires the immortal, being thus endowed. As for the others, hunger andthirst comprise the powerof knowledge of animals ; they say not and see not what they have known. Man also is likened to the sea, for the insatiable nature of his desires ; whatever he attains he desires to go beyond it ; if hegains the sky, yet is he not content.1 

The pantheistic view is undoubtedly presentin the many passages in whichthe development of the world from the absolute is expressed in metaphors : thus in the metaphor of the spider from which the thread proceeds, or the fire whence come forth the sparks.2 Often too the Atman is declared to pervade the whole of the universe, it is likened to the lump of salt whichin water disappears, indeed, but leaves all pervaded by it,3 a view which mustbe older than the more refined conception, which, as we have seen, is applied to the Atman when the objectof comparison is a lump of salt, which has noinner or outer aspect, but is but one in itself. The Katha Upanisad4comparesthe self to the light which penetrates everywhere, and adaptsitself to every form. This view is found also in another form, in the laying down of the viewof the self as the inward controller, as the greatest of powers,in which the heaven and the earth alike are contained. This view sets the self over against the world, and in doing so it adoptsthe old view that the seat of the self is the

heart,1 in which accordingly the lord of the universe resides, infinitely small, yet greater than the earth, the atmosphere, and the heaven. He is the pro tector of the universe, the guardian of mankind, the bond which holds the worlds together and prevents them coming into conflict., It is in this connexion that the terms 2 tat tvam asi,'that thou art ', and etad vai tat?'that is this ', must be understood : they assert the essential identity of the self and the universe, but they do not necessarily or originally depend on the adoption of the view of Yajnavalkya, though they may later be regarded as a natural adaptation of it to meet the questionof the relation of the universe and the final reality. 

The impossibility of ascribing these views of the absolute and the world to attempts to solve the problem suggested by the transcendental view of the absolute is seen in the many cases where the realism is material and gross: thus the old doctrine of the creator, the primeval substance created by him, and his entry into it, which appearsin the Aitareya Upanisad,4 cannot betreated as a later development of a primitiveidentification of the universe andthe absolute : it derives directly from the Brahmanas, and shows the early, not the later, date of the Upanisad, as compared with the doctrine of Yajna valkya. The same primitiveideas must be seen in the view that the Purusadwells in the body as a span in height, as flame without smoke. 

From this cosmogonisrn or pantheism it is not a difficult step to arrive at atheism : the attitude of the Brahmanas, as we have seen, is not theistic, for they tend undoubtedly to depart from the primitive conception of Prajapati as a creator god in favour of the idea of the more impersonal Brahman or the 

Atman. But the tendency to abstraction was always, doubtless, confronted with the realism and clinging to personality of the average intellect, and that realism results in the growing tendency5 to separate the individual andthe supreme self, which is a perfectly natural development from the hasty unity of pantheisms. The Katha Upanisad6undoubtedly shows this tendencyin its distinction of the supreme and the individual self as light and shadow, and in the doctrine of the graceof the creator which gives man saving know ledge : the idea is, however, far more effectively brought out in the veta 

vatara,7 where the identity of the supreme and the individual souls is not indeed denied, but can only be realized by the favour of the supreme lord, the lvara, who thus appearsas in some measure distinct from the individual soul. The lvara is also a maker of magic, and the universe is the product, the illusion. The Upanisad shows no trace of the presupposition of the doctrine of Yajfiavalkya : it is adequately explained as the mere develop ment of primitive pantheism,or cosmogonism. 

In this Upanisad it is of importancethat the conceptionof theism is allied * CU.iii. 14. 2; 13. 7 ; viii. 1. 3 ; BAIL Hi.*i. 11, 12 ; cf. CU. vi. 8. 3 ; TU. ii. ; 7. 3. For a possible reference to the Maitr. ii. 6.

to the name of Rudra : the Vedic gods in the Upanisadsexist as much as men,1 but they are nothing more important than men, and need the knowledge of the Brahman as much as men ; Indra and Prajapati himself are, though the keepers of the door of heaven, unable to turn back the man who knows the Brahman. The Vedic gods are in themselves not enough to account for the prominence of the theistic aspect: it is essentially connected with iva or later with'Visnu, new great gods of the popular side of Brahmanism. Thenew relation is seen in the use of the term t^vara, I^a, or synonyms, of the god, and in the use of these terms later of the supreme god in Indian philosophy: these are names obviously in harmony with the chief name of Rudra as the l9ana, the lord, among the gods and the world in general. 

The nature of the process by which the universe comes into being is con sidered under many different aspects, but they all rest on the old hypothesis of the mode of creation of the universe. They adopt just the same sort of language : there was according to one version first not-being, which was being : it arose : an egg was evolved : it lay for a year : it split open into two halves, one of silver which is the earth, and one of gold which is the heaven. Thematerial of the world as it exists is in the most primitive view the waters, anidea already found in the Rigveda2 and this conception is adhered to in the Aitareya TJpanisad. A more developed, and probably later, view is that of the Chandogya TJpanisad,3 which makes the Brahman resolve to create the world, and therefore to create4heat, whence arose, as sweat arises in man, the waters, and from the waters came food, after which the supreme self enters into the three as the individual self, the Jivatman. Thereafter a further step is taken : the Jivatman having entered, the three elements are mixed together so that existing things are composed of the three separate elements, an idea which is the source of the distinction of the subtle and the gross elements, which occurs as such first in the Pra^na Upanisad,5 where the earth, water, heat, wind, and ether elements are distinguished from the earth, water, heat, wind, and ether. A further and very important development of this theory is that of the Taittiriya Upanisad6 which derives from the Atman the ether, wind, fire, water, and earth. This five-fold division may be regarded as the established order in the philosophyof India, and the fact that the Aitareya7 1 There are gods by meritorious action later view, Die Entwicklung der Gottes-

has not it in definite form shows that it is earlier than the Taittiriya. With the five elements correspond the five senses. 

The absolute, after the production of the elements, must enter into the world, and many texts refer to this entry. Hence the world is penetrated throughout organic nature by the self of the absolute, which exists in the plant world, in insect life, in animal life, and in man, in things born of the egg, 

born alive, and sprout-born1 or born from sweat, a category including insects.2 The tree and the plant alike are regarded as animated by a spirit. The idea is seen frequentlyin the doctrine of transmigration where animals, insects, vegetables and gods appear as subject to transmigration. The BrhadaranyakaUpanisad3has, in a legend which may be compared with the famous observa tions of Plato in the Symposion* a theory of the Atman as neither male nor female which is cleft asunder and attains fresh unity in the creation of newlife, human and animal alike. 

It was inevitable that, in the view of the universe which regarded it as a creation, and distinguished between the soul of man and his body, there should arise the conceptionof the soul of the universe related to it as the soul in man to his body : this conceptionis made material in the person of Hiranyagarbha, who in the Rigveda6 is the golden germ which enters into creation after the first action of the creator, or of Brahman as masculine. Theposition of either of these deities is first quite distinctly asserted in the Kausitaki Upanisad,6 and the idea appears in prominence only in the theistic 

vetavatara Upanisad,7 where a third name occurs, the red seer, Kapilarsi, a term often,8 but certainly wrongly, assumed to refer to the founder who is a very legendary figure and may owe his name to this passageof the Samkhya system. But the idea is found in a less theoretic form in the 

Katha Upanisad,9 where in the development of principles the'great self' stands after the undeveloped and the primeval spirit, and later in the Buddhiof the Samkhya. 

The absolute is not merely the creator of the universe : through it the universe after creation continues to live and move and have its being: in its bliss the universe tastes of bliss itself. Ytij navalkya expresses this thoughtin his conversation with Gargi, in which10 he points out that at the bidding of the imperishable one heaven and earth, the minutes, hours, days andnights, half-months, and months, the seasons, and the years are kept asunder, and the streams run from the mountains cast and west, men praise the generous givers, the gods favour the sacrificer, and the Fathers desire the offerings to the dead.

absolute and the Avattha tree, which sends its shoots downwards. He is the dike which holds apartthe worlds to keep them asunder,1 but the samemetaphor, by another turn, is made to yield the idea that he is the bridge which secures continuity between the past and the future.2 From another point of view 3 the absolute is the ruler, the Antaryamin of the universe, whois the controlling powerin the earth, water, fire, atmosphere, wind, sky, sun, the heavenly regions, moon and stars, ether, darkness, and light, of all living creatures, and of the eight organs, the whole complex forming his body, being distinct from him and not knowing him, but yet being ruled by him. In this way again we come to the idea of the world soul, but the difference betweenthis and the view of the veta?vatara Upanisadis that the internal ruler is still merely the absolute. 

But an importantconclusion follows inevitably from the view that the inner power in all is the absolute : he causes the man whom he will lead onhigh from these worlds to do good works, and he causes the man whom he will lead downwards to do evil works.4 The gods are also determined by him : the grass cannot be burned by Agni, nor swept away by Vayu, apart from the will of the Brahman. This idea is found repeatedlyin the Upanisads, and is contrasted with the position of the spirit, which leaves the world after having known the soul and the true desires, and whose part then in all worlds is the life of freedom : he who departs without knowing the soul has in all worlds a life of constraint. The recognitionof the freedom of the self is due to the recognition of the fact that the self is the real actor, and that, therefore, the constraint, to which it seems to be subject,is the constraint which it itself exercises on itself : as the Maitrayaniya Upanisad5 has it,c He fetters him self by himself, as a bird by its nest.' 

An interesting development of the doctrine occurs in the Jaiminiya Upanisad Brahmana;6 the pictureis drawn of a deity, described probablyas 4 the good deity ', and therefore indicating Agni-Rudra, who bars the passage to the sun or beyond to the soul, on the score of the evil he has done, declaring that only the doer of good deeds may pass. The soul replies,' Thou didst see whatever I used to do ; thou wouldst not have made me do it (i.e. had it been evil) ; thou thyselfart the doer/ The answer satisfies the deity, who, there fore, lets him pass. The dangerous implicationsof the doctrine arc obvious and undeniable. 

If the will is thus empirically completely subjectto determination, it is inevitable that, with the growing tendency to view the relation of the soul to the absolute from the pointof view of theism, there should arise the position

528 The Philosophy ofthe Veda [Partv   

that the absolute assumes the appearance of a personal providence. This is clearly the case in the vetavatara Upanisad,1 where the Atman is the over seer of actions, who apportions his qualities to each person, who executes justice, who restrains the evil, allots good fortune, and brings to maturity the actions of the soul. The Katha Upanisad2faintly adumbrates the sameidea in the view that the wise self-existent one has assigned ends for all time, an idea which an interpolator has made more precise by addihg, to the destruction of the metre, the word yathdtathyatas, accordingto the quality of the works of the individual souls. 

In detail we learn very little indeed of the creation of the earth and the world : the old Vedic ideas coexist, according to which there are three worlds, earth, air, and heaven, but the primeval waters are regarded in the Aitareya Upanisad 3 as lying above and below these regions. They are also said to beinterwoven in the ether, by which space may be meant, as the latter is in the Brahman. From the practice of equating the regions with the worlds of the sacrifice, Bhufc, Bhuvah, andSvar, a fourth region is added as Mahas, in the Taittirlya Upanisad4denoting the Brahman : the Muncjaka& adds three more, Janas, Tapas, and Satya are given as their names in the Mahanarayana :6still later, seven lower worlds are invented to correspond with them. A different conception is, however, found in the Brhadaranyaka Upanisad,7 where on the basis of the old cosmic egg there is devised the view that the inhabited world is surrounded by the earth, and this again by the ocean, the world being 32 days' journey of the chariot of the sun in breadth, the earth 64, andthe sea 128. Where the heaven and the earth as the two layers of the eggof the universe meet, there is the space of a razor edge or the wing of a fly, by which access is attained to the placeof the offerers of the horse sacrifice, no doubt the back of heaven. A divergent view8 is found shortly after, in which there are ten layers over the universe, the worlds of the wind, the atmosphere, the Gandharvas, the sun, moon, stars, the gods, Indra, Prajapati, and Brahman. The only importance of these questions attaches to the case of the sun and the moon, which become associated with the doctrine of trans migration : the sun, indeed, is actually apparently deemed nearer9 the earth than the moon.

In the later systems of India it is an essential principle that, in accordance with the doctrine of transmigration, there can never be an origin of the worldin time, and, since, on the other hand, the origination of the world was anaccepted doctrine, the difficulty was overcome by the theory of the periodic destruction and regeneration of the world. This doctrine, which has beenwrongly seen in the Atharvaveda, is certainly not to be found in any older Upanisad, and must be regarded as a definite sign of late date. It is found in the veta-9vatara Upanisad* when the god, who puts forth many times onenet after another in space,is compared to a spider.It is also made clear that it is the actions of the soul which result in the activity of the creator in appor tioning to each person all their attributes. The later Upanisads2recognize frankly the destruction of the universe by periodicfire. The only idea in the older texts 3 which affords the slightest analogy is the mere mention of the fact that into the Brahman the individual must fall on death, an idea whichhas no logical connexion with the developed theory. The latter may havearisen as a mere desire to apply to all the worlds what appliedto the individual : more probably perhaps it is due to the needs of the doctrine of transmigration. 

7. Maya and PraJcrti Illusion and Nature (a) ILLUSION 

In the doctrine of Yaj ftavalkya we have seen the tendency of the Upani sads to assert over again, and in still more emphatic terms, the unity of the world, which the poetsof the Rigveda already foreshadowed, and to deducefrom it the conclusion that the world is nothing that is real in the full sense of the word, since everything in it is not ultimately to be regarded as havinga truth of its own. In what sense, then, can the empiric world be said to exist ? This Yajnavalkya leaves vague, but in his exposition to Maitreyi of the doctrine that after death there is no consciousness he uses terms to whichlater at least great weight was attached. A duality is necessary, he argued, for one to see another, smell another, hear another, and so forth, and in death no such duality is present ; the phrase,4 however, which he uses in this contention is'where there is a duality as it were (iva) ', and it may be deduced, not unfairly, from the addition of the qualification that he was not prepared to admit as absolutely certain the existence of the duality. Later in the Upani sad 6 we have similar wording,' when there seems to be another ', the same

particle being used. Here again we cannot simply ignore the qualification ; to do so is as one-sided as to ascribe to it the value of a definite assertion of the unreality or illusory character of the universe. What we have is the germ of the illusion theory. 

A further passage which has been adduced in this connexion is the declara tion of the Chandogya UpanisadJ regarding the modifications of the three fundamental constituents of being, fire, water, food ; just as all that is madeof clay, copper, or iron, is only a modification, a verbal expression (vdcdram bhana), a mere name, the reality being clay, copper,or iron, so all things canbe reduced to the three primary forms of reality. Further, all reality,it is clearly indicated, is reducible to reality only, all things being mere modifica tions, &c. In Deussen's view2 we have here the first open assertion of the unreality of the universe, a doctrine which shortly afterwards was to berealized by Parmenides in the famous declaration :

and later by Spinoza in his doctrine of modes of the one substance, God. Thealternative view 3 is to regard the whole as frankly realistic ; the name is not a mere name in the sense of disguising a reality ; on the contrary it serves to mark out a reality, just as the phrase nama-rupa can be used to designate a concrete individual made up of intellectual and other faculties and matter. In this case we have a doctrine frankly pantheistic, but not of illusion. Thedifficulty of decidingis increased by the uncertainty of the correct rendering of the text, which Deussen interprets as directly asserting that'changeis a mere matter of words, a simple name ', treating the words vdcdrambhanamvikdro ndmadlieyam as a distinct sentence, instead as is possible of taking it as a predicate description, 'a matter of words, a change, a simple name',and it would be unwise to draw any far-reaching conclusion from the passage. 

We find also in the Brhadaranyaka Upanisad4 in a verse which occurs with slight variation in the Katha,5 a distinct assertion that there is nodiversity and that a failure to realize this fact is the source of repeated death. The l5a emphatically demands that the universe be merged in God, and, moreover, denies becoming and passing away, thus condemning the doctrine of the reality of change ; this at least is Deussen's interpretation,6 thoughit is open to argue that the real sense is merely that the absolute stands abovebecoming and passing away, which it transcends. In the late Maitrayaniya Upanisad 7 we find the comparison of the absolute with the spark which, made

to revolve, creates apparently a fiery circle, an idea which is taken up andexpanded by Gaucjapada in the Mandukya Karika, and which undoubtedly is consistent with the conception of the illusory nature of empirical reality. In other cases adduced by Deussenl there is no need to suspect any idea of the world as unreal, the frequent assertion,2 that with the knowledge of the self all is known, docs not exclude the reality of what is derived from the self ; the reality of the absolute may be contrasted3 with empirical reality, which is styled real by man, without making the latter an illusion ; when the Aitareya4 asserts that the universe is founded in consciousness and guided byit, it assumes its reality, not its merely apparent existence, and, if the elements of being rest on the consciousness and it on the Praiia,5 we need not suspect any lack of reality in them. 

Far more importance attaches to a late Upanisad.6 The precise character of the nature of the external world is summed up finally in the doctrine of the vctavatara Upanisad,7 which sees in the world other than the absolute which it conceives in a thcistic way an illusion, Maya, a term thus first introduced into the philosophyof the Upanisads, to become, through the adoption of this theoryof the universe by Gaudapada and ankara, the basis of the orthodox Vedanta system. It would, however, it is clear, be a mistake to regardthe new term as being a mere individual innovation of the Qveta^vatara school without previous preparationin the literary tradition. The idea of the concealment of the divine nature by illusion is seen in the s.Atharvaveda,8 where it is said that the flower of the water, who is Hiranya garbha, the personal Brahman, in whom are fixed gods and men as spokes in a nave, is concealed by illusion, and the illusions of Indra in his many shapes arc mentioned in the Rigveda.9 It may, therefore, be assumed that the term had obtained considerable favour in philosophic circles,10 before it appears in the Upanisad as a definite doctrine of importance.Still more important is the fact that the term was by no means ill adapted to express the nature of the relation of the empirical world to the real absolute, as it was conceived byYajrlavalkya. It is, of course, impossibleto say that the actual term and its precise connotation would have approved themselves to that sage, or to those who evolved the doctrines which passed current under his name : on the other hand, the doctrine is a legitimate and natural development from the principles which he enunciated. They are clearly not to be derived in any reasonable way from a system, which was pantheistic or cosmogonic, and in which, therefore, the assumption that the world was illusory would have been ridiculous. A pantheism and still more a cosmogonismare under the danger of falling to the level of materialism, but not of evoking an illusionism.

532 The Philosophy of the Veda [Party A very different suggestionas to the development of ideas is put forward bySchayer.1 On this theory the Mya doctrine comes in as the expressionof a conception wholly alien to the normal Brahmanical idea of the regular   

working of the world, in which nature and the ritual stand in constant paral lelism. The Brahman signifies the regular and orderly procedure of the universe ; Maya, on the other hand, introduces the conception of the unregu lated, self-determined, intervention of a god ; Indra\ Maya in the Rigveda2 is the expression of his might, revealed in his great deeds. When, naturally, opposition came into being directed against the Brahmanical conception of the tJbermensch whose knowledge makes him ruler of the universe, we find the idea of the necessity of divine intervention as in the Katha Upanisad,3 and the condemnation by the I^a4 of knowledge as even more unsatisfactory than ignorance, and finally in the Qveta^vatara5 the natural stepis taken of ascribing to god the epithet mdyavin. The suggestion is ingenious but uncon vincing. The vetavatara certainly does not mean that god is a real creator and that matter is his real creation ; the sense of delusion or illusion6 is para mount. 

(b) NATURE 

While, however, one side of the teaching of the Upanisads develops in this brilliant manner, and in the hands of Gaudapada and ankara emerges as the chefd'oeuvre of the Indian philosophical intellect, another and important scheme of philosophy was growing up, and was destined to exhibit itself, at a period not far distant from the close of the great Upanisads, in a living andeffective form. The existence of this system as the definite Samkhya of the classical period is not attested until comparatively late : the oldest text-book, the Samkhya Karika, may be assignedto about the fourth century A.D.,7 and for the earlier form of the system we are reduced to conjectures built on that text, the history of the parallel system of Yoga, and the indications of the epic, which knows well the Samkhya and Yoga systems, but which in regard to its date is so uncertain, that it does not necessarily afford us anyinformation older than that contained in, and to be inferred from, the

Samkhya Karika itself. Very briefly put,1 the classical Samkhya systemdiscards entirely the idea of an absolute : it reduces the universe to a multi tude of individual subjects, which have nothing true about them save their subjectivity, a subjectivity which has no creative power and is not properly realized at all by having an objective content. On the contrary, it is only byerror in any way connected with the existing world, through its fancied con nexion with Prakrti,*nature'. Through the development of Prakrti there arises the principlecalled the great one or intellect, Mahan or Buddhi : the Prakrti is, therefore, to be regarded as purely unconscious, a conception vaguely analogous to the Aristotelian Hyle, and connected, directly as it would seem, with the older views of the Rigveda and the Brahmanas as to the primitive condition of the universe as a chaos. The development of con sciousness must therefore, it would appear, be cosmic, and the Mahan or Buddhi would thus correspondto the Hiranyagarbha of the later Upanisadsand the Vcdanta, the spirit which, in the earlier view, appeared on the waters after the creation of the waters by Prajapatior the Brahman. But at the same time the Buddhi is the first clement of the subtle body, the Lifiga, which is the essence of the individual spirit, and which passes through trans migration. The Buddhi serves as the basis for the development of the prin ciple of individualism, Ahamkara, from which are derived on the one hand the mind and the ten organs or rather potentialities or faculties of sense, five of perception, and five of action, and on the other hand the subtle elements, from which in their turn come the gross elements, though an epic variant gives in lieu the elements and the objects of sense, sound, &c.2 The Linga, which is perhaps most appropriatelycalled the6psychic apparatus ', contains in itself all the elements down to the subtle elements, and even of the gross elements it has the fine parts,3 and it is through it that the individual subject experiences 

or rather seems to experience the facts of this world. The experience is painful and unhappy, even though alleviated by the joys of earth, and the real aim of life is to be rid of the connexion with nature. But that connexion 

does not really exist : it is only thought to exist by an error and, when this error of ignorance is removed, then the connexion is seen not to exist and ceases to exist, the subject being freed from any connexion with an object, and on the other hand, the Prakrti is freed from any pain or trouble, since being absolutely unconscious in the absence of subject there is no possibility of its suffering or enjoying anything. Strictly speaking, therefore, the spiritis never troubled 1 In the main I agree with Deusscn (Gesch.8 Deusscn, Gcsch. dcr Phil. I. iii. 497. This

534 The Philosophy ofthe Veda [PartV   

or suffers anythingor enjoys anything: it merely illumines nature, whichaccordingly suffers, but is set free by the cessation of illumination. But the difference of the result in the two cases is enormous : the subject by ceasing to have an object is emancipated for all time, the Prakrti in that one case is delivered, but that is a matter of indifference since the infinite number of other souls means that Prakrti is ever being unrolled for the gaze of the subject and ever is suffering. 

The whole theory is one mass of difficult paradoxes, despiteits seeming elegance and simplicity of structure. The main basis of the conception, that there is suffering through the connexion of the soul with nature, is contra dicted by the fact that there is really no connexion : the sufferingis pro duced by a connexion which does not exist, and is only imagined to exist, but an imagined connexion is no ground for results which a real connexion alone could produce. The relation of the one Prakrti with the psychical apparatuses which are not conscious except under the illumination of the subject is never clearly explained,or perhapsunderstood.1 At best we may endeavour to conceive the position that the connexion which, however, as we haveseen, is not really existent of the spirit with Prakrti, as a single undifferen tiatcd unit, producesa primal consciousness (Buddhi), which develops underthe influence of the individuation ( Ahamkara) of the spirit an individual formor psychic apparatus, on which is based the life of the individual. In that case the conception of a cosmic development of individuation and the other things would be in the main a mistaken complement of the system which is not essential to it. But there is the grave objection to this theory that already in the Samkhya Karika the paternal and maternal portions of the gross elements are supposed by the author to fall back into and be picked up out of Prakrti by the psychic apparatusin the case of death and rebirth, and not as wouldbe logical and proper,if the development of Prakrti were individual fromthe point of Buddhi onwards, recalled into and evolved from the subtle elements, while the Prabhutas, which represent the material world, are madeto stand over against the selves as an independentreal world. 

It is, however, unnecessary to consider further the contradictions of the Samkhya, and it is only requisite to note that in the nature of Prakrti there is supposed to be contained a triad of constituent factors, Gunas, literally fc threads'rather than'determinant qualities ', which in the passive condition of Prakrti are in a quiescentstate of equilibrium, but which in the process of evolution develop differentlyin the several psychic apparatuses, producing, therefore, the very varied characters of men and of life. These factors are Sattva, the light, the intellectual principle, Rajas, the active and emotional principle, and Tamas, the dark and gloomy principle. The terms are wholly indefinite and unphilosophical, and the use made of them in practiceis mainly

psychical, whereas, as constituents of Prakrti, they ought to have received some different cosmic sense, such as that of conditional being, energy, andinertia, suggested by Hopkins.1 Their importance in the system, however, cannot be underestimated, and it is significant that, while Qankara rejects definitely the validity of these principles, they are accepted by the later school of Vedanta and interwoven with the Vedanta philosophy.2 

(c) THE ORIGIN OF THE SAMKHYA AND BUDDHISM 

The question inevitably arises in what manner these views are to be con nected with those of the Upanisads,3 and the further problem must be men tioned of the origin of Buddhism, which has been traced to the Samkhya. TheBuddhist system differs in one essential from the Samkhya : it abolishes, as does that system, the principle of an absolute, with which the individual souls are identified, and it goes further than that system in seeking to deny the existence of soul. The latter aberration need not, however, be taken veryseriously : the Buddhists, being determined believers in transmigration, hadto produce an entity4 which would transmigrate ; the entity provided does not differ, in any very essential way, from the ordinary view in India of a transmigrating soul, and certainlyis philosophically inferior to the ordinary conception, unsatisfactory as that in itself is. 

No Upanisad attains the pointof view of the Samkhya system, and it is therefore only possible to indicate the mode in which the conception of the absolute tended to fade away and to leave the individual spirits confronted 

with nature. The essential feature of the Samkhya is the evolutionary series, and the name Samkhya,' examination ','calculation ', or*description byenumeration of constituents ',5 rather than a mere counting, suggests that the philosophy owed its importance to its insistence on the principle of careful examination of the elements of the processof development from the absolute. Now in the Upanisads the first case in which the order of evolution from the absolute is stated with precision even then incomplete is in the KathaUpanisad,6 where we find that in the carrying out of meditation, Yoga, in order to reach the absolute, the objects arc merged in the senses, the senses in the mind, the mind in the intellect, Buddhi, the intellect in the great self,

which is also then merged in the undiscriminated, Avyakta, described as the calm self, and that againin the spirit, Purusa, which is the absolute. The similitude of these views to the series of development of the Samkhya is obvious : the separationof the Mahan Atma, the great self, and Buddhi is a distinction which it is difficult to appreciatein the Katha and would naturally disappear on further reflection, with the abandonment of a cosmic Atinan, while the interpositionof the undiscriminated, which correspondsto the position of the old primitive material or waters of the Brahmanas, between the spirit and the intellect, corresponds also precisely to the position of Prakrti in 

the Samkhya system, exceptfor the fact that the Katha is still monistic, andstill regards the spirit as an absolute, whence nature is derived, the individual spirit being identified more or less clearly with the highest spirit. But it musthave been an obvious, if no less a very important, step when it was decided by some thinker that there was no necessity to imaginethe unity of all the spirits in one. Ex liypothesi the spirits were all identical with the one spirit, and, therefore, each must have the same creative powerto producethe undiscriminated as the supreme spirit. To what end then to feign a supremespirit ? Moreover, from another pointof view the postulating of a supremespirit would appear unsound : the enormous varietyof individual experience of life, the plain facts of evcry-day existence, show that there is not onespirit merely but many.1 The theory of unityof all spiritsis difficult and con fusing, and the obvious refuge from these difficulties is to admit that each spirit is a separate entity. The relation of the spirits and Prakrti would follow at once, when this was accepted: the doctrine of Yajnavalkya was clear that the self was merely the knowing subject: clearly, therefore, as the self wasthe subject only, Prakrti cannot be produced from the spirit in any material sense : it is the independent object merely of spirit.2 

It is importantto note the real similarity between the self in the view of the Yajiiavalkya of the Brhadaranyaka Upanisad and that of the Samkhya; both are absolutely without qualityor activity, completely inactive, the capacity of knowing without content ; both, we may fairly say, represent bare abstractions which could never as such be real. If the self of Yaj fiavalkya is wholly apart from empiricalexistence and knowledge, the same thing really applies to the spirit of the Samkhya, for it is not really in contact with matter. In the Buddhism of the Sarvastivadins3 we find the same view of Vijnana, which remains wholly apart from real connexion with the object, being,like it, merely a momentary flashing wholly transitory and uncaused. Naturally in all three cases some effort must be made to explain the connexion of this

subjectivity and the object which makes its potentiality concrete knowledge, and equally naturally at this pointin all three systems we have a lacuna, which is filled up by unintelligible assertions, the Buddhists resorting to a relation of Sarupya,'co-ordination'or'co-relation ', which is found also 

in the Yogabhasyal of Vyasa as the mode of bridging over the gulf betweenknower and knowledge. 

If we seek to find in the older Upanisadsa more direct connexion with the doctrines of the Samkhya than the conception of the self in Yajnavalkya, then the most obvious parallel, in addition to the scheme of evolution in the Katha, is the passage in the Kausitaki Upanisad2 in which a list of ten senses 

is opposed to a corresponding number of objects, and the presenceof intellect, Praj fia, is said to be essential for every kind of sense-knowledge, including the activity of mind in respectof thought and desire. We have here the prototype of the curious feature in the Samkhya of the senses and mind as alike only potential until reflected in some manner in Purusa. The more common idea of the senses being powerless without mind lies doubtless at the back of this more advanced conception, a fact which illustrates the remarkable dependenceof the Samkhya on older ideas. 

A certain degree of parallelism to the Katha evolution series is presentin doctrine of the mode in which on death according to the Chandogya Upanisadspeech (the eye, the ear, and the other organs are presumably here typified by speech) enters the mind, the mind the breath, the breath the brilliance of fire (the other two elements of the Chandogya, water and earth, may beincluded), and that the supreme deity. In deep sleep, again, we have a series in the Pracna Upanisad3 where we may understand that the five gross, the five subtle, elements, the organsof sense, all enter the mind, it the intellect, it individuation,1 it thought, it brilliance, it breath, and it the self, but this latter passage is too vague to be of much importance save as showing how prevalent were these efforts to find the order of evolution. 

In the Mundaka Upanisad5 we find an expression of the order of develop ment commencing from the absolute, as all-knowing, the second element being food, an expression perhaps for the undiscriminated, the coming breath, whichmay correspond with Hiranyagarbha, mind, truth, the worlds, and actions. The more precise similarity of the doctrine of the Mundaka6 to that of the Katha is maintained by Hertcl,7 who has endeavoured to reconstruct anoriginal text of this Upanisad by conjecture from that which, as he holds, based on a single manuscript which was far from correct, has been preserved

to us by ankara. Reconstructions of this kind seldom permitof any satis factory result to others than their author, and there is always the fundamental difficulty, apart from minor points, whether the incoherence of thought which gives rise to the reconstruction is not, as most probablyin the case of the Bhagavadgita, due to the author, and not the result of interpolation. If, however, we omit the whole of ii. 2, and iii. 1. 4-10 and 2. 3 and 9, we obtain the doctrine that, as in the Skambha hymn of the Atharvaveda,1 which affords part of the material of the Upanisad, the highest thingin the world is regarded as personal, from which there emanates the Brahman and whatever else exists. On this view the ultimate fate of the soul on its return is not absorp tion in the Brahman but union with Purusa, the world of Brahman serving merely as the placeof those who fully performthe sacrificial ritual in the modeapproved by the Mundaka. The other portions, however, of the text, which cannot with any assurance be ascribed to working over, definitely identify the highest principle with the Brahman, adoptingthe regularidentification of the Brahman and the Atman, and treating the final result to be aimed at as the recognition of the identity of the Brahman and the Atman. Moreover, even in the verses which are spared by Hertel, we find hints contradictinghis theory of a simple doctrine ; thus in i. 1. 7 all is stated to arise from the imperishable (aksara), while in ii. 1. 2 we find the personal highest being declared to be above the imperishable, and in ii. 1. 10 the Brahman andPurusa are directly identified, unless we hold with Hertel that there is a lacuna in the text for which we have no other ground.It is significant also that the interpolator has to be credited with iii. 2. 3, which adoptsthe Katha2 doctrine of salvation by the favour of the lord, so that we have to assume that, on the one hand, he altered the personal aspectof the Upanisad by insisting on the primacy of the impersonal Brahman, while, on the other, he deliberately addedone of the most personal touches in the shape of the doctrine of grace. This is plainly incredible, and we may safely assume that, while the author workedon an older idea of a personal priusas in the Atharvaveda, and acceptedthe doctrine of grace from the Katha, he himself adoptedthe Brahman standpoint.8 The resemblance of the Maitrayanlya Upanisad4 to the Saihkhya is of a

different character from that of the Katha ; it is due in all likelihood to direct Samkhya influence at a much later date. In this Upanisad we find an answerattempted to the question why and how the absolute self enters the world andappears in individual form. Prajapati, existing alone, had no joy ; therefore he created offspringas inanimate, and to enjoy them he enters with the breaths into them, thus animating them, and then by means of the organsof sense andaction and 'the mind he has joy of them. But the absolute self, Prajapati, remains wholly unaffected, though an apparent actor ; action actually belongs to the Bhutatman, or elemental soul, which overcome by the fruits of action passes to a good or evil birth, and is merged in existence, while the true self remains unaffected like the drop of water on a lotus leaf. The elemental soul is overcome by the qualities or factors of nature, Prakrti, and thus conceives the erroneous impressionof individuality ; thinking* This is I' and' That is mine 'he binds himself as a bird with a snare.1 But the pure self is not without responsibility for this evil state, for a definite though obscure statement attributes it to the fact that the elemental self is overpowered by the inner Purusa.2 The composite character of the text reveals itself in the further con ception of the self as the enjoyer, while the elemental soul is made out to be the body, which it enjoys.3 We find also the three factors named and described at length, essentially as psychic, and Prajapati as affected by Sattva, goodness, as a factor is equated with Visnu, as affected by Rajas, activity, with Brahman,and as affected with Tamas, dullness, with Rudra. It is characteristic that the Upanisad shows equally knowledge of the development of Yoga doctrine, though its scheme of stages of exercises has six in lieu of the classical eight.4 Further, it is markedly pessimistic, the evils of empirical existence being set out with an elaboration of comparison and detail such as is only to be paralleled in the Buddhist texts, which it doubtless knew in some early form. It shows anadvanced psychology,for it recognizes the function of individuation, thoughnot as in the Samkhya in its classical form, as placed between intellect andmind and as the source of the latter, but as following on mind and intellect, without any assertion of derivation, and it conceives of the existence of the subtle body, or Linga, though it is not clear whether it actually asserts that the Linga possesses not merely the fine elements but also the gross elements as part of its composition.5 Moreover, the question is actually posed whetherit is merely the factors that are really subject to bondage, or the self; the classical Samkhya asserts definitely, though not always consistently, that the self is not really bound, but this is not the view accepted by the Upanisad, which insists on the bondage of the self, exhibited in the actions of intellect, mind, and individuation, and promises release when the sense organs, mind, and intellect have ceased to function.6

540 The Philosophy ofthe Veda [Part V  

For the doctrine of the Gunas or factors there is obvious a parallel in the fveta^vatara Upanisad,1 which has on the ground of its content often beenneedlessly supposedto postdate the Samkhya system, a view which cannot be supported on any cogent ground.2 In it, we are told, that one she-goat, red, white, and black in hue, produces many young like herself : one he-goat leaps on her in love, the other abandons her, after associating with her* Theidea of the relation of nature to the many spirits seems obviously expressed in this metaphor. But it is clear that the red, white, and black colours carry us beyond doubt to the Chandogya Upanisad,8 where everything in the universe is declared to be connected with the three elements, the red of fire, the white of water, and the black of food, probably an allusion to earth, this being the order of creation when the absolute first produced heat, thence water, then earth, in the shape of food. It is not necessary to suppose that in the 

vetavatara there is anything more meant than the three elements : the transformation of these to psychic forces, which is prominent in the Samkhya,though the other conceptionis impliedin the ascription of the three to Prakrti, would then be a later development, which in the Upanisads occurs first in the Maitrayaniya.4 

It is clear, therefore, that the seeds of the Samkhya lie in the philosophy of the Upanisads : the conception of the deliverance from the round of rebirth and misery is wholly absurd on the Samkhya theory of the universe, which denies any real connexion of spirit and nature,5 and, therefore, makesany suffering impossible,since without connexion there is no illumination, and without illumination of nature by spirit no suffering of any kind. In the doctrine of Maya there is an illusion which is perfectlyreal though an illusion, and knowledge can dispelit and its products. But the ignorance which mustbe dispelled in the Samkhya is the belief in a connexion which does not exist, and the Samkhya philosophy never suggests that the misery of the universe is due to the belief : it is only possible because of the connexion : ignorance does not produce the connexion : therefore logically there is no misery. Themere fact of this illogicality alone and the marked pessimism of the systemwould testify to its derivative character. 

A somewhat divergent view of the development of the Samkhya is suggested by Dahlmann, who in several works6 has insisted on the view that

Hopkins (.TAGS. xxii. 380-7) insists that6 This leads Spcycr (Indische Theottophie, p. samkhyayogadhigamyam in vi. 13 must

the epic reveals to us the oldest stage of the Samkhya philosophy and not as maintained by Hopkins,1 and in some degreea Deussen among others, aneclectic philosophical view. Dahlmann's positionis obscured by its connexionwith his ingenious but unsuccessful effort to provethat the epicis in itself aunity consciously produced at a periodbefore Pariini, a thesis which rests onabsolutely no cogent or even plausible evidence.3 Nor have we any tolerable ground for "the view that the system of Samkhya as first evolved under that name was other than atheistic, in the sense not merelyof denying an I$vara which in a degree Dahlmann would admit, but also of denying an absolute. Further, it is most natural to hold that the Samkhya-Yoga of the epicis a definite theistic modification of the Samkhya, which is more really theistic and absolutist than the later Yoga, in which as a system attention is directed towards the Yoga practices and not so largely to the theistic aspect.* Butthe rejection of Dahlmann's theories in these respects does not deprive of value his theory of the development of Indian philosophy. He argues that the first stage must be looked for in a view which is in close touch with the expres sions of the Brahmanas as to the process of creation, in which there is more or less consciously assumed to be some material beyond the actual creator, and hepoints out that in the early speculations of the Upanisads we learn of the Atman on the one hand, but also of what is not the Atman, which is full of misery. In more philosophic form this appearsas the doctrine of the Brahman,beside which stands Prakrti, into which is emptied the whole of the ordinary world of thought and action, while the Brahman remains outside all contact with thought, affording the end, Nirvana, which is to be attained by the extinguishing of all kinds of feeling, by the negationof everything empirical. From this dualistic basis he deduces on the one hand the Samkhya and onthe other the Vedanta of the illusionist school. The former view is arrived at by a determined effort to make logical the process of development in final release : it became intolerable to contemplate that there was really only oneAtman, which, by connexion in some unexplained way with Prakrti, producedthe innumerable separate spirits through the action of Buddhi and of Ahaih kara, since release became meaningless, and it, therefore, assumed that there were innumerable Atmans, whose derivation from the primitive Atman wasproved by the fact that they retained the characteristics of omnipresenceand infinity, which belong properly only to the one Atman and which, applied to all, lead to absurdity. On the other hand, the Vedantins laid such stress on the unity of the universe that they denied the existence as real of Prakrti, contenting themselves with the idle doctrine of illusion, which was clearly inconsistent with their own principle of unity. Moreover, he argues, materialism was a natural product of the early view, since it really emptied

the Atman of all empirical reality, and gavesuch reality to Prakrti, and thus encouraged the view that matter by itself was able to produce the universe, while on the other hand by its subjectivismin the doctrine of the Atmanencouragement was givento scepticism, and finally to the philosophicin difference of early Buddhism. 

Apart from the fact that there is really no good groundfor calling the first stage Samkhya,1 and that the denial of illusionism cannot be acceptedas absolutely true of the Upanisads, Dahlmann's theoryhas the merit of directing attention to a real aspectof the philosophy of the Upanisads and the epic : there is a real affinity between the process by which Buddhi and Ahamkaraare deemed to producethe world of experience and the older myths of Praja pati and his desire, Kama, as playingtheir partsin the creation of the world, while still further back we have the picture of Purusa as at once the material and the spiritual source of the world. But it would be a mistake to accept the view that the aspectinsisted upon by Dahlmann was really cither the sole aspect or the chief aspectof philosophyin the periodof the later Upanisads. In particular Dahlman goes clearly too far in stressing the independent character of the evolution of Prakrti, and in his insistence on the nature of lvara as the world soul arising from Prakrti alone, thus placing Prakrti beside the Atman as in itself accountingfor the whole of the empirical world. It must never be forgotten, as Dahlmami himself elsewhere2recognizes, that the spiritual side of existence is essentially conditioned by the fact that in Prakrti the Atman is presentas the observer, a fact which in the Samkhya is preserved and emphasized in the insistence on the doctrine that but for the connexion of Purusa and Prakrti there would be no cognitionor feeling of any kind. When due weight is accorded to this fact, we reach fairly closely to a concep tion which is not far different from that of Badarayana as the normal, not unique, doctrine of the Upanisads : there is an absolute on which matter is dependent indeed, but not illusory, and individual souls which in the Upani sads, but not in the Brahma Sutra, at the end are resolved into the absolute, but which are not in themselves illusory, being, we may assume, the necessary result of the coexistence of the absolute and matter, and therefore endowed, until united with the absolute through knowledge, with a certain relative butreal independence.3 

The real questionis in a sense whether we can legitimatelycall Samkhyaa system which accepts an absolute, and differs from the normal Upanisaddoctrine essentially in the attention givento derivation from the absolute of Prakrti and individuals. The best defence of this suggestionis that of Olden berg,4 who faces the fundamental difficulty that a systemwith an absolute in 

1 Oldcnbcrg (Die Kultur der GegenwarP,8 Cf. also Dcussen, Gesch. der Phil. I. iii. I. v. 34) does not deny the possibility of 259 ff. 

this view ; cf. Buddha6, p. 68, n. 1.4 Oldcnberg, Die Lehre der Upanishaden, 2 Die Samkhya-Philosophie, pp. 80 ff., where pp. 206-58, who accepts an epic he tends to exaggerate,as usual, the Samkhya with an absolute as cxplain Prakrti side of the compound Jiva. ing Buddhism (GN. 1917, pp. 218 If.).

Chap, 28] The Origin ofthe Samkhya 543  

the epic is not normally Samkhya, and that the twenty-five principles of the Samkhya of the epic seem in their correspondence with the classical school to negate the presence among them of the absolute. Oldenberg's suggestion, 

that the twenty-fifth principle includes both the absolute and its manifesta tions as individual, is ingenious, but hardly convincing, and as a matter of terminology and historic fact it sccrns unwise to employ the term Samkhya as applicable tp any system which acknowledges an absolute. The facts of the derivation of the Samkhya above accepted are, of course, not affected by the question of terminology, and in view of the extremely composite nature of epic philosophy we need not be in the least surprised to find a conglomerateof this side of Aupanisada views with genuine Samkhya, and the blend which the epic knows as Samkhya-Yoga, and which has the somewhat unfortunate appearance of an effort to reconcile the Upanisads and the Samkhya. 

An interesting and ingenious effort, however, has been made by Professor Edgerton* to establish the doctrine that the epic knows nothing of a Samkhyawhich denies the world soul or an Igvara, and that in it Samkhya and Yogado not denote philosophical systems but means of realizing that unity with the world soul, which is the aim of all philosophy in this period which is not materialistic. Samkhya denotes simply reflection doubtless its primary meaning and Yoga practicalexercises tending to produce the unity desired, the details in the Moksadharma showing that a sort of self-hypnosisis aimedat, while in the Gita the method is that of unselfish normal activityin the position of life in which fate has placed a man. Ingenious as this effort is, the denial of a specific Samkhya doctrine appears, on the whole, untenable. It compels us in the passagexii. 11037 ff. to render the words anlgvarah kathammucyet as* how the soul may be saved ', and to hold that in this passage nodistinction is being drawn between the views of Samkhya and Yoga, whichis to put an intolerable strain upon the language.2 Nor does it seem possible in xii. 11408 to render anfyvaram applied to the twenty-fifth principle merely as *supreme'; the term Ifvara in the preceding verse makes it clear that a contrast is intended.8 Another reference to the distinctive Samkhya insistence on a multitude of spirits must be seen in xii. 11483,4 and the whole matter appears clearly from xii. 13713 ff. In this passage we find two very distinct views set out : the Samkhya and the Yoga accept a multiplicity of souls, while Vyasainsists that all the souls at bottom rest on the world soul. To endeavour5 to explain away this obvious distinction by the theory that the real distinction is between a full and a brief exposition, and not between the views of Kapila and others and of Vyasa, is as unsatisfactory as the suggestion that adhytilina in the description of Kapila'sactivities means that he took thought on the supreme soul ; the reference is clearly to the soul only. Nor is there anything

544 The Philosophy of the Veda [Part v  

out of place1 in the allusion to the Yoga, for on the score of the multiplicity of souls Samkhya and Yoga in their classical forms agree. The effort also to remove the significance of the addition of a twenty-sixth principle in the Yogaon the score that, as Oldenberg2suggested, the new head serves merely to distinguish the souls as released, is clearly a tour deforce ; the twenty-sixth is I^vara, with whom, indeed, the enlightened soul may be identified.8 

In the very different view of Berndl4 the Samkhya system, as we have it in the Karika of Isvarakrsna and later, is a serious deviation from the true views of Kapila, who may have been the first teacher to express his views in prose. The original doctrine which denied any soul has been recast to meetBrahman prejudices, and has thus lost its definite character. Traces of the older view may be found in the assertion of the Mahabharata5 which gives number and matter, Prakrti, and twenty-four principles as the essence of the Samkhya. Originally the doctrine recognized only three Gu$as,4 Charactere ', whose interactions, themselves uncaused, since cause does not affect these things in themselves, produce the whole empirical world, which is ruled byabsolute necessity. The Gunas are not material, but are capable of mutualattraction, repulsion, and experience, and their interaction results in the formation of complexes (Empfindungszentren), which are selves, but which true knowledge shows are not distinct, eternal, metaphysical entities. Buteach is conscious of its essential relation to the Gunas, and this is expressed, subjectively, in the consciousness of transcendence, and, objectively, in the will to live and to maintain one's individuality. Space is an abstraction madeby the subject from the relations of things inter se and to itself, to whichthere corresponds only a manifold of heterogeneous sensations of quality, whichthe subject, by reason of the difference from its own homogeneity, experiences as something without. Time is also an abstraction made by the subject, to which alterations of external and internal conditions correspond, the groundfor distinguishing them being their different characters, those without being many and cutting across one another, while those which are internal are individualized and unified. The suggestion is ingenious, but it is perfectly clear that it is unhistorical. To eliminate Purusas as an essential feature opposed to Prakrti is to contradict everything we know of the Samkhya, andit is difficult to appreciate why the system should thus have been transformed, nor do the changes in the system of Empedokles made by Anaxagoras6provide

an adequate parallel. It is necessaryalso in BerndTs view to deny the doctrine of necessary periodical destruction of the universe, since all that is requisite is that, since things have originated, they cannot be permanent, and to question the early character of the marked pessimismof the Karika as incon 

sistent with the date of 700 or 800 B.C. ascribed to Kapila. A different view of the relation of the Upanisads and the Samkhya is presented by Professor Jacobi,1 whose latest view is that a distinct gulflies between the older Upanisads, and the middle and younger groups, terms which denote the Katha, lea, vetacvatara, Muncjaka and Mahanarayana, and the Pracna, Maitrayamya, and Mancjukya respectively. The middle groupis marked out from the oldest group by the absence of Aranyaka characteristics, the fact that the thought of the Upanisadsis no longerin the making but already expresses itself in characteristic verses and turns of phrase, and the metrical form, while, as Jacobi points out, there appearsin the middle andyounger groups a large number of technical terms of philosophicalinterest which are unknown to the earlier texts. In Jacobi's view there is also a vital philosophical difference between the two strata ; the middle and younger Upanisads are composedunder the direct influence of the Samkhya system which had come into being after the oldest Upanisads. The vital element in the new point of view is the manifestation of the belief in the doctrine of the personal immortality of the souls of men and other creatures conceived as monads or as a multiplicity of immaterial substances, this view being accom panied by the clear distinction of what was material and what was immaterial. The souls of the Samkhya are derived, in his view, from the aspectof the self as composed ofintelligence or consciousness (vijndnamayd)in the older Upanisads, but with the essential difference that the soul is no longer regardedas being derived from and merging on death into the Brahman. At the same time the being (sat) of the Chandogya Upanisad2 with its three constituents, which in the Upanisad are regardedas living, is distinguishedas purely material, and its constituents figure as the Gunas of the Samkhya, while the Buddhi of the Samkhya is a transformation of the vijndnaghana dtmd of Yajnavalkya, the whole somewhat bizarre conception being due to an effort at an early date to make a coherent system out of the confused thoughtsof the oldest Upani sads. This system was of influence, though it did not prove generally accept able. The middle and younger Upanisad groups representefforts to compro mise between the Samkhya with its kindred Yoga, and the pantheistic spirit of the Upanisads, an effort continued in the Bhagavadglta and the philosophical partsof the Mahabharata, and finally resultingin the compro mise of the Puranas. One doctrine, however, that of the personal immortality of the soul, became generally accepted, figuringin the Nyaya and Vai$esika schools,8 the Vedanta of Badarayana, and even the Purva Mlmansa,* as well

546 The Philosophy ofthe Veda [Partv   

as in Jainism. In the latter case the conception both of soul and matter seems to have been developed contemporaneouslywith the Samkhya views, though it is probable that the idea of the soul as essentially pure intelligence andimmortal was taken over by the Jains from some other doctrine, much of primitive hylozoism clinging to their view of the soul. 

This view has been acceptedas regards the origin of the theory of soul byProf. Stcherbatsky,1 who holds that the fact that the theory was rfew was the ground why it was so bitterlyassailed by the Buddhists, He admits that the idea of a surviving personalityis not unknown in the Veda, and that its essence and its relation to the Brahman are the main topic of discussion in the Upanisads.* But this self is a psychological entity,different explanations 

of its nature are proposed, and materialistic views are not excluded.2 Theidea of an immortal soul in our sense, a spiritual monad, a simple, uncomposite, eternal, immaterial substance is quite unknown in the Veda inclusive of the older Upanisads.' Most regrettablyneither Prof. Jacobi nor Prof. Stcher batsky has pointed out the passagesin the middle or younger Upanisads in which this new idea of an immortal soul is to be found, as contrasted with those in the older Upanisads ; and it appearsto me wholly impossibleto find any such distinction as real. The idea that at this periodin the historyof Indian thought the conceptionof an immortal soul was first introduced appears wholly without warrant, and to misunderstand entirely the course of development of Indian philosophy. 

The fact, of course, is that the primitive Vcdic belief clungto the doctrine of the survival of something after death, and that, therefore, immortality was no new idea. The view as to what survived was as hazy as it is to-day in popular and philosophic thought alike, for then, as now, it was practically impossible to form any intelligible conceptionof what a soul is, for such a description of the modern view as that given by Prof. Stcherbatsky cannot be said to have any intelligible meaning. But superinduced on this simple viewwe have the philosophicdoctrine passedoff under the name of Yaj fiavalkya, which asserts that the soul is not, as the ordinary man thinks, independent ; it is only a part of a greater whole or more accurately an aspectof that whole, so that at death there is no separateexistence in the sense of personal im mortality. That this view was ever generally acceptedin philosophiccircles is not suggested in the older Upanisads, and the middle arid younger Upanisadsshow that it was not attractive and that the tendency was to consider the matter more theistically, the absolute taking on a definitely personal appear ance and less stress being laid on merger in it, though it is essential to note that merger remains as a doctrine alongside with the contemplation of continued existence. But there is not the slightest trace of the advent of 

* The Central Conception of Buddhism (1923), based on Jacobi 's older suggestionof pp. 69 ff. materialism in CU. vi, which seems a That such views are allowed in the older tacitly revised in op.cit. 9 pp. 11 f. Upanisads seems an error, perhaps

personal immortality or the spiritual nature of the soul as new ideas in the period of the middle Upanisads ; the soul there remains a psychological entity exactly to the same extent as it was such an entity in the older 

Upanisads. 

Prof. Stcherbatsky, however, maintains that the old and the new soul theories were clearly distinguished ; thus all Buddhists rejected the doctrine of a self correspondingto the psycho-physical individual, Atmavada, but the Vatslputriyas and Sammitiyas accepted the theory of the doctrine of per manent soul, Pudgalavada. This basis of distinction, however, is clearly illegitimate, and is not given by the Buddhist texts ; instead the Pudgala is clearly a self correspondingto the psycho-physical individual, since it is main tained that it assumes new elements at birth and throws them off at death,1 and the other Buddhist schools justly rejected either doctrine, seeing throughthe subterfuge by which these two schools endeavoured, while evading direct contradiction of the master's insistence on Anatta, negation of a self, to preserve the existence of something which could transmigrate, thus preserving the reality of the doctrine of moral retribution, which utterly disappearsin the ordinary conception of Buddhism.2 Nor is there any plausibility in the view that the Katha Upanisad already recognizes what Prof. Stcherbatsky on dubious grounds claims to be the fundamental doctrine of Buddhism, the existence of Dharmas conceived as a plurality of subtle, ultimate, not further analysable elements of matter, mind, and force. The theory is based on the fact that in that Upanisad (iv. 14) we find a condemnation of him who sees Dharrnas separately (prthag dharmdn papyati), which is a very different thing from Stcherbatsky's rendering 'maintains the existence of separate elements '. The idea that Dharmas in this passageare'elements*is as implausible as that the term Dharma in i. 21 has this sense ; the word seems to mean in bothinstances something like'thing'as taken by Geiger,3 and this use harmoni/eswith dharmya as opposed to what is subtle (anu)in ii. 13, a passage ignored byStcherbatsky. With this rendering disappears wholly the idea that the author of the Katha is directing a polemic against a doctrine which denies boththe old and the new theories of the soul, or that Dharma is'a catchwordreferring to a new and foreign doctrine, some anatma-dliarma theory'. Noris there the slightest justification for the view that Panini*is aware of Buddhist and Samkhya views of causation, for his explanation of the use

548 The Philosophy ofthe Veda of samskrta and updkrtaor upasJcrta corresponds very poorly with this   

suggestion. 

Stcherbatsky1suggests further that from the Samkhya the Buddhists derived the incentive to the doctrine of the world as consisting of momentaryelements of mind, matter, and force. The Gunas of the Samkhya on this view are interpreted as fundamental principles, matter, mind-stuff, and energy stuff, acting as interdependent moments in every real and substantial exist ence ;fc the infinitesimals of energy, present everywhere,are semi-material ; although different from the inertia of matter and the luminosityof mind, they are separate and substantial '. The Buddhist elements arc a reply to the Samkhya by an architect of greaterskill. Ingeniousas this theory is, it depends, even if we accept the suggested view of the Buddhist Dharmas as primitive which seems impossible on the belief that the interpretation of the Gunas adopted is really that of the early Samkhya. This seems frankly impossible in view of the silence of the Samkhya texts and of the epicalike. The interpretationis based on the Yogabhasyaof Vyasa,2 who is a compara tively late author,3 and who shows every sign of influence by the Buddhist schools.4 To substitute his views for those of the origin of the Samkhya is as unwise as to adopt the doctrines of the Sarvastivadins, as expounded by Vasu banclhu, as representing the early doctrines of Buddhism from a philosophical point ofview. The same error marks the suggestion5 that the name of Samkhyais borrowed from Samkhya in the sense of Prajfia, that intellectual insight which destroys the infections (kiefas), through which the spiritis bound to con tinued existence. There can be no questionthat the epic6 explanationof the term as Parisamkhyana,* enumeration (of principles) ', is to be preferred to this suggestion, though it is still more probablethat in its earliest stage the termsimply referred to reasoning.

The veta$vatara, however, contributes an element which in the classical Yoga distinguishesit from the Samkhya, the presenceof a personal deity, though the figure of the god in the Upanisadis infinitely morevivid and important than that of the l?varaof the Yoga.This Upanisad, however, is distinctly marked by lack of clearness of conception, and attempts at harmonization of contrasting views. Recognizingthe strength of the popular religion which craved for aid from the gods, and in no wise satisfied with mere Yoga methods of securing the end desired, the vetaevatara intro duces into its systemthe conceptionof god. But in this introduction we find a repeated confusion between godas an addition to the empiricuniverse beside matter and spirits, and god as identical with the absolute. In the first sense* we have the conceptionof the absolute as comprehendingthe three ; god, who is the knower, the inciter to enjoyment,the lord ; spirit, the enjoycr, the ignorant, not the lord ; and nature, which is to be enjoyed by each spirit according to its merit or demerit. Two birds there are dwellingin one tree, one eats the sweet fruit, the other merely gazes011 the scene ; one, spirit,is dis tressed in contact with nature, but when it beholds the other, the lord, is freed from its woes. In the classical Yoga this picture presentsitself in the form of a god who is a special spirit untouched by the impurityof the world, byaction and its fruits, and who promotesthe freedom of unemancipated spirits. The objections to the later view are obvious ; how can there exist a god, whois not removed from all connexion with the world as is the released spirit, andyet is untouched by the misery of the world ? In the Upanisad, however, godhas a much more real existence ;he is hailed as Rudra2 and begged to spare the votary; he is invoked with the names of Mahe$vara, Kara, and fiva, andhe is identified at times with the Brahman, which, though also set above Rudra, is immediately after3expressly giventhe name of Lord,I^a,which is essentially that of Rudra. The end of man is to know, to see mysticallythis god, who is the magician4 who creates the universe in which the soul by illusion (mayo) is bound. He is the maker of all, all-knower, self-sourced, intelligent, the author of time, 6yet above the three times and impartite,6possession of quali ties, omniscient, the ruler of matter (pradhdna), and of the spirit, lord of qualities, the cause of transmigration and of liberation, of continuance and of bondage. When men shall roll up spaceas if it were a piece of leather, then only will there be an end of evil apart from the knowledge of god.7 

Knowledge of god is vouchsafed by the graceof the lord8 to him who has the highest devotion (bhakti) to god, and also to his spiritual teacher even as to i. 8-16; iv.6, 7. similar to those of Buddhism or the iii. 1-6 '; iv. 16, 18, 21, 22. later Sfcrfikhya.

god,1 a doctrine which suggests not the later Yoga, but the spirit of the Bhagavadglta and the general adoration of the teacher, as an essential part of the way of salvation, in the sectarian religions. 

The early Upanisadscontain no clear trace of the doctrine which is later found in the Buddhism of the Sarvastivadins,2 and which discriminates between the power of knowledge to remove causes of existence and that of ecstasy, assigning to the latter alone the powerof suppressingull material elements and all sensuous consciousness, knowledge dealing with mental elements and mental consciousness. Such a distinction has every appearance of being an excrescence on the original Buddhist doctrine, evoked by the desire to find a logical placefor ecstasy as opposed to mere knowledge, but it may have been earlyin appearing. 

Slight as is normally the recognitionin the Buddhist texts of the Brahmandoctrine of their rivals, Geiger3 has shown that the term Dhamma not rarely is used as a substitute, in expressing the Buddhist ideal, for the Brahman of the Upanisads, while the term Brahman itself is occasionally preserved.* The famous phrase* Wheel of the Law (dhamma-cakka)'is also paralleled by Brahma-cakka ;5 the Dhammayana by Brahmayana ;6 the Tathagata is not merely an incorporationof Dhamma but also of the Brahman, he has become not only the Dhamma but also the Brahman ;7 the Dhamma even claims the worship which is the lot of the Brahman in the Upanisads.8 Norin choosing the term Dhamma for the system was Buddhism without Upani sad precedent; the Brhadaranyaka9 tells that Brahman created the Dharma, than which nothing is higher, and the Mahanarayana10 asserts that the whole universe is encircled by the Dharma, than which there is nothing harder to describe. 

While it is, as has been seen, impossibleto acceptthe derivation of the Samkhya from a materialism, it is probablethat its realistic elements werepartly due to a contemporary tendency in this direction of which, not un naturally, we have no direct early evidence. The vetagvatara Upanisad, however, records upossible or actual theories of the absolute or final principle (brahman) which include necessity (niyati), chance (yadrcchd), time, inherent nature (svabhdva), matter (bhutdni), and spirit. In the records of Buddhism1S we have given to us as existing contemporaneouslywith the Buddha the doctrine of Ajita Kesakambalin, who was in effect a materialist, and who, according to the Jain tradition,14 believed, as did the Carvakas of the later tradition, in pleasureas the one end to be followed.

doctrine *certainly suggest that it was based on some degree at least on the principle enunciated by Yajnavalkya,2 that on dissolution of the body there exists in certain cases no consciousness, which, if the belief in the existence of the Brahman be removed, would result in a pure materialism, regarding the body as the reality of which life is a mere accompaniment, a view attributed also in Buddhist tradition3 to the king Payasi, who experimentallyestablished that soul did not survive bodily death. The records are important,since they 

show that the renunciation of belief in the Brahman could producematerialism as well as the Samkhya dualism and the negation of soul in Buddhism. The other principles enumerated by the vetavatara as possible theories are less important. Necessity figures also in the systemof Makkhali Gosala, while inherent nature appearsalso as an aspectof that system ;4 time has Vedic authority and persisted much later ;5 chance is rather an element in a system than an actual system,while the brevity of the allusion renders it obscure what particular doctrine is referred 

8. The Supreme and the Individual Souls 

In the philosophyof Yajnavalkya the identity of the supreme and the individual souls is carried to the extreme extent, but at the same time the term soul is deprivedof any distinct meaning. The identity of the soul of man and the absolute is due to the mere fact that, by reducing the soul to nothing save what may be termed the mere abstraction of subjectivity, or of the transcendental unity of apperception, the soul becomes nothing but an

aspect of a process.8 It is perfectly legitimate then to identify the supremeand the individual souls, but we arc really carried no further by this thanthe occasional remarks of the Brhadaranyaka Upanisad, which regards the universe as made up of nothing except subject and object.It is in fact perfectly true that all the world can be regardedas distinguishedas subject and object, but, unless we are able to show that this is the sum total of all that we can know, it is clearly impossiblefor philosophyto stop there. The actual existing world of thought, emotion, and action requires explanation andinvestigation. In the Vedanta the matter is solved comfortably by the doctrine of the two forms of knowledge : on the upper stage the identity of the self and the absolute is recognized, on the lower there is found to be a personal deity, Hiranyagarbha, and personal selves, who are indeed the absolute self, but fall under the influence of conditioning facts, the Upadhis, mind, the

The fact of this undue abstraction explains the view of one aspect of Buddhism in 

in so doing they naturally found them selves obliged to invent a substitute in the doctrine of Karman. The praise oc casionally lavished on their psychology without a soul is only conclusive of the philosophical crudity of the encomiasts.

senses, the vital airs, and the body, which, while in reality no more affecting the reality of the nature of the absolute than the red colour the rock crystal, nevertheless convert it into the self or soul, Jiva,1 of everyday humanity. In the Upanisads we naturally expect to find both sides of this doctrine, and wedo find them in pointof fact quite clearly expressed. On the one hand, wehave the constant efforts to show that there is but one self, that there is nomultiplicity and no change, which is pure idealism of a very intransigeant type, and on the other the reality of the individual self is constantly insisted upon. It is, however, constantly repeated that the individual and the absolute self are the same, and this is true no less in those cases where we may accept the view that idealism of the Yaj navalkya type is present, than in those, in whichthere is mere pantheismor cosmogonism. In the latter cases equallythere is no ground to distinguish ultimately between the selves, since at the most the individual is merely the absolute in another form. But even when the Upanisads are theistic in spirit, like the Katha and still more decidedly byfar the vetavatara, they never reach the view that the supreme and the individual souls are anything reallydifferent. The Katha,2 however, is marked by its clear enunciation for the first time of the conceptionof the enjoyer as the union of the self with mind and the senses. It also describes the two aspects of the souls as light and shadow, while in the vetavatara3 we find the metaphor of the two birds on a tree, one eating the sweet berries, the other merely gazing downwards, without eating.It also developsthe idea of the individual soul, as endowed with the faculty of framing concepts and resolves, individualism and intellect, as enjoying the fruit of action, as small as a thumb in height, or a needle's point, or the ten-thousandth partof the tip of a hair, which is yetidentical with the infinitely great supreme soul, a statement which is clearly identical in essence with the Vedanta position as seen in Qaiikara. 

The cause of the appearancein this restricted form of the supreme soul is given by ankara as the effect of ignorance, and with him that explanation ends the matter, since it is impossibleto go further than this. In the Upanisads, apart from the many creation legends which yield no philosophic result, the actual nature of the problemis rarely expressed and very slightly explained. The view of the Pra$na4is that breath is born from the self, andit is likened to the shadow on a man. Unhappily the rest of its explanation is obscure : if rendered according to grammar, it distinctly says that the position is involuntary (manokrta) on the partof the self : the version of Sayana, which is defiant of grammar, takes it that the result is produced bythe previous acts of the will of the man in question ; it is possible that wemust amend so as merely to saythat the mind attaches itself to the breath, but this suggestion of Bohtlingk's5 is doubtful, and the best plan seems to be

Chap. 28] The Supreme and the Individual Souls 553  

to recognize that the process is not voluntary, which is in agreement with the Vedanta view. In the Maitrayaniya,1 which is influenced by the Samkhyaviews of the constituents of nature, the doctrine is laid down that the self is overcome by the Gunas, and falls into an illusion in which it becomes weak, disordered, sensual, and believes in the separate existence of the self, fettering itself by its own action like a bird by its nest, while an addition2 to that text gives the different conception, that the supreme soul becomes individual, in order to experiencelife in the world as well as eternal verity. 

The description of the partsof the individual souls in the Upanisads is far from uniform or homogeneous. In the Samkhya, as we have seen, it is a union of the individual spirit with the elements of intellect, individuation, mind, the live organs of intelligence and the five organs of action, and the subtle elements as well as the fine partsof the gross elements. In the Vedanta the position is not essentially different : the soul is the absolute enveloped in the Upadhis : in this case they are mind,3 the ten senses, the five breaths, whichare the organs of nutrition, and the subtle body, that is the subtle partsof the elements which form the seeds of the body. In both cases there must be addedthe psychic disposition which causes the kind of rebirth and secures that rebirth, the Bhava of the Samkhya, the Karman of Qankara. 

In the Upanisads the terminology centres mainly in the word Prana, which every now and then, as we have seen, is treated as a synonym of the absolute, but which on the whole is more normally of less consequence. ThePrana often represents the senses, but the numbers of Pranas, into whichit is divided, differ greatly: the origin of the various calculations maycertainly be traced in partat least to the Atharvaveda,4 where we are told of the head as a drinking bowl with seven seers in the apertures: the sense ascribed to the seven appearsto have been the eyes, ears, nostrils, and the organ of taste, for the Brhadaranyaka Upanisad6 adds to the seven aneighth in the form of speech. The Upanisads normally enumerate a series of five,6 breath, eye, ear, mind, and speech, but these arc sometimes reduced to four or less ; thus the Jaiminiya Upanisad Brahmana repeatedly dwells on the series, speech, mind, sight, hearing, and the breath or breaths ; the cosmic parallels arc fire, moon, sun, the quarters (i. e. space), and wind. A different view is that of a passage of the Brhadaranyaka Upanisad,7 where the organs

of smell, speech, tongue, eye, ear, mind, hands, and skin are enumerated as the eight Grahas, and the corresponding objects, odour, name, taste, form, sound, desire, action, and touch are set over against them as the Atigrahas, possibly an indication, since Graha may mean seizer, that the soul was

fettered by the organs and their activities, an idea carried out in the phrase ' bands of the heart *, which is first found in the Chandogya Upanisad.1 Thelater term Indriya is first found in the Kausitaki Upanisad,2 when on death the father hands over to his son his speech; smell; eye; ear; tastes; actions ; pleasure and pain; bliss, delight, and procreation; movements; mind; andintellect (prqjnd), where the usual later enumeration of ten with mind is followed, with one exception. In the Brhadaranyaka Upanisad8 we find the skin as the uniting-placeof touch ; the tongue of tastes ; the nose of odours ; the eye of forms ; the ear of sounds ; the mind of conceptions (samkalpa) ; the heart of knowledge ; the hands of actions ; the generative organof pleasure; the anus of procreation; the feet of movements; and speechof the Vedas ; but the name, Indriya,is not used. The normal later total of ten with mind, including the heart, as Indriyas is found in the Pra^na,4 in a passage which also enumerates the five subtle elements, the five gross elements, intellect, individuation, thought, brilliance, and breath. 

It is of importancein the history of Indian philosophyto note the develop ment of the sense of Manas,' mind '. In the earliest period, and in the Brahmanas, and even in the Upanisads, mind is a vague term5 denotingcon sciousness generally, whether feeling,6willing, or thinking, and it can be used as a synonym for Prajapati, when it is sought to reduce that figure to some thing more abstract and less mythological. From that use it is later sometimes definitely minimized to mean the power which forms ideas and decisions, but it is probably in the wider and less precise sense that it still appearsin all the old lists of the breaths beside speech, eye, ear, and breath. The more limited meaning is possiblein cases where mind is said to be the uniting placeof con ceptions, the heart of knowledge, or mind discriminates names, and intellect (prajnd) deals with thoughts, what is to be understood, and desires.7 On the other hand, there clearly evolves itself, as in Epicharmos'doctrine : vofs opfj KO\ vovs aKovt, TttAAa /cciM^a KOL Tv<Aa the idea that the presenceof the mind, atten tion in fact, is necessary to see, to hear, and so forth. Desire, judgement, belief, doubt, unbelief, firmness, weakness, modesty, knowledge, fear, all these depend on the mind. Mind therefore is regardedas forming into ideas the impressions of the senses, sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch, and it then as will motived by desire transforms the ideas into resolves, which

are carried out by the organs of action. It is the mind which drives man to beget on his wife a son,1 the Brhadarariyaka Upanisad2 also says. Similarly the mind is the cause of all action of every kind, sacred study,or the gaining of wealth. In the metaphor of the chariot and the driver, the body and

the soul, in the Katha3 the intellect is the charioteer, mind the reins, and the senses are only the horses. One of the selves in the doctrine of five selves in the Taiittiriya Upanisad*is expressly called the mind-made self, and its object is sacrificial activity. The Maitrayamya Upanisad5develops the chariot metaphor further ; the whip is nature, the horses the organs of action, the reins the organs of intellect, and the driver is mind who with his whip stirs the steeds to action under the control of the reins.6 

The mind is specially concerned with Samkalpas, a term which appears only in a late passage of the Rigveda,7 but is later frequent. The root idea is putting in order, so that a Samkalpa or conception may be equallywell anidea or a decision, though in fact the word is frequently used with an implica tion of will. Mind is the abode of all Samkalpas,8 but with the usual inconsis tency we have Samkalpa ranked above mind, the product above the function.9 Mind is fundamental ; what one desires with it is Kratu, conscious will. 

Beside mind we find sometimes the term Citta, which in the Pali Canonis often a synonym for mind.10 The term cit denotes from the Rigveda on to notice something, whether by th'e sense organsor by mental activity ,;in the Chandogya u we find Citta, what is noticed, placed above Samkalpa which in its turn is superior to rnind ;a contrast is drawn between the man who knowsmuch and has no Citta, and who is accordingly little regarded, and him whohas Citta and, therefore, is in high repute. In the sense of thought as anactivity Citta is later in use, beside Citti and Cetas, and occasionally mindand Citta or Cetas arc directlyidentified.12 The term Citta becomes of special importance later in the Yoga system. 

Vijnana, discriminating knowledge, which is made a synonym of mind in the Pali Canon, is sometimes merely a function of mind,13 but it also occurs not rarely in the older Upanisadswith a distinct implicationof a superior form of knowledge to the mere action of mind ; thus hearing, thinking, and discrimi

nating, or seeing, thinking, and discriminating, are enumerated, and in the final doctrine, which denies the possibility of knowing that which knows all, the term used is vijnd.1 But this idea is not formally developed, in accord ance with the whole spirit of the Upanisads. 

On the side of feeling the terminology of the Upanisads marks a great advance in the normal employment of Sukha to denote pleasure generically and Dufckha, based upon it, for misery. A generic term to cover beth forms of feeling is not found before the Vedana of the Pali texts. But we have the definite statement 2 that, when a man experiences pleasure, he acts, when he experiences pain, he refrains from action, while the Kausitaki3 asserts that pleasure and pain are felt by means of the body. 

Of more philosophicalinterest are efforts made to render more precise the functions of the senses. Thus the Brhadaranyaka Upanisad4 in the doctrine above cited, of eight graspers, or apprehenders (grahas), and eight that are beyond (ati) the graspers, givesas pairs Prana and Apana,the former 

being used to smell odours ; speech and names ; the tongue and tastes ; the eye and visible forms (rilpa) (i. e. coloured extension) ; the ear and sounds ; the mind and desires ; the hands and action ; and the skin and feelings of 

touch.6 In the Kausitaki6 we have speech and name as its external correlate ; breath (i.e. smell) and odour ; eye and visible form ; the ear and sound ; the tongue and tastes ; the two hands and action ;the body and pleasure andpain ; the organ of generation and bliss, delight, and procreation ; the twofeet and movements ;and the intellect and thoughts, what is to be under stood, and desires. The Jaiminiya Upanisad Brahmana7 has a series of ten : mind and matters requiring examination (pariksya) ; speech (i.e. the tongue)8 and tastes ; breath and odours ; the eye and visible forms ; the ear and sounds ;

the skin and contacts (samsparga) ; the hands and actions ; the belly andhunger ; the penis and joys ; and the feet and roads. These ten are for maneither heavens or hells, accordingto their operation. 

Beyond these parallelisms the relation of sense and objectis left unde termined. The use of the expressions Graha and Atigraha might be held to suggest the view that sense seeks out its object and masters it, and the samedoctrine may be found in the Aitareya1 and Kausltaki Upanisads.2 In the Katha Upanisad 3 we find that the objects are placed above the senses, whichmight be the sense of the first element in Atigraha, but also that the senses are the steeds and the objects their field of action. A more penetrating analysis is to be found in another passageof the Kausltaki Upanisad,4 where a set of ten senses 5 and their objectsis drawn up,similar to that above cited. In it the objects arc described as the external existential elements, Bhutamatra,correlated to the senses. The process of knowledge is then described by the metaphor of one mounting the object by means of intellect, Prajfia whichfor the Kausltaki is theprius from which both senses and objects are derived and thus attaining it. The senses are declared in similar detail to be uncon scious without the presenceof intelligence ; the rule is applied even to mind, which here stands in the place of an organ and has as its object thoughts, whatis to be understood, and desires. The passage, however, is characteristic of the somewhat complex and late character of the Upanisad,for the reason given why the other senses are unable to act without intellect is the fact that mind, in the absence of intellect, is elsewhere. Stress is laid on the necessary connexion of existential elements and intellect-elements, Praj namatra ; if there were no existential elements, there would be no intellect-elements andvice versa, and without the co-operationof both, no appearance (rupa) whatever would be brought about, the term appearancedoubtless standing here as an example of visual cognition and applyingto all the other forms of cognition enumerated. At the same time insistence is laid on the fact that there is no ultimate diversity ; as the felly rests on the spokes, and the spokes in the hub, so the existential elements rest on the intellect elements, and they again are fixed inPrana, which is identified by the Upanisadwith the intellect self, Prajnatman.6 

This doctrine obviously is more metaphysical than psychologicalin interest, and goes a very little way to solve the questionof the nature of perception or sensation. This is further borne out by the failure to make clear what is meant by senses as opposed to objects ; later we find in the Sarhkhya7 a

distinct recognition of the difference between function and the material organ, the faculty of hearing,for example, and the gross ear, but such a distinction is nowhere hinted at in the Upanisads, and it is uncertain how the matter wasregarded in them. In the later texts we find two different theories represented: on the one hand, in the Samkhya philosophy1 there is a consistent andharmonious materialism of process which, however, is made conscious only by the intervention of the Purusa, which is the equivalentin that system of the Atman of the Vedanta. On the other hand, in the Vcdanta, as interpreted byGaudapada,2 stress is laid on the fact that ultimately the visions of a dreamand those of our waking state cannot be absolutely distinguished: if the dream apparitions arc truly produced by the activity of the Atman, so in the case of waking states the objects are equally produced by the Atman : the thing and its representation condition each other : each separately has noexistence : they exist only in the Atman, a position which, though differen tiated by Qankarafrom the idealism of the Buddhist Vij Mnavada, tends indefinitely to merge into it. As against these clear theories, which recognize the problem of ideal and real or even material factors in knowledge and supply their varying solutions, we have in Buddhist texts3 of the earlier period a theory of contact which in the Milindapanha4is frankly materialist and wasdoubtless so ab initio, but which at any rate seems not to have appreciated the real question involved. It is to this confused species of thought that we mustin the main turn in considering the views of the Upanisads: the haziness of their ideas is shown conclusively by the fact that often, as later in Buddhism,organ and function seem hardly consciouslyto be separatedin their concep tion of the activities of sense. Neither realism nor idealism can be said to beyet clearly held. If, as we have seen, in the Kausltaki Upanisad6 we find all existential elements, &c., referred to and made dependent on consciousness, i. e. apparently a subjective idealism, yet in the Madhyandina recension of the Brhadaranyaka Upanisad6 we expressly hear of the Atman that after death it is not possessed of empirical consciousness, because it is not in contact with Matra, which is most naturally interpreted as a realist or materialist concep tion, somewhat like that of the Samkhya, such consciousness arising from the contact of the mind and matter, but the term Matra may have a wider sense of all empirical existence. Similarly there is abundant evidence of a naive realism, which placesside by side the facts of the macrocosm and the micro cosm without suggestion that there is any but a real relation.

of the cosmic order (adhidaivata) with the disposition of man (adhydtma) is constant and wearisome ; the spacewithin the heart is parallel to cosmic space ;1 the breath of man to the wind,2 the speech to fire, the eye to the sun, the ear to the moon, the mind to the lightning ;8 there are five cosmic spaces, five gods of nature, five classes of beings, and correspondingly we have five vital airs, five senses, five partsof the body ;4 to name, form, and action in the world correspond speech, sight, and man in the individual ;5 there is Dharma,law, and truth for the world and for the man, and the macrocosm and the micro cosm are interrelated in an indissoluble union of reciprocal service and support.6 The general attitude of the TJpanisadsmust, therefore, be described as realistic, and, accordingly, not incompatible with a rejection of the subjective idealism of the Vijnanavadins. Here and there this interpretation suggestsitself with special force, as when it is expressly made clear that the Atman is the real active force in seeing,in smelling,in speaking,in hearing,in thinking, and the senses are but means,7 or againthe Atman is picturedlike the ocean as the abode of all the sense activities.8 From the Saihkhya view the Upanisads are distinguished in an important respect, the frank recognition accorded by themof the activity of the Atman,9 while in the Samkhya view the Purusa has really no activity, though paradoxicallyall consciousness is made to dependon the imaginary connexion of the Pumsa with Prakrti. 

There is, naturally enough, no trace in the Upanisadsof any clear apprecia tion of the distinction between mere sensation and ideas such as Dignagamade distinct in his doctrine of sensation as without operationof abstract thought (kalpandpodha)as opposedto definite cognition (savikalpaka) though, in a sense, this distinction might be held to be latent in the contrast noted above of the senses and the mind as sources of knowledge. This fact renders it most improbable, a priori, that11 * from the very beginning Bud dhism had established this difference : vijndna and its synonyms, citta, manah, represent pure sensation, the same as the kalpanapodha pratyaksaof Dignaga, and sanjnd correspondsto definite ideas *.

thus of treating Vijfianain the scheme of the five Skandhas must have been slow ; it is emphatically not reached by the Pali texts of the Canon,1 and, like all refined conceptions, can be attributed to early Buddhism only at the expense of historical truth. 

Naturally it might be expected that from an examination of the relation of the Atman to the questionsoftime and space some light would be cast on the aspect in which the Atman was viewed. But unfortunately the' account of time in the Upanisadsis quitevalueless from the pointof view of philosophy : in the Atharvaveda we have Kala set forth as the highest principle of the universe, and the waters and even Prajapatiare derived from it.2 In the Upanisads we have little more than this : an affectedly obscure passagein the later part of the Maitrayanlya Upanisad8 exalts time as beingthe Brahman,the highest principle, the source of all that is ; the veta,vatara4 mentions time, nature, necessity, accident, material, and spirit as various rival theories of being, but declares time as past, present, and future to be inferior to the Brahman ; and the Brhadaranyaka Upanisad6 derives time from the Brahman, and declares it to be lord of the past and the future. In the viewof afikara,6 while time is absolutely non-existent in the true sense of existence, since all but the one is illusion, time, space and causality are in themselves onthe standpoint of the lower knowledge truly real ; but it is perfectlyclear that in the case of the Upanisadsthe nature of time has not received any real 

investigation. 

A more favourable view of the achievement of early Indian philosophyis taken by F. Otto Schrader,7 who contends that the distinction between the ordinary or empiric and a higheror transcendental time can be traced backto the Kala hymns of the Atharvaveda and is recognizablein the epicin such phrases8 as' Time leads me in time '. With this distinction he connects the declaration of the Maitrayanlya Upanisad regarding the time that has parts, and is later than the sun and the stars, and the non-time which is without parts, and is earlier, and the distinction later made between time which cooks, or matures, all beings and him in whom time is matured. Later doubtless we dofind developed the doctrine that the changing time which we observe in daily life is only time as an effect (kdryakdla), the cause of which is a time without sections (akhandakdla) and unchanging, and that there must be a sphereor

condition which is totally unaffected by time, though time exist in it as aninstrument. But there seems no real reason why we should ascribe any of these developed conceptionsto the Upanisad period.1 

The same remark applies even more strongly to space, the conceptionof which can hardly be said to be fully apprehended in the Upanisads. The termAkaa, which is rendered4 ether'in accordance with the established usage, denotes in* the opinionof Bohtlingk2 the empty space, the elements Vayuand Akaga, representing wind and atmosphere, corresponding to the Greek difc, there being no idea to correspond with the ether of the Greek view. TheAka$a was conceived, in his view, as empty space, the atmosphere as opposedto the wind not being regarded as corporeal. Whether this view is correct can not be determined with certainty from the evidence : it can be made com patible with whatever is said regarding Akaga, but on the other hand it is notclear that this conception is always adequate. The term Aka^a first appearsin the Brahmana style, and denotes room or space through which one can pass or into which one can thrust a finger.3 Further, the space between the sky and the earth when they separated is the Antariksa or atmosphere,4 and, in contrast to the wind, Vayu, which as an element is normally rendered air, at the cost of some confusion of idea, the atmosphere is regarded as something empty,being compared in the Taittiriya Samhita6 to not-being. On the other hand, just as not-being is in a sense something concrete, the Aka^a is more than merespace. Man, the Kausitaki6 tells us, is born from the Aka^a as from a womb; when fire heats the Akaga, then rain falls, in the view of the Chandogya ;7 the Taittiriya8 makes the Aka^a born from the self, and from the Aka^a the wind is born. Yet in it arc the sun and the moon, lightning, stars and fire ; by means of it one calls, hears and answers ; in it a man is born, and has joy ; in it he meets a woman.9 Thus the Akaga approaches the sense of space, though a material space, but it seems that it does not denote space in the mostgeneral sense, but rather the space between the sky and the earth, which is around us.10 The idea is evidently a considerable advance on the mythological presentation of the quartersas divinities, which tends here and there to pass over into an attempt to express spaceas opposed to time, symbolized by the seasons.11 The combination of the terms, Di$ and Aka^a, appearsin the Maitrayaniya Upanisad,12 which describes Aka^a as a lotus flower whose leaves are the four quarters and the four intermediate quarters or cardinal points.

have, however, in the fact that ether is treated regularly as one of the five elements a warning against regarding it as essentially distinct in the view of the Upanisads from the other more obvious material elements.1 Yet it must benoted that in Buddhism no serious advance was made in attempting to under stand the nature of space ; it was for some unintelligible reason excluded fromnon-derived Rupa,2 and, when the Andhakas claimed that the room betweenobjects was perceptible,this view was rejected, a defect which has been traced to the failure of Buddhism to investigate the true function of mind.3 

The position with regardto causalityis the same. In the Samkhya systemand in the Buddhist the category of causality is regarded as truly existing, andthe Samkhya quite seriously applies the doctrine of causality as enablingit to determine the nature of its final principles: the things of empirical life are referred ultimately to one ground in nature, Prakrti, while again the unfolding of nature is essentially relative to some principlefor whose advantage it takes place, which is the Purusa. In the Upanisads a theory of causalityis not to befound, and the early texts have not the term, Karana; nor is this remarkable : in effect the Brahman is essentially above all cause : when the categories of place, time, substance, and cause disappear, then the Brahman remains over, as it is said in a very late text.* The Chandogya Upanisad5 uses the idea of root and shoot to convey the idea of derivation. 

Imperfect, however, as are the views of the Upanisads on these points, the defects of their theories must not be exaggerated. The amount of progress made in developing speculation on these questionsfor many centuries after was very slight, as can be seen from even a brief glanceat the Buddhist theory of sense as developedin the Pali Nikayas. In that theory the chief difference is unquestionably the effort to do without a self at all, which was clearly one aspect of the Buddhist faith, though by no means the only aspect and certainly in the long run not the most important. But apart from the odium theologicum it is impossible to grant this attempt any real validity at all :7 it would havebeen easy to show that the conceptionof the Atman attained by the Brahmanswas inadequate, but it was merely a retrogression to solve the problem byignoring its existence : there is nothing in the Nikayas to suggest the mostmoderate competence in treating of the matter, the whole Buddhist position

being rendered easy by the illegitimate assumption, whenever necessary, of the subject which is denied. It is an elementary fact that a sensation is nothing if not an experience for an individual being, and, while for a definite scientific purpose we are doubtless free, if we will, to ignore the subjective factor, if we carry this ignoringinto the field of philosophy, we deal with a false abstraction ; nor is it less false because it has appealed to the enthusiastic, butconfused inind of William James.1 The Upanisads frankly do not face the question of memory, but leave it a possibility. But even in the Abhidhammathe problem of reinstatement and the conditions of reinstatement are not raised as matters callingfor definition.2 If even we go to a far later period, a formula 3 like'the upspringingof potential cittas, not empty and mutuallydisconnected, but each fraught with the informing satti of this or that amongformer citta continua ', appears both clumsy and question-beggingas a sub stitute for the conception of a real unity in multiplicity, since a citta continuumis clearly impossible without such a unity. 

Nor is any progress made in the analysis of consciousness. It is true4 that in place of the occasional remarks of the Upanisads we find in the Buddhist texts interminable repetitions of the same facts regarding all the senses which are, therefore, more definitely recognized than in some portions of the Upanisads, but any real progressin defining sense perception remains to be pointed out. On the contrary, we have the old view which makes no clear distinction if any at all between the organ and the sensation, and as late as the 

Milindapaiiha, as we have seen, sensation is expressedin terms of merematerial contact. The position of mind, Mano, remains precisely what it wasin the Upanisads : it is wholly erroneous6 to compare it with the sensus com munis of Aristotle, whose two special functions,6 that of self-consciousness and

of consciousness of the common sensibles, by no means correspond with those of Mano, which is rather in origin a power without which the senses would in effect not perceive at all, and which in a more effective psychology might havebeen developed into the psychical representative of sensation conveyedthrough the physiological apparatus.7 Even the position of touch as in somesense the most fundamental of the senses which is claimed for the Dhamma samgani can hardly be accepted as in any way a really scientific theory, as it is only enunciated in company with an extraordinarily unintelligible doctrine of the position of what is somewhat hypothetically interpretedas the cohesive element.8 The primitive nature of the process of consciousness as conceived in the Nikayas is obvious from the stereotyped account of the origin of

knowledge.1 Through the eye and visible form arises visual consciousness : the collision of the two factors is contact : conditioned by contact arises feel ing : what one feels one perceives: what one perceives one thinks about : whatone thinks about one is obsessed withal. The crudeness and valuelessness of the theory is obvious at once from the very fact that it is wholly impossible to understand what precise sense was attributed to the several terms, for the explanations of the scholiast are in all likelihood nothing but the'interpreta tions of later generationsof thinkers, who had to do their best to make the most out of the tradition of the text. The Buddhists too remain with the Upanisads on the basis of the dwellingof the soul or its equivalentin the heart,2 which is thus broughtinto the theoryof sensation. What is indeed of interest is not the developmentof doctrine in the Nikayas, which give us only a few changes in terminology such as the metaphorof the doors of the senses,8 but the extraordinary persistencein Buddhism of the psychologyof the 

Upanisads. 

In addition to the mind and the sense organs, the soul possesses the breaths or vital airs. Prana, originally'breath ', then used often as a name for the absolute, is in the Upanisads a constant expressionfor the whole sum of the organs of sense, and at the same time a special one breath, beside eye, car, mind, and speech. It, however, in the growing development of the doctrine of mind and the organsof sense is gradually reduced to minor importance, and

becomes concerned not with the intellectual aspectof the soul, but with the principle of life as opposedto intellect. The singlePriiria in this aspectis divided into five, which, however, are also sometimes given as two,4 Prana andApana, as three,5 these with Vyana, or four,6 these with Udana. The Jaimi mya Upanisad Brahmana gives Prana, Apana, Vyana, Samana, Avana, andUdana ; or seven in the head, or nine, including two below, and a tenth in the navel.7 The precise sense of these terms has been much disputed, but it is not open to serious doubt that alone Prana or Apana may mean breath simply, whether in or out, and therefore Prana may mean smell.8 In contrast, how

ever, they are on the one hand expiration, on the other inspiration. Apana,however, has the definite sense of the downward wind, which presides over evacuation in not a few passages ; it also often denotes smell. Vyana is the bond of union of the two, that is either the power which maintains life whenneither expiration nor inspiration takes place, or the breath connecting the upper and the lower breaths. Samana is not clearly defined : it is said to connect expiration and inspiration, which seems needless ; or to assimilate food. Udana conducts the soul from the body on death, or leads in deep sleep to the Brahman. 

But, besides these psychical and physiological elements, in the later view, the soul has, as individual, certain other permanent entities, the elements, and a mind-disposition attached to it. It is clearlyl in one place regarded at death as being connected with earth, water, wind, ether, and fire and its 

opposite, and also with desire and its opposite, anger and its opposite, andjustice and its opposite, as well as with the organs. The same idea seems in metaphorical form to be found in the view2 that for rebirth the waters are five times offered in sacrifice as faith, the Soma, rain, food, and seed to becomea man. The term Linga found in a verse added here is apparently usedtechnically to denote the entity which transmigrates as early as the Katha3 at least, and in the Maitrayanlya Upanisad4 it has its full technical sense. Much more often, however, we hear of the moral qualities and power of remembrance of the self which go on the journey of transmigration. 

Of the gross body we learn that the scat of the breaths, of the mind, andeven of the organs of sense is really in the heart, where in sleep the organs remain and where in death they gather : nay, the heart is even identified withthe Brahman, and is essentially its home : the name hrdayam is derived fromhrdy ayam,' he here in the heart '.5 In the golden lotus of the heart is the ether in which heaven and earth, sun, moon, and stars arc enclosed, into which

the soul enters in sleep, and in which the immortal golden Purusa resides.1 It is the cavity in which the Brahman is concealed. Round the heart are the veins 72,000 in number,2 and these, by another turn of thought, are conceived as of five colours, uniting with the rays of the sun similarly coloured and thus connecting1 the sun and the heart. In deep sleep the soul glides into the veins and through them it becomes one with the heart. At death the soul is con ceived as passing out by the veins, and the rays of the sun, which the wise find open to them, while the entrance is closed to the ignorant.3 By yet another turn of thought4 the conceptionis reached that only one vein leads to the sun out of 101, the vein in question leadingto the head, presumablyin connexion with the fact that there is the suture, the Brahmarandhra,6 through whichin the process of creation the Brahman is supposedto enter the body as spirit. Later accounts such as that of the Pra^na6merge the two versions of 72,000 and 101 veins into one, the 101 veins having each 100 branches, each of which

has 72,000 sub-branches, in all 727,210,201. 

The body itself is derived from the three elements, recognizedin the Chan dogya Upanisad 7 by the rule that the dense parts become the coarse (faeces, urine, bone), the medium the medium (flesh, blood, marrow), constituents of the body, and the finest the mind, breath, and speech, correspondingto food or earth, water, and heat. The soul is nourished by the blood massed in the heart, thus enjoying purer (pravivikta) food than the gross body.8 The pro duction of the body is traced to the seed of the father,9 and different views of the nature of the processof generation can be traced ; in the simplest formit is said that the seed is the self of the father, which enters the woman andbecomes part of herself;10 but it is also said, in more exact accordance n with the doctrine of the transmigrationof souls, that the seed is merely a stage onthe course of the rebirth of the soul, which in the moon has exhausted its good works : it comes down through the ether, the wind, smoke, rain, plants, seed, and the mother's womb, in each of which it of course has merely a tem porary habitation : from yet another point of view12 the cause of procreation is the desire for reunion of the two halves of the same being originally united, but divided as male and female by Prajapati. But the primitive view of the Upaiiisads is clear that the productionof offspringis a religious duty, which was inculcated on the student at the close of the studentship: a chapter on how to secure certain qualities in the child is incorporatedin the Brhada ranyaka Upanisad13 probablyfor this very reason.

is clear proof of the gradual advance of the spirit of asceticism, in complete harmony with the fact that the knowledge of the Atman shows that all desires for children to continue the race, to discharge the debt to the Fathers, to expiate the faults of their parentsin life, are idle and foolish. The Brahmans,who have known the self, are twice declared in the Brhadaranyaka Upanisad1 to have held aloof from the desire of children,' What need have we of off spring, whose soul is the universe ?'By a bizarre conception, found here only in the late Garbha Upanisad,the embryo in the ninth month is conceived as remembering all its previousbirths and its good and evil deeds, a remembrancewhich is taken from it by the pangsof birth.2 

In addition to creatures born alive, other creatures exist born from a germor shoot (udbhid), born from eggs, and born from moisture like insects and so forth. These ideas which are found only in two passagesin the Upanisads8 are decisive for later philosophy, but their connexion with the theories of the Upanisads is nowhere indicated. 

9. The Four States of the Soul 

The soul, despiteits close connexion with the body, which we have traced in detail, is also enabled by its nature to approach closely the absolute. Thespirit is most remote from the absolute in its normal waking activities : in that case the senses and the mind are at work, but when there is sleep the senses and the mind are merged in the breath. A further distinction is then made between the condition of the soul in the sleep of dreams, and in deep dreamless sleep, in which the soul enters into the purest light, and then as a consequence of its own nature emerges again from it. These three stages alone are found in the oldest Upanisads, and it is not till the latest Upanisadsthat a fourth is added in accordance with the constant tendency further to 

subdivide. 

The philosophical importanceof the doctrine4 lies in the effect which the investigation of the stages of the soul must have had on the conception of the soul itself. The earlyidentification of the soul with Prana as breath musthave been suggested by the fact of the permanenceof the breath despite the cessation in sleep of the activities of the mind ; death overcomes the voice, the eye, the ear, but while these are sunk in sleep the breath perishes not.6 It is a further step, but one intelligible enough,to the conclusion6that, though the body perishesin death, yet the breath remains, for the breath is invisible and there is, therefore, no ground to assume that the falling to pieces of the body affects its being. We attain thus the conceptionof the self as

something which does not perish, which, therefore, is without beginning andwithout end, and as the essential element in man we find all activities resolved ultimately into Prana on their cessation. On a higherlevel of thought we havethe concept Prajfta, intelligence, substituted for the breath, in recognition of the psychic side of man and of the fact that it is consciousness or intelligence which is aware of breath and of all man's life, and in it also all else is resolved. Advancing still further on the path of abstraction, we attain the* concept of the Atman as that which knows, without possessing any empiric object, suggested inevitably by the condition attained in deep dreamless sleep. Theidentity of such an Atman with the Brahman is obviously an easy step, andthis may well have been a factor in achieving the identification. Obviously also the tendency to attain the unity in question by means of artificial pro cesses of mental suppressionarises immediately from the desire to imitate artificially the condition achieved in deep sleep, but under natural conditions inevitably only for a limited period, and subject to the possibility of dreams. 

In the waking state the man uses all his faculties and is confronted by a real world, but the waking state is in reality merely a dream condition, since it has not true reality, and the man who is awake is really furthest removed from the clear knowledge usually attached to the waking condition. Hence in the Aitareya Upanisad* we find three sleeps or dreams mentioned which may well be the three states, the first regarded as dreaming no less than the other two. In the case of a dream, however, the outer world is not there :2 there are nocarts, horses, roads, but he makes them for himself; there is no joy, happiness, nor desire, but he makes them for himself ; wells, pools, and streams also hefashions for himself. The spirit serves as lightfor itself in this condition. From another point of view3 the primitive idea of the absence of the mindduring sleep is recognized, and a warning given not lightly to waken the sleeper, lest he not easily find his way back to the body. These two views, the activity of the self in the body in sleep, and the journeying of the self from the body, are united in a third4 which pictures the self as engaged in the process of wandering through his own body here and there. The vital spirits are then treated as being his subjects, who attend him in his movements, like a king, through the realm of his body. The nature of the dream consciousness is shown also by the Upanisads to be closely connected with the character of the consciousness which was enjoyed in the waking life, and which thus is the material (mdtrd) on which the soul acts ; what a man feared might happento him, to be slain, to be flayed, to be trampled on by an elephant, or plungedinto a pit, all these ideas crowd in upon him.6 In the Pra9na6 the whole

process of dreaming is a review of what has been experienced in the wakingstate. 

From the ordinary process of dreaming sleep a transition is made to deepsleep, when the soul advances more closely to the world to come, and from the mere consciousness of individual things, such as the conceptof being a king or a god, becomes conscious of itself as the universe, in which case, however, there is no longer any possibility of contrast between subject and object, andordinary consciousness is superseded by the union for the time being with the Prajna Atman, the intelligent self, the absolute. In this condition, as a manin the embrace of his darling wife does not have any consciousness of outer or inner, so the spirit embraced by the self consisting of knowledge has no con sciousness of outer and inner.1 The spirit in this condition is without desire and free from all pain ; it is unaffected by good, unaffected by evil, the father ceases to be father, the mother mother, the worlds worlds, the gods gods. There is no interruption of seeing, though the spirit sees not : we have in fact the condition of a pure objectless knowing subject, continuingin this condition. The soul now passes from the 72,000 veins in which it has moved during dream-sleep, and rests in the pericardium in supreme bliss, like a great king or Brahman, The Chandogya2 follows the same line of thought, but it lays stress on the entry of the self into the brilliance or heat, treats the soul as existing in the veins, which is possibly found also in the Brhadaranyaka, and, by a curious confusion of ideas which is already foreshadowed or perhaps rather later borrowed and interpolated in the Brhadaranyaka, the joys of free movement which belong merely to dreaming sleep are in one later passage ascribed to the deep sleep also. The Kausitaki3 makes the deep sleep the union with breath, which in its scheme is identical with the intellectual self, which is the absolute. 

In this condition of sleep without dreams it is clear that the older Upanisads find the highest bliss,4 the complete union of the individual with the absolute,5 which is all that can be attained by man. In the later Upanisads6 there appears the effort to add a fourth condition, called by its numerical designation the Caturtha or more archaically Turlya. This state is that which is attained not in deep sleep, but in the waking condition by the effort of concentration of the mind which is Yoga. The two conditions of deep sleep and the fourth differ, not in point of their failing to recognize plurality, but in the fact that the Turlya knows no slumber : the Turlya is neither deep asleep nor dreaming :

the dreamer has false knowledge, the sleeper has none. It is obviously im possible to make much of this refinement and still less of the four subdivisions of it which a later Upanisad, the Nrsifthottara,1 invents. Oltramare,2 while recognizing the possibility that even in the periodof the Upanisads there mayhave been felt the necessity of making some effort to supply an ideal whichwould not, like the established conception,find the only true reality in anentity3 deprivedof that consciousness which is in experience the mostessential and real partof existence, admits that in this conception of the Mandiikya Upanisad we have nothing more than a logical construction, evenif in ultimate analysis the phenomena of ecstasy may have given a basis for the 

conception. 

The Upanisads assume in these accounts of the states of the soul the dis tinction between the knowledge possessedin dreams and that which the soul enjoys in waking moments. But in what does this importantdistinction consist ? The answer to this problem, which is much discussed in later philosophy, cannot be supplied effectively from the Upanisads themselves, which, as has been seen, still fall short of developinga theory of the nature of sensation and perception. 

10. The Doctrine of Tt'!f*i"!'jrm->?:<>t' 

The origin of the doctrine of transmigrationis one of the most difficult problems of Indian philosophy:its extraordinarily firm hold on the mind of part at least of India, which is shown by the fact that Buddhism rests on the doctrine as an essential presupposition, makes it natural to seek the view in the earliest periodof Indian religion, and this desire to find metempsychosis in the beginnings of Indian belief takes two forms. On the one hand there have been seen direct references to metempsychosis in the Rigveda, and on the other there have been traced there ideas which explain the genesis of the con 

ception. 

The references to transmigration which have been seen in the Rigveda are all of the most improbable character : it is to ignore the nature of poetryto press the wish that there may be long life for man among the gods4 into the view that it contemplatesrebirth : the attempt to find references to it in 

two of the verses of the riddle hymn of Dirghatamas5 is bold, but not very plausible : the allusion,6 in which Vasistha is made 7 to refer to his previous 1 2.

birth, is quite impossible, and the same criticism can be appliedin every other case.1 The effort to find such views is naturally not modern merely : the commentaries on the Upanisadsthemselves seek to trace the idea, and the fact that they can adduce nothing worthy of consideration is surely con 

clusive proof that there was nothing. In the Brhadaranyaka Upaniad2 it is sought by ankara, without any good ground, and not in accord with the Upanisad, to show that Vamadeva, the reputed author of a hymn8beginning, *I was aforetime Manu, I the sun ', refers to his former births, and in another passage of that text,4 in the exposition of the doctrine of transmigration, a verse 6 celebrating the two ways of the Fathers and of the gods, on whicheverything meets which moves between father and mother, is pressed by the Upanisad itself into service, though the reference is merely to day and night. A third passage in the Aitareya Aranyaka,6 which refers to a third birth after death, beside that from the father and by initiation, makes also use of a verse7 of Vamadeva, in which lyingin the womb the speakerlearned all the births of the gods, but it is not provedor even plausible that the Upanisad itself refers to transmigration at all : the third birth may most probably have been in the next world,8 and in any case the quotation had nothing whatever to do with the subject. 

The effort to find suggestions of the origin of transmigrationin Vedic beliefs g is worthy of more consideration. The ideas that the birds are the forms of the Fathers, and that the Fathers creep about the roots of the plants, and the practice of using an insect or other animal, which alighted on a gar ment spread out with an invocation to the soul of the dead, when his bones cannot be found, to serve in place of his mortal relics, are points adduced byOldenberg 10 as suggesting the groundwork on which the Indian belief 

developed. It is not necessary to brush n these ideas lightly aside, or even to point out that the evidence for them is late, and not of value as prooffor the early Vedic religion. What is necessaryis to point out that, while the ideas thus recorded are of some value as showingthe presencein Indian religion ofthe belief of the incorporationof the souls of the dead now and then in animals or plants ofthe latter there is even a hint in the Rigveda12 itself the importance 1 Keith, Taittiflya Samhita, i. pp.cxxviii ff. of the text, moreover (itab prayann eva

of transmigrationlies precisely in the fact that the doctrine is an ethical system, and that it has, therefore, not merelya value totally distinct from the mere belief suggested by the evidence above adduced, but is thereby referred 

for its real origin to something quite other than popular belief. That it should have been so fully accepted by the peoplein course of time wasdoubtless aided by such views as that mentioned : but no such view could create metempsychosis as a system of the marked character of the Indian view. 

The Brahmanas contain on the whole no acceptanceof the doctrine of transmigration : the soul aims at the world of the Fathers as before : the merefact * that as punishment for the cursing of a Brahman, the layingof violent hands on him, or the spilling of his blood, the wrong-doer is kept a hundred, athousand years, as many years as the grains of dust moistened by his blood, from the world of the Fathers, shows that the view still prevailed that this world was the appointed placefor the holy dead even as it is in the Rigveda. Nor in the main is that world distinct from heaven to which a man naturally goes but sometimes fails to reach, confused by the smoke of the fire whichburned his body.2 The conceptionof weighing the good and evil of a man in a balance and his following whichever is the greater,3 and that of two fires which hold back the wicked from the way of the gods or of the Fathers,4 donot carry us to any definite view other than that of the Rigveda, and the con ception of men being discriminated as good or bad in the presenceof Yama5 is equally unimportant. But a new and important motive appearsin the growing fear of death even in the world to come. 

This fear seems, as we have seen, to have developed in accordance with the desire to distinguish the diverse degrees of good acquired by different modes of sacrifice ; it was obviously necessary to admit that every sacrificer wouldreceive reward by admission to the happinessof the world to come, but the Brahmans had to consider the claims of the richer of their patrons, and hadto promise them more in the world to come than the poorer, who offered andgave less. Hence we find that the need of food in the next world may beseverely limited, according to the mode of offering : it can be unnecessary for a spirit to feed oftcner than once in fourteen days, in four, six, or twelve months, or even once only in a hundred years, or even never at all. Againit is said that sacrifice to the gods produces less than offering to the self.6 Naciketas begs that he may be granted the privilege that his good deeds shall not decay,7 while it is said that day and night wear out the good deeds in the

next world of one who does not know a certain rite.1 The fear thus forms itself that in place of the desired immortality in the next world there will berenewed death, and many rites2 are said to save from it, the Agnihotra, the Visuvant, the Naciketas fire, the piling of the fire, the study of the Veda.There can be no doubt that the repeated death is in the next world, not in this : it is applied to the Fathers,3 and from those who are born after deathto immortality are distinguished those who are born to die again.4 The idea of the death as being a birth in the next world is not at all rare, as in the passage of the Aitareya Upanisad above mentioned, and the conceptionthat death might there be repeated is a very natural one. It remained only to transfer it to the present world and the effect of transmigration was reached. But though this stepis taken in the Upanisads it is by no means universally to be found there : there is no clear reference in the Aitareya Aranyaka or Upanisad, and the Brhadaranyaka6 has passages which quite clearly do not recognize it at all. 

The earliest notice of the doctrine of transmigration preservedfor us, apart from a few very dubious allusions in the atapatha Brahmana,6 is to betraced in the Brhadaranyaka Upanisad in the section ascribed to Yajnavalkya.It is founded in an idea which is plainly expressed but merely as an incidental view in the Rigveda7 that at death the eye of man goes to the sun, the breath to the wind, the speechto the fire, and the members are also dispersed. This conception which has no importance for the Rigveda is developedin the Qatapatha Brahmana 8 in one of the passages which approach the Upanisadcharacter, and in the Brhadaranyaka,9 after a long enumeration of the modesof disposal of the parts of man in this way, it is asked where the man thenremains. On this Yajfiavalkya takes the questioner Artabhaga apart andconfers with him in secret, and what they conversed about was work, and whatthey commended that was work. In truth, it is added, a man becomes goodby good works, evil by evil. In a subsequent passage10 the matter is further explained by the doctrine that on death, like a caterpillar or grass leech proceeding from one leaf to another, the soul, having shaken off the body andfreed itself from ignorance, presumably empirical life, makes a beginning onanother body. As a goldsmith chisels out a newer and fairer form from apiece of carving, so the soul fashions for itself another newer, fairer form, whether it be of the Fathers, or the Gandharvas, or the gods, or Prajapati, or Brahman, or other living beings ;ujust as man acts, just as he behaves, so will

he be born. He who does good will be born good, he who does evil will be born evil : he becomes holy by holy deeds, evil by evil. Hence is explained the view that man is composedof desire, in proportionto desire is his will, in proportion to his will he performs acts, and accordingto his acts does it happento him. Or, as an appended verse has it, havingattained the end of his deeds committed on earth, he returns from yonder world to the world of work. 

That this doctrine does not teach the transmigration from one body to another is asserted by Schrader,1 but this view can only be taken as a tour de force, even apart from the appended verse, which expressly makes the trans migration clear. It is also certain that, apart from the verse which is doubtful in sense,2 it is a simple transmigration by reason of character or action. It is a change of the souls from one body into another, and the instances cited are better bodies, as they are of better results from good action in the presentlife : the other beings who are mentioned are, therefore, to be understood of higher beings, in all likelihood, than man. It is only in the later Madhyandinarecension of this passagethat the form of a man is inserted. Yaj navalkya, then, considered that transmigration was the fate of men, who had not the know ledge of the identity of the individual and the absolute, which ended the possibility of transmigrationof any kind : exactly what sort of fate awaited the bad, he does not say, but clearly they would take on at best the forms of beings inferior to themselves, perhaps men of lower degree, animals, &c. 

The appended verse is interpreted by ankara to refer to the fact that the soul is not merely rewarded by beingtransferred to another body, but before Rigveda, which is an entity precedingits fruit (of. Keith, Karma-Mlmfimsfi, its master to heaven; cf. Naoiketas's pp. 36, 73 IT., 89). This theory was store of good deeds. Geldner (see naturally enough evoked by the fact Lindenau, ZII. L 49 n.) sees in AV. x. that the sacrifice often did not reap 7. 11 a reference to the persistence of any immediate fruit, and it was, therc Tapas, which is an element of Karman, fore, necessary to provide something to but the passage is very obscure. preserve continuity.

that period undergoes reward or punishment for its deeds in the appropriate place. The question of its precise meaning is not important : it may meanx merely that he transmigrates after completing one life. But the important fact is that, with the doctrine of action as determiningthe future life of man, there comes to be combined the doctrine of reward in heaven or punishment elsewhere, which is already seen in the Rigveda and more clearly in the Atharvaveda, and which we need not doubt was a popular belief, and this combination is already found in the two main texts which are our sources for the transmigrationdoctrine. Of these the Brhadaranyaka2 version is found in the sixth book which occurs in the appendix, and this fact alone indicates its later date. The other version is in the Chandogya,3 and here as always that Upanisad shows its dependencein the case of common material on the Brhadaranyaka. A somewhat corruptversion is also given in the second Pari^ista of the Nirukta. 

The account is divided naturally into two parts. The first is the theory (jfthe five fires, which is an account apparentlyof the mode in which the soul on death passes immediately, without intermediate reward or punishment, into the new body. The burning of the body on death is here taken by a newturn of thought as the offering of sacrifice, and the essential partofthe offering, the action of man, is figured as the waters, which are offered with faith ; hence the faith takes the place of the waters as the expressionfor the part whichtransmigrates. The faith, which thus ascends in the form of the sacrificial vapour to the gods,is by them offered in the heaven, the atmosphere,the earth, the man, and the woman as sacrificial fires, changing thus first to the Soma, then to rain, then to food, then to seed,4 and then to the embryo, andthen receiving existence afresh. The mythical character of the whole is obvious, and reminds us that the new doctrine of action as determining the future life was decidedly disadvantageousto the sacrificial priest, and that it was natural to reserve it as a holy mystery. 

The second part of the account deals with the two ways, that of the gods and of the Fathers, and it teaches the doctrine first of punishmentin the next world, and then rebirth on earth for those persons who were not to receive full enlightenment. The Devayana, originallyin the Rigveda the path bywhich the sacrifice of a man was borne to the godsor by which they came for it, and by which on death he joined the Fathers and the godsin heaven, is trans formed into the path by which the soul goesto the godsor to the absolute. On the burning of the body the soul enters the flame, then the day, the bright half of the month, the bright half of the year, the year, the sun, the moon(in the Chandogya version), the lightning, and finally, led by a spiritual man or,

as the Chandogya has it, a superhuman man, into the world of Brahman. Theterms are of course to be understood spatially, but in later India they wereinterpreted as temporal, and thus in the great epic the death of Bhisma is delayed by that warrior so that he may die in the Uttarayana, the northern course of the sun.1 In the case of the Pitryana the course is different : the moon is common to both since the moon was often regarded as the home of the dead,2 and in the Upanisads its waxing and waning were brought into con nexion with the movements of the souls : hence the path is the smoke, the night, the dark half of the month, the dark half of the year, the world of the Fathers in lieu of the year, the ether not the sun, the moon, which is now not a stage of transit to the world of Brahman, but the highest place attained bythe souls. The arrival of the souls fills up the moon,3 so that in the meta phorical language of the Upanisads they are enjoyed by the gods, a viewwhich the Vedanta reduces to the principle that the souls and the gods together delight therein. This time of felicity ends only when the merit of the soul is finished, and then it returns to earth by the process,in its last stages very difficult, of being materialized into ether, wind, smoke, mist, cloud, rain, plants, food, seed, and entrance into the womb of the mother to be followed byrebirth. The way of the Fathers is the lot of those who are bent on sacrifice, works of piety, and asceticism (in the Chandogya, sacrifice, gifts, and alms giving), while that of the gods which leads to the Brahman is allotted to the wise who know the doctrine and those who in the forest worship faith (in the Chandogya, worship faith and asceticism, unless it means'worship, holding that faith is asceticism '). The lot of the wicked appears to have been the third place which led to birth again as animals, of the lower insect orders, worms, or flies. In the Chandogya Upanisad4 the positionis differentiated by the division of the classes of souls, which go to the moon, into those of good andthose of abominable conduct : the former are reborn as Ksatriyas, Brahmans,or Vai9yas, the latter as dogs, pigs, or Cancjalas, but the absurdity is retained that the third class remains, described as beings which ever return. 

The Kausitaki Upanisad5presents an accommodation version : here the souls are all sent to the moon : their knowledge is there tested, and according to the result they proceed by the Devayana leading through the worlds of Agni, Vayu, Varuna, Indra, and Prajapatito that of Brahman, or they return

to earth in rebirth as a worm or a fly or a fish or a bird or a lion or a boaror a serpent or a tiger or a man or as something else. The later Upanisadsadd nothing of value to this doctrine : the Katha *refers to the rebirth of men as men or plants according to their deeds and knowledge, and the Pragna2 follows the Chandogya with some deviation. It, with the Jaiminlya Upanisad Brahmana,3 recognizes two ways from the start, one by the north course to tke world of Aditya, the other by the south course to the moon,from the former there being no return. The mention of Aditya here is anarchaic touch in comparison with the world of Brahman, while on the other hand it is more recent than the conception of the goal as the world of Yama, as in the Rigvcda. The Jaiminlya version contains the curious assertion4 that a man can, after attaining the world of Brahman through the earth, Agni, Vayu, the atmosphere, the quarters, day and night, the half months, the months, the seasons, the year, the heavenly Gandharvas, the Apsarases, the sky, the gods, the sun, the moon, each of which is the world of Brahman,5 choose at will birth in a Brahman or a Ksatriya family, a clear proof of a doctrine independent of Karman, and a curious parallel to the Buddhistdoctrine found also in Jainism of the choice of family made by the Buddhawhile in the Tusita heaven.6 In the Bhagavadgita7 we find the process carried one degree further and above the world of Brahman, from which once noreturn was possible,is set that of Krsna as all-god. The Mundaka 8 makesthe soul attain release by passing through the sun ; Hertel's view9 that release is attained after life in the Brahmaloka seems erroneous ; attain ment of the Brahmaloka is release. 

In keeping with the curious vagueness of the Upanisads is the failure to make it clear precisely what is the ground which secures for a man unionwith the absolute in lieu of rebirth. In the Chandogya10 the matter is fairly simple ; the boon falls to those who know the doctrine of the five fires and the offerings in them which explain man's descent to earth after his death, andto those who practice worshipin the forest, holding that faith is their asceti cism ; at least this is the more natural sense of the terms employed. Returnto earth is attributed to those who in the village worship, holding that their sacrifices and their gifts to the priests are their tribute. In the Brhadaran yaka,u on the other hand, the distinction is between those who practise faith

and truth, and those who devote themselves to sacrifice, alms, and asceticism. In the Muncjaka Upanisadx the attainment of the absolute is the reward of those who wise, calm, of holy conduct, practisefaith and asceticism, which is doubtless intended to be a reproductionof the view of the Chandogya, though its accuracy is dubious. In the Pra?na2 the sun and the absolute are assured to those who give themselves up to holy conduct (brahmacarya), asceticism, faith, and knowledge,while rebirth is attained by those who hold that sacri fice and gifts are their action. It may fairly be held that the earlier sources donot accept asceticism as any essential partof the equipmentfor attaining the absolute, while it is assumed as necessaryin the later texts.3 

The nature of the being which passes through transmigrationis not specially discussed in the accounts of the paths. The curious mention of the man,variously described as spiritual (mdnasa)or as superhuman (amanava), wholeads the migratingsoul from the lightning to the world of Brahman, is trans formed by the account of the Nirukta4 into a change effected in the soul itself, which becomes a spiritual essence, and with this conception Windisch5 compares the fact that the Buddha emergesin spiritual (manomaya)formfrom his mother's womb, thus avoiding all injuryto her, and the gods assumesuch a form. No certainty, however, is possible, and Deussen6 is equally certain that the mdnasa of the Brhadaranyaka version is merely a corruption of the amdnava of the Chandogya text. 

The nature of the soul which is fated, unlike this class of soul, to return to earth, is not here specifically described in any way, but in another partof the Brhadaranyaka Upanisad7 we find the description of the fate of the soul on death, from which it appearsthat all the organs accompanythe departing Atman, that it enters into the Samjftana, and so becomes possessedof know 

ledge and consciousness, Vijfiana, while, it is added, its learning and actions hold fast to it, and its knowledge of what has been before. With this accords well enough the Buddhist view of the migrating substance which is composedof Vij iiana, and the other four Skandhas of Vedana, 'feeling', Samjfta, 4perception ', Rupa,'corporeal form ', and Samskaras,'dispositions ', andwhich also bears the compendious term of Namarupa,'name and form', the former being essentially a brief designationof the four Skandhas other thanform. Here, however, and in the orthodox doctrine of ankara and the Samkhya,8 we have express recognition of a factor which is not mentionedexpressly at any rate in the Brhadaranyaka, that of corporeal form. It is

evident that this view was not absolutely necessary for the theory of the Atman, and its development went, we may assume, hand in hand with the development of the principle of the fine elements of matter, such fine elements being obviously necessaryif they were to be conceived as accompanying an

invisible entity like a transmigrating soul. We find, however, in the sameUpanisad 1 in the dialogue between Yajnavalkya and Artabhaga, which is preserved in one tantalizing fragment, that in the case of death a man'sspeech departs to the fire, his breath to the wind, his eye to the sun, his mindto the moon, his ear to the pole, his body to the earth, his Atman to the ether, his hair to the plants and trees, his blood and seed to the waters, but there remains to transmigrate his Karman alone.2 It is true that ankara proves equal to the occasion and disposes of the mention of the disappearance of the Atman by interpreting the ether as the space in the heart wherein dwells the self, but this explanationis a mere tour de force. On the other hand, Windisch 3suggests that the necessary element of personality must be deemedto be given by the persistence of the name, which in the preceding section of the Upanisad Yajnavalkya has declared to be the one thing which persists onthe death of man, and this interpretation appearsto be necessarily correct, while it suggests the origin of the use of the term'name'in the Buddhistconception of Namarupa as the factor which passes through transmigration. Jacobi,4again, suggests that the force of Karman produces a new complex of the elements, holding that the idea of a permanent soul was not yet known,but this is a far-fetched conception. In the vagueness of conception we havenothing to wonder at : the whole conceptionis seriously regarded so bizarre, that it is not surprising that to clothe it in definite language was beyond the power of the authors of the Upanisads. 

In the later literature6 there exist, despite the prevalence of the Karmandoctrine, none the less the inconsistent ideas that on the one hand the sin of the father passes over to the child, apart from the action of the child in former births, and on the other that the saving graceof the Lord avails to break the chain of Karman. Still more naturally in the period of the Upanisads, whenthe doctrine of Karman was far from being a fixed dogma, it is not surprising that many traces of conceptionsinconsistent with the Karman belief should appear. Of these the most obvious is the belief in the power of the Atman byspecial grace to manifest itself, which is found in the Katha, the Mun<Jaka, and still more clearly in the veta$vatara Upanisad, but equally important is the doctrine that in the son the father is continued in being in such a mannerthat the son takes over all that his father has, includinghis Karman,6 though

580 The Philosophy ofthe Veda [Part V  

the term in the context applies generally to all action and has no moral reference, and that for any evil done by his father the son makes atonement,1 a view which results in the constant insistence on begetting offspring as a religious duty,2 and which in the later period takes the more crude and vulgar form that the mere birth of a son (putra) saves the father from the hell namedPut, a puerile verbal playin the precise manner of the Upanisads. This idea must clearly be reckoned along with those passages which declare that in the son the father is born again, an idea which is in itself not strictly reconcilable with the view that the soul transmigrates on death, since in the elaborate description of the Fpanisadsthe tradition from father to son is of so complete a kind that it would seem that there was nothing more which could transmi grate : we have in fact three diverse ideas more or less blended, the birth of the father in the productionof a son, the handing over by the father ondeath to the son of his whole personality, and the migration of the father's soul into some new existence. 

A further breach with the theoryof Karmaii is to be seen in the case of the Kausitaki Upanisad,3 which tells how the man who attains the Brahmanafter passing by the river of immortality casts away his good and his evil deeds, which his friends and enemies duly share, while he from his lofty position gazes calmly at good and evil deeds, and the contrasts of night and day. This idea, as Hopkins4 has shown, has a ritual origin: in the atapatha Brahmana5 we are told how the man who performs the Agnihotra after sunset and before sunrise escapes the fate which normally awaits men in the world to come, where the days and the nights gradually destroytheir good deeds, and doomthem in due course to that renewal of death which the Brahman regardsas the worst of unhappinesses. Thus earlyit is clear the Karman doctrine had to face the competitionof conflicting and doubtless older views, which never could be brought into real coincidence with it. 

Another of the many contradictions involved in the theory arises fromthe view that on the departureof the soul on death it is accompanied by its recognition of the past, that is, that it retains a real personality. The difficulty of disposing of the fact that in practice the soul has no such recollection in its new birth of this previous experienceis met by the statement that the child in the womb in its ninth month of existence possessesthis knowledge, but through the pangs of birth is deprivedof it.6 The Buddhist view admits that the Buddha enters with complete memory and intelligence into the womb,7 but in his case his miraculous birth preventsthe loss of his supreme powers. 

The later literature, by no means in harmony with the principles of Karman, assumes that great importanceattaches to the thought which is in

the mind of man in the moment of death,1 and we find a faint premonition of this view in the insistence laid in the Prana Upanisad2 that man's thought determines his next life. Possibly a similar conception may underlie the prayer put by the I^a Upanisad3 in the mouth of the dying man. 

11. The Way of Salvation 

In the view of the Buddhist the world is misery, and the whole end of manis to remove the misery of existence from himself by the destruction of that desire, which leads ever from birth to birth. But the wholesale pessimism of the Buddhist is by no means characteristic of the Upanisads: to find real pessimism in them, as apart from mild expressions of the unsatisfactoriness of the finite compared with the infinite, is impossible.It is also impossible, therefore, to trace to the empirical despairof the world the growth of pessi mism ; the most that in this regard can be said is that the tendencyto take a pessimistic view of life may have been favoured among the upper classes of the Indians by the effect of the climate4 and admixture with the aborigines, which was steadily taking place and was weakening the mental character of the race. Of the latter fact there can be no doubt : the geniusof the Upanisadsis different from that of the Rigvcda, however many ties may connect the twoperiods. The emancipationtheories of the Upanisads must, therefore, betraced to some more intellectual ground. 

In the Rigveda and in the Brahmanas the ideal aimed at is lengthof days on earth and life in the world of heaven in companionshipwith the gods. In the Brahmanas we find that the reward of community of being, companion ship, and fellowship with the gods is promisedto the performersof various rites, in the case of diverse gods, Agni most of all, but also Vayu, Indra, Varuna, Aditya, Brhaspati, Prajapati, and finally even with the impersonal Brahman.5 The gods are then reduced to the position of being no more than means by which entryto the Brahman can be obtained, and even Agni is placed in this positionas well as Indra and Prajapati. When the Brahmanis also regarded as the Atman, the end becomes unity with the Atman, andthis was the saving mode of emancipation,before transmigration was believed in. The knower of the wise long-emancipated youthful Atman ceases to fear death ;6 the finder of the Atman ceases to be stained by action ;7 knowledgeleads to the place where desire is at rest, where no sacrificial gift reaches, nor

582 The Philosophy ofthe Veda [Part V  

the penance of the ignorant.1 It is clear that what is contemplated is attain ing by knowledge union with the Brahman, but the influence of the traditional view is seen in the fact that it is still regardedas the arrival at a world of heaven as if the Atman were without the self.2 The same conflict appearsin the view that the Atman is the infinitely great and the infinitely small, and that on the departureof the soul, it is to go to the Atman, and enter in. In all these passagesit is necessary to recognize that the knowledge of the Atman leads only to unity with the Atman after death, and that the unity is conceived on the old model of community with a deity. 

A further and important stepis undoubtedly taken with the recognition of the fact that the emancipation desired is already achieved in this life bymeans of the recognitionof the fact of the unity of the self and the absolute.8 He who knows *I am the Brahman' becomes the universe : even the gods haveno power to prevent him so becoming, for he is its soul.4Or, in the words of the Muncjlaka Upanisad,5 c He who knows the supreme Brahman becomesthe Brahman.' The mere knowledge constitutes the deliverance : the manceases to be affected by any desires of any kind : his deeds good or bad cease to have any effect on him :8 like the reed stalk in the fire, his works consumethemselves away :7 as water does not stay on the lotus leaf, further works donot cling to him.8 The discussions of Yajiiavalkya with the king, Janaka,9 reveal the truth that the absence of desire, the disappearance of every passion,10 is the mark of the man becoming immortal and attaining to the Brahman.Similarly, in veiled language he informs the king that death will not produceany essential change in the self, and he denies in his discussion with Maitreyi that there is any consciousness after death.11 Though later interpreted materialistically by the Carvakas, the sense is clearly otherwise. After deaththe indestructible self ceases to have that division of consciousness as subject and object, which gives the empirical consciousness of the world. The wise know that there is in the universe as we have it no reality, nor is there anyfurther reality in immortality, if understood as a prolonged individual exis tence after death. 

The attainment of emancipation bythis knowledge which gives it, and is it, results in the immediate cessation of every emotion : how can man desire any

thing who knows himself to be all ? How can he fear when there is no other? There can be no sorrow for him nor pain : he is like a blind man who has gained his sight, a wounded man healed, a sick man made whole. All his 

works are annihilated, as they have meaning only for an individuality. Futureworks have no effect upon him, but evil he cannot wish to do, since he has nodesires :* he may, if he cares, live on for the full lengthof life or do anyaction so long as he does it disinterestedly, a view which the t?a Upanisadoffers, despite its paradoxical appearance, doubtless as a sopto those who did not wish to be denied the position of emancipation, but preferredalso to enjoy the things of life. He cannot again ever feel any doubt ;2 he has the full and abiding knowledge for all time. 

The view that the emancipation is attained in the moment of the know ledge is, however, very far from being universally expressed or believed. Theidea on the contrary occurs, ever and again, that the result of the enlighten ment is only completeat the end of the life of the self, and that the enlighten ment takes the form of an alteration in spaceto a new abode.8 These ideas arc, of course, merely the ideas regarding the fate of the soul, transferred to the new conception of the gainingof knowledge. The view that the attainment of knowledge brought release was one, which, we may safely assume, was noteasy to grasp or to hold, for the very good reason that it is as a matter of fact unintelligible. Hence the Upanisads as a rule merely consider that the advantages of the acquisition of knowledge are the winning of the desired immortality : the view of the merger of the Atman in the Atman as a mererecognition of identityis not the conception usually found, which is rather that the reward is eternity. Thus in the Katha Upanisad, in which has beenseen the doctrine of final release by Deussen, there is no trace, as Whitney4 has clearly pointed out, of anything more than the mere recognition of the winning of immortality as the result of knowledge, in this case philosophical knowledge, not as in the Taittiriya Brahmana,6 from which the conception of the Upanisad is borrowed, ritual knowledge. So we have many other accounts, all of the same kind : the soul is supposed to go out by the veins to the rays of the sun and to the sun ;6 in the accounts in the transmigration doctrine 7 the souls even of the men who have acquired knowledge are conceived as going by a long journey to the world of Brahman and the sameidea is repeated in the variant versions of the Kausltaki Upanisad8 wherefrom the moon such souls go by the worlds of fire, wind, Varuna, Indra, Prajapati and then reach Brahman. In the Aitareya Aranyaka9 we learn

that Vamadeva, as a result of knowing the Atman, ascended from this world, and attained immortality in yonder world of heaven. The Kausitaki also has an account in detail of the world of Brahman, with the Aparajita palace, which is derived from Varuna's Rigvedic abode, the tree Ilya, the Salajya 

city, and the sea Ara, the later conception being perhapsderived from the seas, Ara and Nya, in the world of Brahman invented by the Chandogya Upanisad.1 Yet another version makes the emancipated man be separated from the non emancipated by the fact that at death his soul goes out by the 101st vein,2 whence he proceeds by the crown of the head, fire, wind, and sun up to Brah man. All these are proofsof the perfectly simple meaning givento saving knowledge by the Upanisads generally. The knowledge might really confer the enlightenment in the view of a few minds, but the overwhelming opinion3 of the age was that the reward was the heaven in one form or another.4 Thelater Vedanta endeavoured to bring order into these ideas, and reconcile themwith the real nature of emancipation by the theory of the contrast betweenthe Jivanmukta, who obtains release in perfection only on death, but who is really released in life by his attainment of knowledge, and the subject of the progressive emancipation, Kramamukti, by which the passageto the world of Brahman took placebefore the final release by the attainment of complete insight, but these devices remain as unnatural as possible.5 

12. The Ethics ofthe Upanisads and Yoga In comparison with the intellectual activity of the Brahmans the ethical content of the Upanisads must be said to be negligible and valueless.6 Thetotal impression conveyed by the Upanisadsis that of an intellectual exercise, whose aim was the attainment partly of immediate goods, partlyof the highest good, normally the happinessof heaven which was often materially enough conceived, and there is made no attempt to make the theoretical philosophy a ground of morality of any sort. There are, here and there, moral maxims enunciated, but these are of no consequence and rise in no wayabove popular morality. On the contrary, the essential fact is expressed byIndra in his dialogue with Pratardana :7 the possessionof knowledge makesa man independentof all morality, the slayingof an embryo, the murder of a

father or of a mother. It is, of course, true that these statements are not meant seriously, and that we may console ourselves by supposingthat the priest did not hold that these crimes could really be disposedof in this way, though of that we cannot be certain as the same results can be attained by

ritual practices. But they must have felt an exaggerated value to attach to their speculations, and have completely failed to see that moralityis the mostobjective and essential part of philosophy, and is something other thansacrificial activity or intellectual gymnastics. 

Here and there we have views which are sound so far as they go ; the allegory of life x as a Soma sacrifice postulates that the fee shall be asceticism, liberality, right dealing, non-injury to life, and truthfiilness, and a list of a student's duties is given in the Taittirlya Upanisad.2 The student is bidden by his teacher not to be negligentof truth, virtue, welfare, prosperity, study and teaching, and in due course propagation of children. Further, duties to the gods, the Fathers, and parentsare inculcated, and teachers and guests are to be ranked as gods. Those acts which are irreproachable alone should be practised, and good deeds alone should be revered. Refreshments with a seat should be provided for deserving Brahmans. Giving is regulated ;3 one should give with faith, one should not give without faith, one should give with plenty, with modesty, with fear,4 with sympathy. Further, a very useful practical rule is enjoined ; if the student has doubt concerning an act or conduct, then recourse should be had to the attitude of Brahmans, competentto judge, apt, devoted, not harsh, lovers of virtue ; as they behave themselves in such a case, so should the student demean himself, and similarly should heact in regard to persons who are spoken against. There is thus given as the norm of conduct the average righteous man, who embodies in himself the standard of action. In the same Upanisad5 in addition to the essential study and teaching a further list is given which runs : right dealing, truthfulness, asceticism, self-restraint, tranquility, maintenance of the sacred fire, the offering of the Agnihotra, hospitality, courtesy, and duties to children, wives, and grandchildren. Another text sees in the voice of the thunder the rules * Be restrained, liberal, merciful '.6 So we have condemned as sinners the stealer of gold, the drinker of Sura, the murderer of a Brahman, and the defiler of his teacher's bed, and their associates,7 while Avapati, the prince, boasts that his kingdom has no thief, churl, or drunkard, none who neglect the sacrifice or the sacred lore, no adulterer or courtesan.8 This is, it is clear, purely elementary : the failure to rise to the conception even of a system of ethics is a sign not so much, as Deussen9suggests, of the virtue of the age,

which is not proved by any other evidence, but rather of the lack of ethical sense on the part of the Brahmans. Philosophicallyalso the doctrine of the absolute as all-pervadingresulted in the negationof human responsibility: it is the deity who really acts in and through man, and the latter cannot be blamedfor what he thus seemingly does.1 

In truth the aims of the Brahmans were bent on things which are not ethical at all, immediate profit on the one hand, or, on the othei, the closer realization of the absolute in which they believed, and which they desired to appreciate in full enjoyment. The ideal is embodied in the most curious forms. Knowledge in the Upanisadsis essentially profitable,2 and by nomeans for spiritual ends alone. He who knows the world as fivefold obtains it ; he who knows Indra as without a rival has no rival ; the possessor of knowledge cannot be injured by an enemy ; neither the northern nor the southern mountains can prevail against him, and his foes die around him, anidea found in the Aitareya Brahmana.3 It is an easy step to the result already seen ; knowledge obliterates evil ; one who knows may consort with even the murderer without being contaminated.* With a strange contrast to Sokrates who held that the wise man would necessarily be good, we arc repeatedly assured that knowledge relieves man from worryingas to whether he has done wrong or rightin any matter.6Entry into the absolute is accompaniedby the casting aside of good and evil deeds, which arc transferred on one viewto one's relatives or foes respectively.6 With an anticipation of modernidealism, and in the true spirit of mysticism, good and bad may be regarded as imperfect conceptsfor which there is no proper placein the absolute ; if speech were not, neither right nor wrong, true nor false, good nor bad, pleasant nor unpleasant, could be known.7 The absolute self is unsullied byevil to which he is external ; an etymology provesit;for he is called the person, Purusa, since he burned (?^) up evil before (purva)all these worlds.8 In uniting with him the individual parts utterly from good or bad.9 We see this even in sleep, for in it neither evil nor good attaches itself effectively to the 

self.10 WT hen we are told u that the world is truth, there is no ethical implication, for it is plain that there is here merely an assertion of the reality of the universe, the word Satya conveying both senses, and in the theistic veta$vatara12 the description of the lord as the bringerof right and the remover of evil is due to the confusion, there constant, between the personal deity and the absolute. The emancipated self possesses autonomy, but it is not an ethical

state ;x it is merely a condition of unhindered power, the ideal of a despot, the state of the manwho goes up and down these worlds, eating what he desires, assuming what form he desires.2 

Prajapati utterly condemns3 the doctrine, derived allegedly from his teaching by the demon Virocana, which asserts that the man who consults his own desires in this life obtains both this world and the world to come ; this view is described as devilish, naturally enough since it would have turned all 

against gifts to the priests or sacrifice. But we have instead the clear doctrine4 that the self is dearer even than a son, and that whatever is dear, be it wife, sons, wealth, the Brahman class, the Ksatriya class, the gods, worlds, any thing, is dear not for itself, but for the sake of the self or soul. We have here, not the psychological theory that thingsare desired for their pleasure, not for themselves, nor the suggestion that all love is ultimately self-love, but the recognition of the fact of the unity of the whole, whichfinds its truth in the self. Plainly, however, there is no attempt to develop a positive morality5 whichwould render empiric selfishness wrong on the score that it was based on a false distinction between self and not-self. On the contrary we find only emphasized throughout the necessity of caring for one's own salvation ; Yajiiavalkya abandons his faithful wives to seek the welfare of his soul, just as the Buddha abandons his young bride and his child, because they are hin drances to the attainment of release. 

The true ideal, therefore, of the seeker for truth is embodied in the practice of asceticism and the adoption of renunciation : by turning away fromthe things of this world, and by concentrating unnaturally the mind on the object, the vision beatific was to be obtained : the utter incompatibility of this with the purely intellectual view, that the recognition of the Brahman as the self was emancipation,is obvious, but contradictions in adjecto are the normal characteristic of the Upanisads. Hence was developed the scheme bywhich the old rule of life was complicated and a series of four Asramas,*places of asceticism ', was devised, through which the man should pass on his way to his home in the heaven. 

In the earliest Upanisads we find only the conception that, beside the life of the student and the householder, men might give themselves up to ascetic practices in their seeking for the truth. There was no idea that the stages of life should be successive, ending with the ascetic stage: the ascetic stage might follow the stage of household life if desired, but equallyit might not.6 But in the later Upanisads, such as the Jabala7,we find the four stages ordered

as student, householder, anchorite, Vanaprastha, and finally wandering beggar, Parivrajaka, Bhiksu. The first two stages remain much as in the Brahmanaperiod : it is of interest that we hear of cases, where a pupil seems to have beenused by his alleged teacher mainly for the purposeof tending his cattle, in return for which the teaching might be long delayed,as in the case of Satya kama.1 Other pupils again were deemed unworthy of the teaching they desired : Upakosala2 tended the fires for twelve years without his teacher making up his mind to trust him with the sacred knowledge. The householder may still attain the world of Brahman by attention to his duties, if he con tinues to study and brings up pious sons and pupils, subduing his organs in the self and slaying no life, save at the sacrificial ground. But another viewcondemns such personsto life in the moon, and then to return to earth again. Sacrifice, Veda study, liberality, and the productionof sons arc still the chief duties, though, as we have seen, the tendency was growing to reduce the sacrifice to symbolic acts. 

The late Vaikhanasa Dharmasutra lays down that there are four categories of householder. The first (vdrttavrtti) devotes himself to the duty of agricul ture, cattle rearingor trade. The second (<?attna) performs regularly the domestic offerings, Pakayajnas, and, after establishinghis fire, carries out each fortnight the new and full moon offerings, and every four months the four-month offerings, as well as twice a yearthe animal offering, and once the Soma offering. The third (yayclvara) performsthe rauta sacrifices, including the Soma sacrifice, for himself and also acts as priests for others, whence his name of' Wanderer'; he studies and teaches pupils ; he gives and accepts gifts ; he maintains his fire arid entertains guests. The fourth (ghordcdrika) is a man of severe observances, for he offers Istis, studies and gives gifts, practising specially rigorous abstinence in the months Margasirsa and Jyaistha, performing morning and evening the Agnihotra, and maintaining the fire with fruits of the wood. We need not supposethat this ideal scheme corre sponded to any very definite practice;it is noteworthy that it recognizes that in many cases the householder was more busied in his business than in the per formance of his domestic ritual. 

The business of teaching3 was doubtless carried on by many of the house holders, as well as by those who had passedthis stage. For the early Vedic period we have no indication of anything correspondingto the later Math, where large bodies of teachers and pupils were united in a loose form of monastic life. We seem to find nothing more than individual teachers attract ing a larger or smaller number of pupils ; the ideal seems to have been that a true student must dwell in his teacher's house (antevdsin), and this fact alone would negative largebodies. The epictradition4 seems to suggest that five was a maximum. From this simple relationship may be explained a dominantfeature of the Buddhist and later monastic system, the free right of any person

who had entered on a course of study to abandon it. The development of monastic systems which soon became common to all sects was furthered by the rise of Buddhism, though it need not be held to have been a specific Buddhist innovation, for it may easily have risen spontaneously among Buddhists Jains and Brahmans alike as the outcome of their competitionfor public favour. 

The third stage, that of the anchorite, is not distinguished by Yaj fiavalkya from that of the wanderer : when he decides to give up the life of the house holder he contemplates wandering about as a beggar.1 The value of penancefor the knowledge of the Brahman is not overestimated in the oldest Upanisads : the king Brhadratha,2 after most painful mortification, is still far fromattaining the desired knowledge. Asceticism, it is even said, leads only to the way of the Fathers, and has not the result of future emancipation. The manwho really realizes the Brahman is above the Acramas ;3 he has realized all that is aimed at by asceticism ; he has no longer individuality or family con nexion, he wanders about homeless, begging, without possessions, and bears the name Sannyasin, the rcnouncer of everything. How this ideal can be logically derived from knowledge of the Atman is nowhere explainedin the 

Upanisads. 

With the usual curious turns of Indian thought the Sannyasin, who is really a person beyond the Acramas as the vetacvatara Upanisad calls him, becomes in the later Upanisadsa man strivingfor the knowledge of the Atmanby means of asceticism. He should undertake this stage only as a rule after being a forest hermit, though he may enter into it direct from the house holder's state.4 He parts solemnly after sacrifice from all his kin, abandons all sacrifice for ever, gives up the saered cord and the tonsure, lays aside his former garments and his staff, is clad in rags and a loincloth, and wandersabout save at the periodof the rains, living on what he begs and inhabiting lonely spots : some texts even demand nudity : he bears now a triplestaff or a single staff, to signify perhaps the reconciliation of caste differences. Onlyone night may he live in a village, five in a town, but in the four months of the rains he may stay there. He is to recite Upanisads and the Aranyaka, to meditate, perform bathings, be indifferent to every human emotion, and showcharity to all creatures. He must practise Yoga, that is, exercises intended to bring the mind into mystic union with the absolute. Though the system of the later Yoga,5 which is linked to the Samkhya, and which, therefore, in theory aims really primarily at the isolation of the spirit and nature, not at union with the divinity, is not found set out in the same precise detail, most

of its elements can be traced in the Upanisads,1 and in the Katha we are dis tinctly told that it is necessary to suppress speech and mind, mergingthe latter in the knowledge self, that in the great self, and that in the calm self, the absolute. The highest stage is attained when the five senses cease to give knowledge, when the mind and the intellect are at rest ; the firm restraint of the senses is Yoga. The fveta^vatara devotes its second chapterto the praise of Yoga, prefacing it with prayers, adapted from the Taittirlya Samhita, in which the aid of Savitr is invoked to secure the application of the mind to the task set before the Yogin. He should hold erect his body, and cause his senses and mind to enter into the heart, check his movements, and breathe with diminished intensity through the nose, restraining from distraction his mind. A clean level spot, free from pebbles, fire or gravel, favourable to thought by the presence of water, not offensive to the eye, protected from the wind and secluded, is recommended. Fog, smoke, sun, fire, wind, fireflies, lightning, crystal, the moon, are given as the preliminary appearances whichpresent themselves to the Yogin ; lightness, healthiness, steadiness or freedom from desire, clearness of countenance, pleasantnessof voice, sweetness of odour, and scantiness of excretions are the first stagein his progress. Therevelation of the absolute procures freedom from fetters and sorrow ; sickness, old age, and death are overcome. The Upanisad, however, does not rely onYoga alone ; the one is attainable not by Yoga merely but by reflection (sdmkhyd) also, terms in which we need not see references to established schools, as does Oldenbcrg.2 The insistence on breathing as a matter of im portance is noteworthy ;3 restraint of breath not merely banishes evil influences, it tends to generate heat, thus producing Tapas, and by restraint serves to deaden the activity of the brain, thus favouring the feeling of severance from the world and union with the absolute. 

The Maitrayamya repeatedly develops the theme ; the state to be aimedat is reaching the fourth stage,4 by the suppression of the living self. Bypressing the tip of the tongue against the palate,6 by suppressing voice, mind,and breath, one sees the Brahman, the self, and becomes selfless. Anotherdevice, forming the beginning of an advance by sound to the absolute without sound, consists in closing the ears with the thumbs,6 when the sound of the ether within the heart becomes audible. By the suppressionof breath the light of the ether within the heart is made manifest.7 Or again by using the sound Om as an arrow, with mind as its point, the Yogin pierces the darkness and sees him who sparkles like a wheel of fire, the colour of the sun, the Brah

A formal list of six elements of Yoga appearsin the Maitrayaruya Upanisad.2 These are Pranayama, 'regulation of the breathing out and in', Pratyahara, 4suppression'of the organsof sense such as the mind, so as to preventits activity spoiling concentration, Dhyana,4meditation', Dharana, 'concentra tion of the attention ', Tarka,4 reflection ', a term of doubtful sense in this context,3 and Samadhi,'absorption'or complete union with the objectof meditation. This list differs, in the insertion of Tarka, and in the placing of Dhyana before Dharana, from the later list, which makes up the number of eight members by inserting as the first three items Yama, 'discipline', refraining from doing injury, truthfulness, &c., Niyama,'self-restraint' such as purity, contentment, &c., and Asana,'posturesin sitting'. Of all these the most importantis the use of Om as a symbolof Brahman to meditate upon. It is recognized by the Katha,4 but its importance belongsto the later Upanisads, which delightin mystery regardingit ; it has three syllables or morae, or three and a half, or three morae and three echoes, three morae andfour half morae, and so on ; the pointof the Anusvara is given a hidden sense arid the echo is also famed. It is refreshing to find that silence is called the highest point of all.5 The view then is that man can only enter on the medita tion with Om : he must at the end attain the nothingnessin that which is not a word, like the sapof the flowers in the liquid honey.6 In the condition of Samadhi the consciousness of a separate subject and object entirely disappears, and the state of selflessness is reached. This union is attained by the ascent of the soul, from the heart through the Susumna vein and the Brahmarandhra,to union with the absolute.7 Naturally this conceptionis developed with the aid of the metaphor by which the heart is called a lotus, and by the use of the veins, 72,000 in number, into wild fantasies* Yet, though most of this absurdity is found in the later Upanisads,it should be recognized that the needs of Asana are hinted at in the Qvetacvatara,8 and the virtues of Praty ahara are recognized by the Chandogya.9   

Religious suicide, which we have not seen in the Brahmana period,is mentioned in this, but only at the latest stage, longafter the periodof the Upanisads proper, when authorityis givento the beggar to abstain from food, to throw himself into the water or fire,10 to choose a hero's death. Strange folly to emerge from the comparativerationalism of the Upanisads, andto reach its apotheosisin the religion of the Jina.

592 The Philosophy of the Veda [Part v  

13. The Significance of the Philosophy of the Upanisads What judgement are we to pass on the main thought of the Upanisads? Are they really the expressionsat an early date of the deepest principles of philosophy, or are they merely of historical value, interesting pictures of the curly t1ioui>1il of man, important not per se, but because of their dominating influence on the future philosophy and life of India ? The two interpreters, who have of recent times been most impressed by the nature of that philosophy as idealism, have passed the most diametrically opposed views on the question : Gough was impressed with the necessity of explaining the defects of the subject of which he treated by the admixture of blood among the Indians, and the corrupting influences of a low order of civilization, while Deussen*is lost in admiration of the Upanisads,as was Schopenhauer before him :'Eternal philosophical truth9,he says,*has seldom found more decisive and striking expression than in the doctrine of the emancipating knowledge of the Atman.' He claims 2 that Yajftavalkya had anticipated the view of Schopenhauerregarding immortality as indestructibility without continued existence ; he regards the view of the nature of the self as an anticipation of the doctrine of Kant ; he defends the doctrine of transmigration as the best expressionof the true state of matters in the terms of empirical thought, while recognizing that such an expressionis misleading : nay, he argues that the Kantian argumentregarding immortality, based on the realization of the moral law within us, points not to ordinary immortality, but rather to the process of transmigra tion, and transmigrationhas been solemnly upheld as philosophicdoctrine at the present time by competent authorities. 

The position of Deussen is, of course, coloured by his acceptance of the view that Kant has finally3 shown that the knowledge of the ultimate reality is not possible, with which he combines the Schopenhauerian doctrine of the primacy of the will which he traces to Christianity, and his view of the Upani sads is, therefore, greatly determined by his double desire, to find in them the anticipation of Kant and to show that the views of Kant, as modified bySchopenhauer, are the only possible views of philosophy. To those who donot accept his theories the arguments adduced by him fall with the theories themselves, but the investigation of this question belongs to a general philoso phical discussion, which is hardly here necessary or appropriate. The moreimportant question which arises is to what extent the doctrines of the Upani sads do foreshadow the views of Kant.

Chap. 28] Significance of the Philosophy of the Upanisada 593  

The answer to this question must candidly admit that the conception of the Upanisads formed by Deussen as containing a definite doctrine of idealism, that of Yajfiavalkya, which is variously broken down by realistic intrusions, and accommodations to common-sense, is one which is contrary to all pro bability and reason. The ideas of Yajfiavalkya, that is of the men whoframed and attributed to his famous name those views, are the high-water mark of the speculationof the Upanisads : the rest of the material is merely the natural development of the Brahmana theories. Those theories are of historic interest : as philosophy, they are unworthy of a moment's considera tion. On the other hand the views of Yaj ftavalkya do certainly go the length of asserting the unknowableness of the subject and the fact that the Atman,the subject matter of the philosophy of the age, was the knowing subject within the man : it is further clear that he maintained that the Atman was the only real thing, and that plurality was illusory. It is quite true that even in the section attributed to him there are many expressions which will not harmonize with this conception, but it would be unfair not to take the doctrines at their face value, and to recognize that we cannot reasonably expect full consistency on these matters. It is, therefore, necessary to consider these doctrines in themselves in their value for thought. 

The essential result appearsto lie in this, that the distinction of subject andobject is realized, and that, with the recognition of this distinction, it is seen that, as such, the subject cannot possibly be an object of thought or knowledge. These propositions are perfectly true, if duly confined to what they assert : consciousness essentially involves the distinction of subject and object, andclearly it is impossible to make the subjective activity an object of knowledgein exactly the same sense as the content of that activity is an object of know ledge.1 But with this doctrine we make little progress to the understanding of the world, and the theory that it was really an anticipation of the view that the thing-in-itself is unknowable is not supported by any evidence whatever. On the contrary, the assertion of the unity of the self and the denial of plurality cannot be deduced on any legitimate manner from the doctrine so far arrived at, and these theories amount to no more than the desire to arrive at the con ception of some permanent and abiding thing. But the identity of the self and the absolute is based merely on the abstraction of the self as subjectivity, and that of the absolute as subjectivity, and the identity is therefore meaning less and a mere matter of words. 

Moreover the utter difference between Yajftavalkya and Kant appearsclearly when we realize that Yajfiavalkya, with his theory of the unity of the

absolute, has no theoryat all of the relation of the empiric world to the absolute, i. e. that he really leaves the whole question of philosophy unsolved, and that the followers of his theory were at the last forced to fall back, as 

early as the fveta^vatara Upanisad, on the mere phraseof Maya, 'illusion*, which turns the supreme lord into a conjurer.1 The Kantian doctrine, it need hardly be said, leaves us with the whole empiric world regulated underdefinite principles in time and space, and subject to causality, and it merely assures us that behind these relations we must not expect by intellectual meansto find the meaning of existence. That meaning, however, it finds in the moral consciousness, which then becomes of infinite importance. In the doctrine of Yajfiavalkya on the contrary we have nothing save denial of all real causality and multiplicity, and on the other the normal cosmogonismof the Brahmanas. Of moral principles Yaj fiavalkya's main text is entirely innocent : the pure intellectuality of his doctrine led to the consequence that the moral acts of the person who had knowledge were indifferent, a fact which no sophistry could conceal and which was recognized at an early date :2it has its precise counterpart in the view, prevalentin the Middle Ages in Europe as in India, that devotion to God or an idol was enough to wipe out any infamies. 

When we pass to the doctrine of Karman, the hopeless inconsistencies of the view of Yaj navalkya become painfully obvious : the doctrine of Karmanis now introduced as explaining the nature of man's fate in life, without regard to the other doctrine that knowledge means emancipation at once. How onthe theory of Yaj navalkya conduct could have any effect at all, or anybearing on the matter, cannot be understood, but it is really incomprehensible how Deussen can accept the view that the knowledge of the unity of the Atman produces liberation. All the effect of the philosophy of Yaj navalkya is to declare the difference of subject and object, and then to assert that the Atman is one, in which there is no difference of subject and object, and there fore no consciousness, and these views do not show any connexion with emancipation or transmigration by degree of merit of conduct. It is simply inconceivable why on the ground of such theoretic knowledge men should abandon the desire for children, should give up their property, and wander about like beggars, practising a foolish asceticism. Nor as a matter of fact can we imagine that any such conception normally entered the heads of the ascetics of the Vedic age : they doubtless deemed, as the texts indeed show, that whatthey would attain by these practices was the mystic contemplationof the

divine which mystics of every time and clime have aimed at winning.1 This fact, which is clearly proved by the evidence of the many passages in whichunion with the absolute is aimed at, and regarded as a state of abiding bliss, is not in any degree compatible with the view that what the priests and sages of the Upanisads believed in was the mere fact that there existed a thing in itself, which was for ever unknowable. From such premises no such con clusions as ere drawn by the Upanisads could possibly be derived at any time. The essence of the doctrine of the Upanisads must be looked for in some 

thing else. 

Nor indeed is there the slightest doubt as to what that belief was, apart from occasional flashes of insight which led to other conclusions. Theabsolute is conceived as an ideal, with which unity is as ardently desired, as it was desired in earlier times with the gods in heaven, and the unity with the absolute is conceived in the same mode as unity with the divine had beenconceived. The Upanisads are essentially pantheistic with a strong the^stic leaning, but the extent of that theism differs from passage to passage, and in the case of Yaj navalkya and others doubtless a still more intellectual view ofthe situation was taken, in which the chief stress was laid on the conception of the Atman as the one and only reality, free from pollution, serene, unalterable, far above empirical being, or thought of any kind. But this cool intellec tualism is not by any means the pervading doctrine of the Upanisads,2 nor indeed in the record of Yaj fiavalkya's views are we without indication that the Atman itself inspired devotion of a marked kind, as comes out plainly in his address to Maitrcyi, on deciding to abandon his goods and his wives andwander forth into the wilderness.3 For most of his contemporaries, whodevoted themselves to the study of philosophy,it may confidently be believed that they were pantheists, who were delighted with their discovery of this as the truth of the universe, and who conceived the fate of the enlightened soul as the enjoyment of bliss in the existence to come in union with the oneessence of the world. 

It is these two aspectsof the Upanisads which explain the two diverse interpretations which, as we have seen, ankara, following Gaudapada andsome Aupanisada school on the one hand, and Badarayana,4 doubtless with another Aupanisada school, on the other, placed on the Upanisads. Thepurely negative character of the universe of experienceis insisted upon by(^ankara as a result of the stress laid on the unknowability of the Atman, and1 The similarity of result between the views almost inevitable, outcome of earlier

The result of true knowledge as the attainment of union with the supreme deity is thus much more easily brought into concord with the utterances of the Upanisadsthemselves. Moreover, the sense of devotion to the absolute was thus brought into accord with metaphysical reality and at the same time opportunity given to adapt the Visnu worshipof the masses* to the esoteric side of the philosophyof the Upanisads, a task carried out by Ramanuja in his great commentaryon the Brahma Sutra.2   

From the pointof view of ethics the demerits of the systemof the Upani sads are even more glaring than from the pointof view of the intellect. It is doubtless impossible to arrive at certainty on questionsof the ultimate nature of reality, but it is an easier matter to establish some principles of moral obligation, and to bring them into harmony with a scheme of the universe which if theoretical shall none the less be at any rate plausible. The defect of the Upanisads is that they render morality in the ultimate issue valueless and meaningiess. We may reasonably assume that any complete metaphysic must seek to explainas essential ingredientsof existence, truth, goodness, andbeauty, and we may safely conclude that a system, which, like that of the Upanisads, regards beauty and goodnessas nothing but hollow mockeries, is defective and essentially unsound in its theoretic basis. 

It might indeed seem at first sight that the doctrine of Yajnavalkyawhich ascribes results to the action of Karman, wouldsupplyus with a groundfor morality, and the Buddhist systemhas indeed been praised3 as an ingenious effort to establish a rigid rule of moral order in the world and to negateselfish ness by maintainingthe doctrines that there is no real self on the one hand, andthat every action is causally determined by some previousaction on the other. Even, however, in the case of Buddhism the theory is by no means satisfactory or convincing. The conceptionof Karman serves indeed in an excellent way to defend and protect the established order of things, but it is essentially fatalistic, and fatalism is not for a normal mind a good incentive to moralprogress. If, on the one hand, the doing of an evil deed is restrained by the thought that it will be punishedin another life,4it is equallytrue that reflec tion shows that the actor has really no optionin his acts and is an absolutely predetermined person, whose former acts producehis present motives andreasonings without the possibility of intervention of any kind on his part. This fatalism haunts the Vedanta and the Samkhya no less than the Buddhistsystem and practically every modern systemof absolute idealism,6 and it is

noteworthy that in the doctrine of Ramanuja there is a real effort to find someplace for independence on the part of the individual soul, just as in Buddhismand Jainism alike free will is often tacitly assumed as existing. Again, while in the occidental systems of absolute idealism there is ever an effort to find real value for the individual by seeing in him the conscious working of the absolute which realizes itself in some degree of reality in him, in Buddhism no suchsatisfaction is possible. We are indeed sometimesl invited to see in the Buddhists of the Pali texts lovers of empirical pyschology and hedonists whobelieved that life of a certain kind, the full and perfect efflorescence of mindand character on earth, was fair and lovely beyond all non-being, beyond all after-being. Unhappily in this view we have merely the ascription to Bud dhism of ideals cherished by a modern sect, in flagrant defiance of the obvious fact that the summum bonum of the system envisaged by these writers wasprecisely non-being, for in death alone have unhealthy moral conditions completely passed away for ever from a sage. From such an end the only deduction bearing upon action must obviously be the rule of avoiding passion and emotion and action of every kind, and it is significant that the develop ment of the doctrine of active compassion in the Buddhist faith is coincident with the development of the religious aspect of that belief, which in effect overthrows entirely the old ideal and which in large measure was accomplished during foreign dominion i^ India under the stress of spreading the Buddhistgospel beyond the narrow bounds of India proper. 

In the case of the Upanisads, however, the position for morality is still less favourable than in the Buddhist system. It is quite impossibleto makeKarman the leading principle of these texts, to many of which it was clearly a sealed book. Moreover it is quite impossibleto make the Karman doctrine harmonize with the doctrine of salvation by knowledge, and this doctrine is superior to all morality. Doubtless, when restricted within the narrowcircles in which it first became recognized as the fundamental truth, the doctrine of salvation by knowledge alone was not likely to produceevil living, but the effect of a doctrine, which makes morality negligible, on less trained minds can easily be recognized, and is admirably illustrated by the effect of the doctrine of faith when divorced from works. But more directly and funda mentally the system failed wholly to provide, just as the Buddhist failed to provide, a criterion for morality,since for it also the summum bonum had nointelligible relation to moral activity of any sort. On the contrary it declared the world of reality to be a delusion or at least not true reality and to be

miserable; it encouraged the declaration of one Upanisad1 that devotion to children, wife, or parentsis a means of keeping back the self from its saving knowledge : it drove Yajftavalkya to abandon his dear wife for ever, and not, as in the more sympathetic version of the Buddha legend, subject to the 

possibility of relations of friendship at a later period. The essence of its doctrine is that of the saving of the individual soul, which must resolutely refuse to allow itself to be blinded by the ordinarydesires and sympathiesof mankind. This is a logical conclusion of the metaphysicof the system. WhenYajnavalkya 2 declares that the husband is dear to the wife not for his ownsake but for the sake of the self, and applies the same principle to the other relations of human life, to the wife, to children, to riches, to other men, to the gods, and the universe, he is doubtless concerned mainly with a metaphysical doctrine ; but not only is the selfish conclusion obvious to ordinary minds,8 but it is essentially connected with the teaching itself, for on ultimate analysis the aim of the self turns out to be the annihilation of every humandesire and activity, an ideal which renders all active philanthropy idle, andwhich has caused the chief virtues of India to take the form of resignation, passive compassion, and charity.4 

On the other hand, the attainment of the ideal of union with the absolute led to the addiction to the practise of meditation, and above all in ever in creasing measure in later times to the seekingof mystic states of absorption in the absolute. It is right to recognize that of this tendency on its worst side the Upanisads have very little to show. It is an exception when the Chan dogya Upanisad 6 solemnly assures us that the possession of saving knowledge enables a man to have at pleasure the presenceof the Fathers, the Mothers, brothers, sisters, friends, garlands, perfumes, music, and women : doubtless in some degree concession had to be made to the desires of those who, unlike Naciketas, preferred material joys and the houris of paradise6 to the know ledge of the truth of the fate of man after death. But it was inevitable that a doctrine, which regarded morality as not really existent, and preachedthe attainment of union with the absolute by means of mystic abstraction, should be productive of means of attaining the desired end which were grossly immoral : the Tantras of the later Hinduism, which in Bengal7 have ousted the Veda, which in a very real sense are the most important books of a large section of Hindus, and which are certainly by no means without occidental and American admirers, are in ultimate analysis descendants of one side of the mysticism of which a higher form appearsin the Upanisads. The sametendencies were from the first marked in Buddhism, as in the earliest texts wefind the possession of certain supernatural powers admitted as real.

doubt :I they are the products of the indigenous philosophy of India, mostinteresting expositions of early and acute efforts to grasp the nature of the universe and man's placein the cosmos, of vital importance for the under standing of Indian philosophy and religiouslife in later times, since the con ceptions which they enunciate have for the rest of Indian intellectual progress preponderant weight and influence. In comparison with the rest of Indian philosophy they excel in interest no less than in literary form and in freedomof thought : the deadly defect of the Buddhist dialogues, interminable repetition and dullness accentuated by the heaping up of synonyms or quasi synonyms, is only nascent in the Upanisads, which again are happily exemptfrom the painful duty imposed on ankara of expounding his idealism in the form of commentaries on texts which he must take as binding upon him andexpressing one consistent doctrine, in face of the fact that obviously they donothing of the sort. On the other hand, regarded as serious contributions to the solution of the fundamental problemsof philosophy, the value of the Upanisads must be considered to be comparatively small : moreover theybecame known to the western world at a time when the development of philo sophy had reached a point at which it could acquire little or nothing of great value from the Upanisads : to measure the exact effect of their influence on Schopenhauer would be extremely difficult,2especially having regard to the fact that he knew them only in a version which often completely misrepre sented their sense ; but in the long run Schopenhauer himself represents merely a back current in the course of the stream of philosophy to its un attainable goal. 

A stronger claim,3 however, has been made for the value of the doctrine of the Upanisads as a school of mysticism,'an attempt to gain personal experience of God found within the heart as a result of self-purification ', or 'as a constant process of self-purification to the intent that God may be found

within ', definitions in which as appliedto the Upanisads God must be under stood as the Brahman. It is claimed from this point of view that the Upanisads have the superiority over Christian mysticism in originality, since that depends vitally on Plotinus, while it is admitted that the mysticism of the Upanisads is too purely metaphysical, and lacks the ethical and social content of Christian mysticism. Much of Christian mysticism, however, seems defective in this regard equally with the Upanisads, thoughit may be conceded that, unlike the Upanisads, the Christian mystics

professed a faith in which essential stress was laid on morality.Christian mysticism,1 however, is undoubtedly differentiated from that of the Upanisadsby reason of the difference between the conceptionof God and that of the Brahman, even though in certain mystics the personalcharacter of the divinity tends to be merged, while in the later Upanisadsa personal deity appears in lieu of an impersonal absolute. In harmony with this distinction is the normally greater personalcharacter'of the mysticismof Chrictian seers, men and women alike. From this pointof view the Upanisads may justly be accorded greater value and importance than from that of philosophy proper, and it is significant that it is in Christian mystics that we find utterances whichthe seers of the Upanisads would have found far easier to interpret than the Kantian system, such as that of St. Catherine,'My being is God, not bysimple participation, but by a true transformation of being ', or Eckhardt's, * When the soul has lost itself and everythingin God, it finds itself again in God when it attains to the knowledge of Him, and it finds also everything which it had abandoned in God ', or his emphatic denial that God has anydefinite character of his own.2 

It is this fact of universalism that gives the mysticism of the Upanisadsin its purest form its chief appealto many minds, which find in the cult of a personal deity too narrow an outlook and too selfish a destiny for man. Tosuch spirits as these the ideal of merger in the absolute presents an effective antidote to the narrowness of traditional religion, and thus the philosophyof the Upanisads has for them the same attraction as systemsof absolute idealism have had for many typesof western mind. The chief distinction, however, between the standpointof the Upanisads in this regard and that of western theories of the absolute is that the Upanisads do not feel any serious necessity for finding a place for morality and political life, while in the west from Hegelonwards heroic, if unsuccessful, efforts have been made by the followers of this ideal 3 to establish morality and civil life as an essential element in the absolute. The contrast admits of explanation on many grounds, but one of the most obvious is the fact that the system of caste provided ready-made anethical framework which no philosopher cared to attack, while political organi zation remained almost stationary.

GREECE AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF INDIA 

IT is not to be thought that the early philosophyof Greece exercised anyinfluence on the philosophy of India. Apart from every other consideration, it is clear that the rise of philosophyin Greece was long subsequent to the beginnings of Indian philosophy in the hymns of the Rigveda, and fromthose hymns the history of that philosophy presentsitself in the light of anordered development. The same reason, which makes it inconceivable that the philosophy of the Upanisads should have been the product of external influences, such as the introduction of extraneous ideas from the warrior class, makes it inconceivable that the development of that philosophy should havebeen affected by influences from Greece. 

The only question, therefore, which can arise is whether the early schools of Greek philosophy were affected by the tenets of the schools of the Brahmans.This question, first handled with naive enthusiasm by Sir William Jones, has been dealt with at length by Garbe,1 who is quite preparedto derive early Greek philosophy in large measure from India, and the merit of his work onIndian philosophy renders it necessary to consider carefully the argumentswhich he has adduced. The possibility of such influence must be admitted, though its probabilityis a very different question.Still we cannot assert that there was any insuperable barrier between early India and early Greece : the proof of such intercourse is not largein quantity or quality, but the merefact that the two countries were not separated by uncrossed deserts or seas is so far in favour of there having been exchange of ideas. Positive evidence is sometimes allegedin the shape of the quaint legendof the wooers of Agaristc in Herodotos,2 which is traced to a Buddhist Jataka, and even for the famous passage of the Antigone,3 in which the heroine weighs the respec tive claims of brother and husband to consideration as regards the duty of self-sacrifice, an Indian original has been claimed. In neither instance is the case at all made out and the easy credulity with which the claims of the proof of the wandering of fables and folk-tales at an early date have beenaccepted4 is scarcely creditable to the historic acumen of the critics.

602 The Philosophy ofthe Veda [Part V  

A more serious attempt to prove connexions of a literary and religious nature is made by A. Gotze, who compares* the doctrine of correspondenceof macrocosm and microcosm as enunciated in the BundahiSn2 with the pseudo Hippokratean treatise vipl l/tto/wi&ov. The latter work appearsto have been knownto Plato, and therefore goes back to the fourth centuryB. c., while W. H.Roscher has endeavoured to assign the short treatise to the seventh century and to regard it as the earliest work extant of Greek science and fcosmology. The BundahiSn, of course, is late, and this particular portion cannot even for certain be attributed to the Sassanian recension. On the other hand we havein the Upanisads and even in the Brahmanas3 the idea of the parallelism of macrocosm and microcosm, so that the possibility that oriental influence lies at the basis of the Greek composition cannot be excluded. It may beconjectured also that oriental influence is to be seen in the doctrine of the pseudo-Hippokratean treatise irepl ^ww, where the breath is a groundof illness, and even in the doctrine of the humours, for Panini already knows in the fourth century B.C. of wind, bile, and phlegm as affecting health.4 But, even if we grant that there was influence in these matters, the date is late ; the doctrines suggested by Persia were, it is believed, introduced into Greece not before 480 B. c. by the Knidian school of medicine. We know in fact of three Greek physicians at the Persian court, Demokedes under Dareios I, Ktesias under Artaxerxes II, and Apollonides, whom Ktesias mentions. It must, however, be borne in mind that we have no evidence that the doctrines alleged to have influenced Greece were actually known in Persia in the fifth century B. c., and that a case can quite fairly be made out for Greek independencein these regards. 

Still less can we deduce Indian influence on Greece from the famousOrphic hymn,6 which celebrates the greatnessof Zeus, and was in some formor other known to Plato,6Aischylos,7 and Xcnophanes.8 The parallelism which has been seen between the cosmic doctrine of this hymn and that of the Purusasukta 9 is interesting, but it is no't claimed10 that it is due to borrowingfrom India. Rather it is suggested that the Orphic movement owed much to Iranian religious conceptions of the people, which playlittle partin the reformed religion of Zoroaster. Nor need we doubt Iranian influence on this comparatively late movement. But, so far as ascertained facts go, the evidence of any intellectual11 connexion of a serious character between

Greece and India in the period before the extension of the empire of Persia to the north-west of India is still to seek. 

The actual proof of influence must, therefore, be derived from internal evidence, the comparison of the two systems. Garbe lays stress on the fact that Xenophanes teaches that the universe is one (els 0os lv re Otourt, KO! dv0pawron /xeywrros), eternal and without change, and that Parmenideswrites in verse, and holds that realityis due alone to this universal being, neither created nor to be destroyed, and omnipresent, that everything whichis subject to change is unreal, and that thinking and being are identical.1 Headmits that the identity of thinking and being, and the insistence on the unreality of the universe, can be proved as a definite doctrine in India only from texts later than Parmenides ; but he insists that the doctrines are implicit in the Upanisads, and that they, therefore, may justly be deemed to have been the sources of the Eleatic philosophy.It might be added that the two philosophies are alike in the fact that they both realize that the nature of the absolute must be deemed in some way to be intellectual, however little either is able to make the nature of that intellectual character intelligible. 

When these resemblances are pointed out, however, all that can be said for the theory is said : there is no ground to assume borrowing : the clearness of the position of Parmenides regarding the nature of the one is much morepronounced than the view of the Upanisads, and the identification of thoughtand the object is carried beyond the views of the Upanisads,while by his view of truth and opinionas distinct Parmenides anticipates Indian thought. It is, therefore, far more probablethat the Greek and the Indian views were of independent origin: the Greek bears already the mark of definiteness whichis only evolved centuries later in the Indian thought, and it is also aided by its freedom from the mythological connexions, which weigh so heavily on the thought of the Upanisads. The fact that the Brahman is identified with thoughtis by no means the same thing as the idea that thought and its object are identical, a doctrine of Parmenides2 which duly modified is brought to its most complete form in the theory of Aristotle.3 Nor is it of any value to cite the fact that Thales's view of the originin water of everything is much later than the Vedic conception of the waters as the primeval form of existence. The idea is not only Babylonian but is a singularly simple one, as found in primitive religion, and must have been natural to primitive man : it is even possible to trace in theory the mode in which he arrived at this result. Similarly it is idle to compare the primitive matter (airtipov) of Anaximander,which is indefinite and into which things pass again as they have emergedfrom it, new worlds arising and passing away, with the matter of the Samkhyaschool : apart from the fact that the nature of the Samkhya is not shown to

be as old a conceptionas Anaximander, and that it is essentially possessed of three constituents, and even rectifying the theory by placingin the position of Prakrti the vague conceptionof the Brahmanas as to the primitive nature of the universe, the parallelismis far too weak to be of any value as proof. In the case of Herakleitos the argument is even more unsatisfactory : the doctrine of the constant flux of things (iravra pel)is certainly comparable with the movement of nature in the Sarhkhya system and to some degree in Buddhism, and his belief in the innumerable annihilations and re-creations of 

the universe may be compared with the view of the Samkhya of the destruc tion and re-creation of the world.1 But, apart from the fact that the comparison of the doctrine of constant movement with the Samkhya system of the developmentof Prakrti is far from important,in view of the complete distinction between the two ideas of development,it must be pointed out once more that the Samkhya systemis not provedto be, and most probably wasnot by any means, as earlyas the systemof Herakleitos, and the doctrine of the periodic destruction of the universe, which is probably caused in India bythe doctrine of transmigration,is not recorded in one of the older Upanisads, and is clearly a late development ; Garbc himself rejects the theory that it is known to the Atharvavcda.2 It is hardly necessaryto add that it is quite out of the question to regard Empedoklcs as borrowing from India his view that nothing can arise from nothing : the same view is undoubtedly held by the Samkhya, but is as emphatically not normally held by the Upaiiisads. Nor is it of any importancethat the character of that teacher as a prophet, a magician, a believer in purification, and a mystic is comparablewith certain types of Indian sage. The view that the world is incapable of producing similar figures under similar or even different circumstances is one whichmust be proved first before mere similarities prove anything, and Empedokles'claim to be a god, degraded to earth, is un- Indian, being derived from the Orphic doctrine of man's defilement. The fact that a dislike to flesh as food sprung up among the believers in transmigration like Empedokles is perfectly true :3 it is, however, striking that in India itself the belief was of more tardy appearance as at all general than the date of Empedokles,4 and was not so far as we can see caused by the doctrine of transmigration. The great sage, Yajnavalkya, with whose name the doctrines of the Upanisadsare mainly connected, was a beef-eater with decided views as to the condition in which he ate it. It is also argued that the position of the gods in the view of Demokritos, who holds with Empedokles that nothing arises from nothing,is precisely the position of the godsin Indian thought,as seen in the Upanisads, where they

cease to be anything more considerable than a number of superior beings, not very essentially different from men. But this argument is clearly of no

weight. 

Though Garbe is in favour of the view that these comparisons are proofsof borrowing, he confines his assurance of dependence to the case of Pythagoras, which has been accepted by von Schroeder* and Hopkins2 with others8 as a clear case of the influence of Greek philosophy on Indian speculation. The

question cannot be ignored nor easily disposedof. The theory of Pythagorasclearly included the belief in transmigration, the idea that a series of births serves to purify the souls, and the view that the contemplative life is the highest form of existence and that man by livingit most effectivelystrives to rid himself of the fetters of nature. It is, therefore, argued that he must haveborrowed his conception from India, as there is no earlier trace of metempsy chosis in Greece, and the principle must therefore have come from an external source. Further arguments are based on detailed coincidences, which mustat once be admitted to be of great value in such a question,if only they could be established. The prohibitionto eat beans, the rule of ceremonial purity regarding the sun (Trpos ^Xtov Terpa/i/xcvov /AT/ 6/xtx ^)> the vow of silence like that taken by an Indian Muni, the Pythagorean theorem, the irrational root 2, the character of the religious philosophical brotherhood treated as similar to the Indian philosophical schools, and the mystic character of the doctrine are all regarded by Hopkins as valid evidence of the connexion. Other argumentshave also been adduced by von Schroeder, but have been abandoned by his own supporters : thus the theory that the Pythagorean numbers are borrowedfrom the Samkhya system is given up even by Garbe, in face of the fact that in that system number plays no part save in so far that three Gunas andtwenty-five principles are enumerated, and the Pythagorean conception of number is something totallydifferent.4 The further argument adducedby Garbe that the five elements are borrowed by Pythagoras from India is open to the grave objection that the five elements are not certainly known in India early enough for this, but to the still more grave objection that the

One may justly philosophy (Aristotle, dc An. i. 2. 5 ; dismiss as ludicrous Garbe's suggestion Plotinus, Enn. i. 6. 9) may be due to that Pythagoras invented his system Eastern sources, although a conscious as a result of misunderstanding in statement of the doctrine appears iirst formation given to him as to the in Buddhaghosa in the fifth century Samkhya.

system of five elements cannot be traced back to Pythagoras himself, andfurther that the five by no means precisely correspond with the five of India in the concepts attached to them ; the efforts1 to show that the word 6A,*as as used by Philolaos of the ether is the imperfect transcript of the Aka$a of the Indian tradition must be deemed to be methodologically completely mistaken. 

The detailed evidence of the arguments adduced is quite insufficient to prove the propositions contended for.8 The origin of transmigrationin Greece is probably to be traced to Thrace, and it seems to have been spread by the Orphics, whose views in partat least appear to have been brought forward in a rational form by Pythagoras: it cannot be traced, as so often urged,to 

the personal activity of Pythagoras: it was known by Empedoklesand byPherekydes, and was recognized by Pindar :8 it is most probablethat in Thrace it developeditself in connexion with the belief in the temporaryembodiment of the divinityin animal form revealed in the Dionysiac rites : the Mainads, the Bakchai, with their close communion with nature, their adoption of animal garb,their tearing of the animal who represented the god, their efforts to producestates of ecstasy, portrayedfor us by the master handof Euripides, suggest the source from which the belief could grow.4 Thestory of the Thracian Zamolxis is clear proofof the belief as existingin Thrace.6 There was also no such spirit in Greek religion, as would preventthe ready acceptance of the view. On the contrary, it may be noted that the idea of the transfer of one soul into another body was familiar from such tales as that of Kirke and the comrades of Odysseus, and the daimons of Hesiod suggest a mode of transition. The fact that transmigration appearsalso among the Druids, and has independently grown up with other peoplesis of importance. The case of Egypt where Herodotos7 held that transmigration prevailedis difficult : the view may have been held by a sect there, though its existence is not yet established, but this possibility does not appearto be of fundamental

importance. The doctrine much more probably originatedin Thrace than at any other point in the Greek area, and its development beyond crude outlines was the work of the Greek religious and philosophical genius, as will be shownbelow. 

The effort to show that the Pythagorean theorem and the problemof the square root of the number two are older in India than in Pythagoras,is based on a mistake : the error was certainlyin great measure favoured by Cantor, who declared that the Indian versions of these matters must be based on those of Greece, and it was, therefore, easy for von Schroeder to arguethat the relation must be the other way, that the Indian versions occurred in works

which were much older than the versions recorded in Greece. The fact is that the ulba Sutras which contain the earliest mentions of these matters are of uncertain date : they are nominally partsof the ritual Sutras, in the sense that they bear the name of the school, and it is urged that further they are so 

essentially connected with the structure of the sacred altars that they must be held to be early. The arguments for their age cannot be taken as at all con clusive :x the Siitras of the schools were works without internal connexion of such a kind as to render it in the slightest degree difficult to interpolate, andthat the ulba Sutras may not have been added longafter the rauta Sutras were composed it would be absurd to contend. The existing Sutras have noappearance of great antiquityin any way : they have new technical terms, but little or none of the irregularities of construction and the archaic phraseo logy which justify us in placing some of the rauta Sutras about the fourth century B. c. s and even then of course the date assignedto them would be too late,to prove borrowing by Pythagoras. We may legitimately assume that they were composedat the close of the Sutra period, when interest in their sub ject-matter had developed. What is more important, and what, it may beadded, tells against borrowing by India in this regard from Greece, is that examination of the Sutras2 has shown that complete generality of the theoremof Pythagoras was never attained and was not even striven after. Thepractical form of the problem was known to the Egyptians and Babylonians, long before it was known to the Sutras.3 The same remark applies to the alleged knowledge of the theorem of the irrational the mere approximate calculation of the root of two, which is all the Sutras attained, is far from

being equivalent to the discovery of the solution of an irrational. The real period when these questions came to be discussed in India was doubtless at a date considerably later than Pythagoras not before the third century B.C. in all likelihood, when the ingenuity of the Brahmans began to deal with the questions of the signification of the exact details of the measurements of the sacrificial ground. The Brahmanas themselves are guiltless of any knowledgeof the discussions of numbers, and this is proof positive that the speculations found in the ulba Sutras are of later origin. 

The other resemblances in detail are negligible: the prohibitionof the eating of beans, and the rule regarding the respect due to the sun, are examples of taboos of a common sort which are ethnic, and are not subjects of borrowing : the latter being found in Hesiod,1 it is hardly intelligible how it should havebeen considered by Hopkins to be valid as an argument for Indian borrowing.2 The vow of silence taken by the Muni is, on the one hand, not a common idea in the Upanisads, and it cannot be shown to be as early there as the date of Pythagoras : on the other hand, silence as an observance for all sorts of reli gious and magic purposesis ethnic.3 The character of the Pythagoreanbrotherhood bears no real similarity to the Indian, save such as is inherent in every case where any men agree together in any belief. The evidence of early Greece points to the existence of such societies for two centuries before Pythagoras, and his own society seems to have developed a political activity of a truly Greek kind :4 in the India of the Upanisads we have nothing recorded precisely similar to these societies : we have instead the phenomenaof individual teachers with pupils wandering here and there in disputations, of a closed or mystic brotherhood not one trace. Nor is it reasonable to lay any stress on the comparison of the speculationsof the Brahmanas as being fantastic with those of Pythagoras on the theory of number ; that every fantastic system is derived from another is an absurd proposition, and the kinds of fantasy are quite different. 

Moreover it is right to note that the spirit of Pythagoras is different in essentials from the spirit of the Upanisads. Plato 111 the Phaidon5gives as older than Philolaos, and perhaps as already held by Pythagoras, the view that the soul of man is a strangerin the world, that the body is the tomb of the soul, and that yet we may not seek to escape from it, for we are the chattels of God, and he is our herdsman, and we may not leave it without his command.This religious attitude is clearly, as will have been seen from the account of the Upanisads, wholly at variance with the thought of those texts. In the

second place, there is a real pointof difference between the form of the belief in transmigration of Pythagoras and that of the Upanisads: it is expressly and sarcastically recorded of Pythagoras that he recognizedin the howling of a dog the voice of a friend, and that he claimed to remember his former births.1 These characteristics arc not to be found in the doctrine of the older Upanisads : the doctrine of the recollection of former births is only recorded 

later,2 and'the recognitionof the voice of a friend is a peculiarity of the Greek imagination, displaying a humour which in India the doctrine of trans migration does not excite in the times of the Upanisads. Further the Indian doctrine of knowledge resulting in emancipationis not to be found in Pytha goras, who was a believer in the essential character of purification, probably in origin a physical purification,3 but soon transformed into one of moral character. 

It is in fact hopelessto seek any real derivation of Greek philosophy from India : the allegedtravels of Pythagoras and others to India arc foolish andlate inventions, of no real value whatever. The efforts made, and often most uncritically accepted,to find the influence of Pythagorean views derived from India on Plato is hopeless: the fact that Plato believes in the bondage of the soul in matter and in its immortality and transmigrationis made the ground for the belief that he is indebted to the Samkhya philosophy byBarthelemy St. Hilaire,4 a view which would be comic if it were not endorsed by the authority of Hopkins. The broad fact which should be recognized

610 The Philosophy ofthe Veda [Part V  

is that, the nature of the problem of existence being the same everywhere, and the mind of man not being essentiallydifferent in the India of the Upanisads and the Greece of the Pythagoreans and Plato, the results of the philosophy tend to resemble each other in diverse points.1 But in philosophy it is not the results which matter : the solution of the riddle of the universe is, 

we may feel assured, reserved for no mortal, and the comparativevalue of twophilosophies, even when the results in the mere sphereof theory as opposed to practical philosophyare similar, dependsin the main on the methods adopted. In this respect the discrepancy between the Upanisads and Plato is sufficient to make us realize from what different foundations the structures of the twoedifices of thought were raised. 

One further pointof suggestedcontact between Indian and Greek thought should be noted, as it has the supportof the authority of Garbe.2 Weber3 suggested that there might possibly be some degree of dependence on India through Alexandria of the philosophyof Nco-Platoriism in its doctrine of the Logos, as compared with the position of Vac, speech,in the Brahmanas. In that literature, as we have seen, Vac now and then appearsas the instrument by which the creator god carries out the processof the creation of the universe. Moreover, in a few passagesthere is a suggestion that Vac is even higher than her normal lord, Prajapati: thus at the Vajapeya offering we learn that someoffered to her the last of the seventeen oblations in the hope to win her,4 and she is credited with the creation of the whole universe and identified with Vicvakarman.5 The conceptionof speechas the final powerin the uni verse, which thus grows up naturallyin the Brahmanas, is contrasted byWeber with the sudden and unexpected appearanceof the Logos in Greekphilosophy. Garbc, acceptingthis view, pressesit further : the Logos in Greek philosophy came to Nco-Platonism through Philo, and he borrowed it from the Stoics,6 who in their turn inherited it from Hcraklcitos whosedependence on India for his philosophyis thus triumphantly proved.7 Thewhole theory is clearly without any solid foundation of truth : the essence of the view that the sporadicdoctrine of the importanceof Vac should havegiven rise to the very definite and clear conceptionof the Logos8 is in itself wholly incredible, seeing that at the most it is reasonable to assume that a

Langdon 255-81) suggests that the Stoie doctrine (JRAS. 1918, pp. 443 ff.) arguesfor of logc, physics, and ethics owes much a Babylonian origin of the Logos as to India, but his parallelisms often cosmic, connected with the primeval just and forcible prove nothing save waters, suggesting that Thales derived the similarity of the mind of man. his doctrine of water as the origin of 7 If Hertcl's doctrine of Brahman as fire things from Babylonian thought.Chap. 29] Greece and the Philosophy of India 611  

view which was widely spread and normal in the philosophy of India mightbe conveyed by chance to Greece : to assume this of an idea which plays comparatively speaking no part in the Brahmanas and which in the Upanisads, i.e. in the early philosophyof India, has no part at all, is contrary to all plausibility.1 

The true relation between Greek and Indian philosophy can be seen clearly frcftn the parallel which, quite legitimately, has been drawn2 betweenthe view of Empedokles and of Pakudha Kaccayana, whose opinionsarc recorded for us by Buddhist texts. The date of the views of the latter teacher is such that it is absurd to assume that his opinions, which were obviously never widely held, could have reached Greece and influenced Empedokles.Kaccayaiia asserted the existence of seven distinct elements whose interaction gave rise to the world of experience, namely earth, air, fire, water, pleasure and pain as sources of attraction and repulsion,arid the soul, Jiva. The first six of these factors clearly correspond closely with the four elements of Empedokles, to which he added love and strife as sources of motion. Bothagree in regarding their elements as unchanging, both recognize pores in organized bodies,3 both deny the existence of a void. Yet the fact that Pakudha Kaccayana accepted the existence of soul reminds us that he derives from a philosophic* tradition to which the conception of souls was familiar, while Empedokles' opinions are based on a naturalistic philosophy, although, like Kaccayana, he believes in the doctrine of transmigration. 

When in Anaxagoras we find Nous introduced as an clement, comparisonwith the Ssimkhya is far from convincing, for nor merely is Nous one, not many, but it clearly bore no resemblance in nature or function to the Purusaof the Samkhya. 

Parallelism again is the cause of most of the similarities which have often been traced between Indian thought and post-Aristotelian philosophy. Garbe has, very wisely, discounted much of the borrowing assumed by the pioneer researches of Lasscn,4 but his own efforts to trace borrowings from the Samkhya in the case of Plotiiius arc far from happy. The doctrine that the soul is in reality free from sorrow, which, on the contrary is essentially 

involved in the world of matter, is the development of a Platonic conception, and farther back is Orphic in origin. The conception of the soul as light is Aristotelian, and, as it is an essential doctrine of the Upanisads, derivation 

from the Sfiriikhyain any event would be wholly unnecessary. The metaphorof the mirror applied to the explanation of consciousness of knowledge is traced by Garbe to the Samkhya, though we have not a scrapof proof that the school knew the doctrine fgr centimes after his date, since the Karika is

612 The Philosophy ofthe Veda [Part V  

absolutely silent regardingit. The fact that the systemof Plotinus is directed to freeing man from misery follows from his own doctrine, nor in any case could it be made specially Samkhyan in derivation, and the same observation applies to the view of Plotinus that even in sleep happinessis possible since the soul docs not sleep. His reduction1 of all souls to one (ctTrucrat atif/v^al /u'a) 

is, of course, opposed to the Samkhya, and can be explained perfectly well without the introduction of derivation from the Vedanta. His belief in the turning away of the mind from things of the sense and the achievement of a condition of union with the divine in ecstasy is parallel with the Pratibha, intuitive knowledge,2 of the Yoga doctrine, but it also follows inevitably from

the foundations of his philosophy. 

It is remarkable also that, though in the case of Porphyry (A. D. 232-304) we know that he used Bardcsancs and actually reproduces remarks of his regarding the Brahmans, we iind nothing conclusive of borrowing from the Samkhya. The distinction which he makes between spirit and matter is merely in keeping with the views of Plotinus ; equallyso arc the doctrines of the superiority of spirit to matter, of the omnipresence of the soul when freed from matter, and of the fact that the world has no beginning. His objection to sacrifice and the slaying of animals might be traced with Lasseii to Buddhismwith far greater likelihood than to Lhc Samkhya, but it has historical antece dents in Greece. Abammon's doctrine of the remarkable magic powerspossessed by personsin ecstasy agrees perfectly with Buddhist views as well as those of the Brahmans, but we cannot forget the delusions attributed byEuripides to the Bakchai and in special to Pcnthcus. We may see an echo of the Samkhya Gunas in the Gnostic divisions of men as m>vp.a.TiKoi\ \I/VXIK<, anduXtKot', and in the accordingof personalexistence to such mental states as the intellect, will, &c., in the manner in which existence is assignedto Buddhi, Ahamkura, Manas, &c. But the case for real borrowing is far from certain ; in the later case Iranian influence is probablyat work ; in other instances, as in the system of Basilidcs, Buddhist influence is clear.3 

On the other hand the efforts which have been made by Satis ChandraVidyabhusaiia 4 to establish the gradual receptionin India of Greek logic, while ingenious and interesting, are equally without assured ground. It is, indeed, far more probable,if borrowing really took place, that India obtained the impulse to logical investigation from Greece in a general way and pro ceeded more suo to develop her doctrines without detailed intervention of Greek ideas. At least this would suit the history of Indian logic far moresatisfactorily than the suggestionsof Vidyabhusana, whose readiness to ]<< _! -i A- Greek influence is, however, admirable testimony to the scientific spirit in which his valuable researches were conducted. Nor in any case is there any doubt that he is perfectlyin the rightin distinguishing,as against 1 Enn. iv. 9 ; Deussen, Allgem. Gesch. der (1918) ; Reitzensteiu, Die hellenisti

the contentions of Barua and others, the use of syllogism from the theoretical exposition. A similar error, as has been seen, has led Burk and Garbeto hold that at the time of the Taittiriya Samhita the Pythagorean problemwas known, when in truth all that is recorded is the correct measurementof the sides of a right-angled triangle. 

We have in fact to admit that the human spirit, in virtue of its character, is able to produce in different parts of the world systems which agree in large measure, without borrowing by one side from the other. The stress laid in the cave metaphor in the Republic by Plato, as by Parmenides, on the relative unreality of the world of sense and experience bears a certain similarity to the conception of the Brahman as alone real, but Plato was the inheritor of the Sophists and Sokratcs, and as a result his philosophy is something vitally distinct from any known to India. The metaphor of the chariot and its steeds in the Phaidros has, as we have seen, an interesting parallel in the Katha, but the details of the two are perfectly distinct, for Plato uses the con ception to illustrate the struggle between the rational and the irrational elements in the soul, and his distinction of Ovfjujs and C70v/ua has no real parallel in the Upanisads. In the Brhadaraiiyaka Upanisad* we hear of procreation as the result of the desire for reunion of the two halves of the primitive being, divided by Prajapati into man and woman. The brilliant myth in the Symposion of Plato has been compared by Dcussen,2 who argues that the view departs from truth merely in that it places in the past what lies in the future, for the being that brings together man and woman is the child that is to be born. The two passages must certainly be independent, andafford an excellent instance of what parallelisms can be adduced. 

Yet another instance is 1 hat of the five elements. As Deussen3points out there arc characteristic differences between the two lists which show a divergence of origin ; the Greeks place fire between ether and air, the Indians air which is reallyfor them wind, Vayu between ether and lire. Moreover

there is a perfectly simple natural fact to which the scries corresponds, the division of states of matter into the solid, the fluid, the fiery or gaseous, the elastic, and the imponderable, which could not fail to win early attention. In point of fact we can trace in Greek philosophy the gradual emergence of the doctrine of the five elements in a perfectly characteristic manner. Thales claimed water as the primary source of reality, Anaximenes air, Ilcrakleitos fire, Parmenides, in the part of his work dealing with opinion as opposed to true knowledge, admitted the hot and the cold, fire and earth, and Empedokles, accepting four, set fire off against the other three, and, in a wholly un-Indian 

manner, experimentally proved air to be different from space. The fifth element was added, whether under the title'ether'or not, by the school of Pythagoras, not himself, and is derived from a conception of a Trvcfyxa surrounding the world, which is also regarded as space.4

A. THE AGE OF THE AVESTA AND THE RIGVEDA

AN effort definitely to establish the date of the reform of Iranian religion by Zoroaster has been made by J. Hertel,1 who seeks to trace the activity of the prophet from 559-522 B.C., a result of much importance in view of the probability that 110 very great interval of time can intervene between the Rigveda and the Gathas of the Avesta. 

Stress is naturally laid by Hertel on the fact that the religion of the Persians as described by Herodotos contains nothing specifically Zoroastrian, while it accepts much that Zoroaster rejected, especially the direct veneration of nature gods, and the animal sacrifice ; moreover Herodotos records the drunkenness of the Persians, which may be connected with the Haomaoffering, the fear of defilingfire or water, and the practice of the Magoi of permitting the bodies of the dead to be torn by birds or beasts, matters whichare not recognized in the Gathas. Hence it may be concluded that Zoroaster's activity fell at no great date before the reign of Xerxes I. Nor can we formany reasoned judgement to the contrary on the strength of the view of Xanthos of Lydia, a contemporary of Artaxerxes I (465-424 B.jc.), whoplaces Zoroaster 6,000 years2 before the expedition of Xerxes, or the slightly variant account of Aristotle which makes him 6,000 years before the death of Plato.3 

The Persian inscriptions show Dareios I as a believer in Auramazda,who is clearly the god of Zoroaster, not the sky god of the nature worshipof the Persians, whose name Herodotos heard under a form akin to the Indian Dyaus. The devotion of Dareios to this god can be accounted for only by the view that he was the deityof his branch of the family of the Achaimenidai. Dareios had to struggle against the hostility of the Magoi, representing the traditional faith, and it was his earnestness under the influence of the prophet's teaching, which secured the sudden predominance of the Zoroastrian view, despite its abstract character and lack of popular elements. But this meansthat Zoroaster had lived just before Dareios or was still alive, for if he had

lived some centuries before, and his religion had still at the time of Dareios been of so small account, it could never have suddenly expanded to important dimensions. This view, in Hertel's opinion,is strengthened by the terms usedby Dareios himself, when he asserts that the earlier kings had failed to accom plish what in one year he had wrought by the aid of Auramazda, and when headvises his successors to punish the adherents of the lie. His successors omitthis warning, which was only in place when a new god was being first pro claimed. Under Artaxerxes II (404-359 B. c.) we find Auramazda worshipped along with Mithra and Anahita, showing the contamination of Zoroastrianism with the older nature worship under the influence of the Magoi, who hadaccepted the duty of preaching the new faith, but naturally permeated it with ideas of the older belief.

The Age ofthe Avesta and the Rigveda 615  

Ingenious as are the argumentsof Hertel, it is clearly impossibleto accept them as adequateto provehis thesis that Zoroaster was an earlier contem porary of Dareios I. The attitude of the king is certainly that of the adherent of a faith who believes stronglyin his god ; it does not prove that the faith was a new one ; it mightwell have existed for some centuries in comparative obscurity, to be brought into prominence by the moral earnestness of a kingwho shared the spirit of the founder of the reformed faith and of his successors. The evidence a prioriis simply negativein direction, and the conclusion drawn by Hertel is wholly uncertain, unless it can be supported by other evidence. 

Such evidence Hertel finds in the Parsi tradition which gives soincllimjr like 595-594 B. c. as the openingof Zoroaster's ministry and makes* him live about 660-583 B.C. The date is earlier than his own, but in view of the deplorable nature of the Parsi tradition generally, he deems this of no impor tance, and refers to the fact that Anquctil du Perronl arrives at the date 559 B. c. for the beginning of Zoroaster's work, on the strengthof the fact that a religious sect, which immigrated into China about A.D. 600 and which is evidently of Zoroastrian origin, had an era dating approximately from that time, which Anquetil interpretedas fixed by the prophet's leaving his homeand entering on his mission. For the accuracy of the tradition the best argument to be adduced is that, if Zoroaster had not lived at a comparatively later epoch, the Parsis would not have broughthis date down, since no sect willingly depreciates the ageof its founder. Here, however, we are left to mereguess-work, and we have a very formidable isij.u'ii'-nl to confront in the fact that tradition docs not make the patronof Zoroaster, ViStaspa,identical with the father of Dareios until as late as Ammianus Marccllinus (5th cent. A.D.), whose evidence in this regard, Hertel very frankly admits, is worthless. 

The later Avesta in fact and the Parsi tradition ascribe the patron of Zoroaster to a Kavi dynasty, founded by a certain Kavata ; moreover it is silent ](; rding the great Persian kings who favoured the faith. It also, like the Greek tradition, gives Zoroaster the positionof one of the Magoi. In Hertel's view the dynastyof Kavi is a pure invention, Kavi ViStaspain the Avesta really denoting merely the king2 Vistaspa ; the omission to mentionthe Achaimenidai is due to the oppositionof Dareios to the Magoi, and the connexion of Zoroaster with that body is mythical.3 On the contrary, in vv. 8 and 9 of the Gatha (Yasiia, liii.) Hertel finds a direct encitement to ViStaspa to overthrow the usurper Gaumata and the Magoi, the passage dating shortly before Dareios acted on the hint in lieu of his father, and brought about by treacherythe destruction of the Magoi.This suggestion, however, seems wholly implausible. The verses form partof the utterance of the prophet at the marriage- of his dsnigliter Pourucista ; what he says naturally applies generally to evil-doers and to their punishment by the Lord, and it is illc^il imntf to read into them an admonition, carefully disguised from motives of prudence under a double entendre in the later Indian style. 

Hertel naturally rejects the argument4 in favour of an earlier date of Zoroaster derived from the occurrence of Mazdaku as a royal name in Media* Jackson, op. cit. 9 p. 165. C. Clemen's important work, Die 8 But Vistaspa does not appearas a king griechischen und lateinischen Nach

about 715 B.C., on the ground, also adopted by Jackson, that the name neednot be derived from Mazdah as a divine name, but merely from the word in its signification of wisdom, parallel to Sanskrit medhd. The occurrence of Assara MazaS as a divine name in an inscription of the seventh century B. c. probably, in view of its form, carries back the existence of Ahura Mazdah to a period before the life of Zoroaster, so that, even if the royal name weretheophoric, it would prove nothing for the date of Zoroaster.1 

It remains, therefore, impossible to establish with any certainty Zoroaster's date. The views of Hertel rest on a priori reasoningso far as they have anyvalidity ; the tradition which supports them as regards date contradicts themon the vital point of ancestry, and there are certain considerations of high importance to be set againsthis contentions. In the first place, we find Greekreports as early as the fifth century B.C. placing Zoroaster in the very remotepast ; in the second place, the younger Avesta already treats Zoroaster as amythical figure. It is very difficult to reconcile these facts with the theory that Zoroaster was alive as late as 522 B.C., and it must be recognized that eventhe Parsi tradition declines to place him as late as that, for it is out of the question to take seriously the suggestionof Anquctil, on which Hertel relies for his upper date of 559 B. c. as the beginning of the work of the prophet. 

It seems, therefore, that the date of the Gathas of the Avesta must remainunascertained ; it remains, however, to consider the value of the evidence adduced by Hertel regarding the position of the Rigveda. He finds*in that text evidence of hostility to the tenets of Zoroaster openly expressed,in the con demnation of the brahmadvis2 and the devanid* The doctrine of the Brah man was held by persons who insisted on negatingthe pre-existcnce and future existence of each individual ; the believers in the Daena of Zoroaster, for which the younger Avesta has Frava&i, held opposing views, and thus canbe censured as brahmadvis. Similarly the Zoroastrians were the only persons known to us who degraded the gods of the Aryans to demons. The answerin either case seems irresistible ; the devanid of the Rigveda is most naturally and normally appliedto the non-Aryan foes of the Vedic Indians, and the brahmadvis is even more obviously not to be interpreted in the strange waysuggested by Hertel, whose assertion that the believers in the doctrine of Brahman did not accept an individual pre-existence and future existence of the soul is a pure hypothesis, quite unsupported by anything which we knowof any historical Brahman doctrine as opposed to that invented by Hertel,4 in which, doubtless, the individual is to be regarded as the result of the streaming out of the cosmic fire, into which he is reabsorbed. Hertel docs not state how he connects this view with the obvious belief in transmigration of the Upanisads. Even more remarkable is his assertion that in Rigveda vii. 104. 2 the term brahmadvis is appliedto a Pi9aca, the Pi9acas being a canni balistic race found in the Indus valley and in the Hindu Kush. Apart fromany dubiety as to the correctness of Grierson's views on Piyacas,6 there is the uncontrovertible fact that Pi^aca does not appear in the passage cited at all, which clearly and obviously applies to a Raksas, the hymn being directed against these demons. Even on Hertel's own theory it is obvious that it is 

1Maspero (op. cit., pp. 455, 572) argues that trianism, pp. 269 If.), the name Phraortes denotes Fravartis,2 Die Zeit Zoroasters, p. 02. 'confessor'of the Zoroastrian faith,8 IF. xli. 200. The term oceurs only in RV. which, of course, would give an early i. 152. 2; vi. Gl. 3.

unlucky that the Rigvedashould apply the same term brahmadvip to the Zoroastrians and to a race of eaters of dead bodies, who are severely censured and denounced in the Avesta.1 Nor does he adduce any reason why, even onhis own theory, the term should not always apply to Piacas, if it actually once does so. 

It appears impossiblealso to derive any results as to the age of the Rigvedaor the Avesta from the discovery of Aryan elements in the speechesof Asia used in the Hittite Empire, Sumerian, Babylonian or Akkadian, Kanisian (Hittite), Luvian, Balaian, Charrian, Proto-Hittitc, and that of the Manda.2 That Indo-European elements of centumtype may be traced in Kanisian andLuvian is quite natural in view of the obvious activity of the Indo-Europeantribes. More immediate value attaches to the evidence of the Aryan speech of the Manda tribes on the borders near Mitanni, to whose speech Forrer ascribes the names of Mitanni gods, which as pronounced he holds to have beenMidrassil, Ur(u)vanassil, Nasattiyana, and Indar. The first three names are preceded by the determinative An (-Me) which marks them as denoting groups of gods, which may as regards Mitra and Varuna serve as an indication of their being closely united. The variant Arunassil is regarded as due to influence by the Kanisian word arunas, ocean, a view interestingif it may be taken as indicating a connexion between Varuna and the ocean in the mindsof the Manda tribes. As Manda also he classes the terms of horsc-brceding and training found in a text emanating from a man of Mitanni ; they include in his view, aika-vartanna,*one round ', ieravarlanna or terortanna,'three rounds ', panzavartanna, sattavartanna, satvarlanna, navartanni vasannasaya, 4 in nine rounds of the stadium ', and auzomewa,fcrun ', in which he sees the -waof an infinitive termination comparable to Vedic -mane and -vane, drawing the further conclusion that in a period prior to the periodof Indo-European speech unity there existed a spirant which in Kanisian became a v sound, in Greek andLuvian an m sound. This is much too speculative ; what is clear is that the numerals are by no means Vedic and that they can be set down as Aryan with equal plausibility. We are, therefore, still left without any definite evidence to aid us in dating the distinction of Aryan into Iranian and Indian, and weshould probably revise our conception of this division. In an area of consider able extent over which Aryan was spoken we may assume dialectical differences sprang up, accelerated in development by contact with different racial elements, and the fragments of Mitanni speech akin to Aryan found of late represent developments of what may conveniently be called Aryan, not cither Iranian or Indian. This natural hypothesis removes the need of imagining movements back from India to the west, while the possession of some gods in common well accords with the Aryan character of the speech. 

Ilertcl 3accepts as proved Ipsen's effort4 to establish the theory that the period of Indo-European unity lasted until the period 2000 B . c. The evidence, however, for this thesis is inadequate ; it rests merely on the view that the prototype of the Indo-European variants of the word star5 could only havebeen borrowed then. It is, however, obvious that, even if we assume that the word was borrowed, the evidence is quite insufficient to establish either the date or the unity of the Indo-Europeans at the time of the borrowing.

is fairly well established is only the existence in the latter partof the first half of the second millennium B. c. of dialects which may generically be styled Aryan, and which have developed beyond the hypothetical language, which may be regarded as Indo-European. 

Peake,1 who arguesfor the Indo-Europeans,or Wiros, as of Nordic race, with heads rather narrow than broad, transparent skin, light hair, and grey eyes, settled in the steppescast of Dnieperabout 3000 B.C., holds that drought about 2200 B. c. sent some of them to the Iranian plateau where they appear as the Kassites,2 while the Aryas proper, speakingIndo-Iranian dialects, were still living togetherin Russian Turkestan in 2000 B.C. He places about 1760 B. c., contemporaneouslywith the Kassite occupationof Mesopotamia,the separation of the Indians and the Iranians. The Mitanni barons he regards as a group of Aryas who spoke a language with Iranian affinities and separated themselves from the main body somewhat after 2000 B. c., rejecting Sayce's suggestion that they were Phrygians, who entered their territory fromThracian homes in the west. Yet other Wiros established their powerin the Hittite Empire,3 which they reached via Gallipoli. This reconstruction is interesting, but it lacks decisive proofof any kind. The Hungarian home of the Wiros claimed by Dr. Giles4 he rejects, save in so far as he admits that many of the Wiros may have been descendants of the late Aurignacian andSolutrean horse-hunters, and that they may have developed the rudiments of their language in some post-Solutrean time within the Carpathian ring. TheGermanic origin of the Wiros is also wholly rejected, nor despite the argumentsof Kossinna 6 and others does it seem tenable.6 

Some would fix the Vcdic period byfirst establishing the probabledate of the Bharatan war, and then by reckoning of generations on the basis of epic or Purana genealogies dating certain kings who figurein the Rigveda. Thus the war is placed by various modern critics, contraryto tradition, about 950 B. c. 

or 850 B.C., whence it is deduced that some at least of the personagesof the Rigveda flourished no more than a coupleof centuries earlier.7 There is nothing impossiblein such a result, but it must be confessed that it is difficult to put any faith on the epic or Purana genealogies, and that the probative value of such reasonings must be admitted to be minimal.8 Least of all is it 1 The Bronze Age and the Celtic World, chaps. route languageof Baltic-Mesopo

possible to find any supportfor the proposed date of the war in Jain tradition, which places Aristanemi, the second predecessor of Mahavira, contemporarywith Krsna. This can be made to support the date only by assuming a period of two hundred years between each Tirthamkara. For this idle assumptionwe have not the slightest evidence of any kind. The Jain tradition gives Parvanatha a semblance of reality by placing him 250 years before Mahavira, 

Aristanemi it banishes to the remotest antiquity, and we have not the slightest evidence otany kind that any Tirthamkara of that or any other name existed c. 950 B. c. Even the historical existence of Parcvanatha is totally unproved.But at any rate, since the Jains themselves did not believe that Aristanemi wasa figure of comparatively recent history,it is really otiose for us to rewrite their scriptures. 

B. THE SACRIFICE OF PURUSA AND THE ORIGINOF THE WORLD 

H. Giintert x has traced the common possession over an area extending from Germany, through the Thraco-Phrygian area, to the Indo-Iranians of a number of mythological elements, which are preservedfor us in complex andcontaminated forms in the religious records of these peoples. The first of these ideas is that of the origin of mankind and the world from the sacrifice 

of a primeval being, an idea suggested by the great potency which primitive religious thought ascribes to the bloody sacrifice.2 This is preserved for us in the legend of the sacrifice of Purusa and of Ymir, whose original character hestrongly defends against suggestionof Christian influence ; it is reflected also in the strange, though late, legend of Odin who records how for nine nights he hung on a tree, wounded by the spear, dedicated to Odin, himself to himself. The action of the god in permitting himself to be sacrificed is one of free will, motived by the desire to create the world and establish the race of men.Yama, he holds, is such a god ; the difficult passage of the Higveda, x. 13. 4, he explains as a reference to a deliberate decision by Yama to sacrifice himself for the sake of mankind ; it is as a sacrificer of himself that Yama performs the feat of finding the hidden Agni,3 who is the mediator in the sacrifice between the offerer and the gods. Later we find in Iran the conception of some sin in the primitive being, as in Yima, and, when the human sacrifice became antiquated, the creator as in the legend of Mithra slays a bull, not a human being.4 

The second motif is the belief that men are sprung from a primeval 

the Vergilian tradition (Coniparetti, the Catalogue of Ships (Iliad, ii.) as Virgilio in media evo). To treat as an invention (contrast T. W. Allen, historical the Indian traditions, which The Homeric Catalogue of Ships, 1921 ;

creature of bi-sexual character. This idea can be traced in Teutonic mythologyin legends of Tuisto, Ymir, Tveggi, in the Doias of Phrygia,in Prajapati andPurusa x in India, and in Zrvan in Iran, while the Yama legend shows the variant by which a twin sister is given to the primeval man, in order to explain the origin of man, a conception found also in Iran in the legendsof Yimak,Manusak, and MaSyanik. 

The third motif is the view that the first to die becomes, like Yama andYima, the lord of the blessed dead, and, like Yama, the judge Qf the dead. Further, he may be regardedas the ancestor of men, and in virtue of his paternal power a great king when on earth, and one whence royal families are fain to claim descent, ideas found in the legendsof Yima, JamSed, Yama, andthe Teutonic Mannus. The first mortal is also deemed the first sacrificer, like Manu and Yama, from whom as in the case of Maims in Iran priests claim their origin. 

Guntert, while admitting the possibility of Asianic originfor the myth of an androgynous primevalcreator of mankind, does not claim that the motifs discussed are Indo-European, but rather takes them as evidence of a long continued contact between the special peoples among whom they occur. Asimilar contact he finds2 suggested by the partial parallelisms of Odin-Wodanwith Varuna and Ahura Mazdah, the root idea in all these cases being,in this view, that of a lord and creator of the world, a cosmic magician, one of whoseaspects is that of him who binds the sinner, whence the name Varuna fromver, bind, while Mitra, whose name has a similar force,3 binds men together in bonds of social obligation. A connecting link between the Aryans and the Teutons may be seen in the Thracian deity Darzales, whose name denotes him as the binder, and who may be the source of the Egyptian Sarapis,4 while the Thracians and the Phrygians had a goddess Bendis with similar functions. Savitr again is merely a hypostasisof Varuna,5 the aspectin which the world lord stretches aloft his mighty hands, the beams of the sun, and his figure accords with the delineations of a god with mightyhands uplifted which are found freely in the German and Thraco-Phrygiaii areas, while a remnant of the idea is to be seen in the epithetfclong-handed'appliedto the Iranian demonBusyasta. 

The ingenuity of these suggestions deserves recognition, but it must be regarded as very dubious whether they really serve to establish the closer religious connexions between certain of the Indo-European peoples which are postulated. The case of Savitr is clearly unconvincing ; the parallelis too general to be of value ; the idea of representing the sun as of human formwith uplifted hands is one which might easily occur independently ; there is nothing specially distinctive in the resemblance of Odin and Varuna as magicians, and the evidence for the origin of the world from a primitive sacrifice is too slight to enable us to feel any assurance of a common origin. It must be added that the evidence for Yama as originally the primeval being from whose sacrifice the world springsis inconclusive, for the Rigvedic passage cited naturally denotes a sacrifice of Brhaspati, not of Yama, and says nomore than that Yama died. The finding of Agni by Yama does not absolutely

prove his divinity, and in any case has no necessary connexion with his sacrificing himself. Moreover the contention that the idea of the origin of the world in sacrifice must be old because it rests on the belief in the peculiar efficacy of human sacrifice, and that form of sacrifice is essentially primitive, is wholly speculative, and by no means probable. At least as good a case 

can be made out for the belief that the high value attached to the humanoffering is a product of religious development. This is so whether we take* the cause of human offerings "to be the desire to propitiate a god who naturally menaces human life, such as a god of death, of war, or of the sea, or whetherthe sacrifice is one of a man to represent the god ;2 in the latter case the offering of a man is associated with anthropomorphic conceptionsof deity, and, while we need not believe that animal conceptions are older, we certainly cannot think anthropomorphic the oldest.3 Substitution legends are aetio logical and mark a refined speculation, not primitive ideas. 

Giintert 4 contends that in the case of Yama a distinction must be madebetween the ideas of4 dead ',' human ', and* immortal'; Yama was a godwho permitted himself to be sacrificed, and therefore died, but he is not a man(manusa, mdnava). Thus the Atharvaveda5 describes him as the first of mortals (mdriya) to die, but not as a man, while the Rigveda6 refers to his innate immortality (Yamdsya jdtdm amfiam). But despitehis relation to Vivasvant it is impossible to deny his mortality by these distinctions ; what ever his origin, to the Vedic poet he was the first of men to die. 

C. THE ARYAN CONCEPTION OF THE HEAVEN

J. Hertcl 7 claims that in India and Iran alike we find the conceptionof the heaven as a great stone building,filled with light, through whose doors, the sun and the stars, the light of heaven shines upon men. For this view is adduced the reference in the Rigveda to the palaceof Varuna with a thousanddoors, which is asserted to be none other than the heaven with its stars. ForIran there is the narrative in Vendldad ii, which has long passed as the Iranian version of the legend of the flood, but in which we should rather see the account of Yama's reign in the golden age and of the way in which he con veyed the first to die through the opening of the heaven, i.e. the sun, into the heaven of light. It is, however, true that this original legend of the Magianfaith has been altered in the form in which we have it, since it could not, as it stood, be made consistent with the Zoroastrian doctrine of the fate of the dead. The Vara mentioned in the Vendldad is to be compared with the Vedic Vala,8 which is none other than the closed firmament which the lord of the heaven of light, Brhaspati, or sometimes Indra, cleaves in order to set free the ruddykine, i.e. the stars. Yet a further confirmation of the new interpretation of the Vendldad is seen in an obscure verse of the Rigveda,9 which is made to yield the sense that Manu adorned with flames the door of the heaven of Indra. By yet another conjecture we are to see in Rigveda x. 14. 2 (' Yama as the

It is clearly impossibleto accept this evidence as establishing the doctrine enunciated. That in one passage* Varuna's palace with a thousand doors should be spoken of, is not the slightest proof that the Vedic Indian normally regarded the firmament as a building filled with light, whose doers were the sun and the stars, and the rendering of Rigveda viii. 63. 1, which ascribes to Manu the making of flames in the heaven of Indra, is clearly impossible ;2 even on Hertel's hypothesis,all that Manu could naturally be said to do wouldbe to enter by a flaming door, not to create it, and in fact the term dhiyak here used refers clearly to devotion and not to flames. The version of Valais wholly implausible, while the interpretationof the Vendidad passageis accomplished merely by the processof inventing a meaning and explaining away everything which contradicts it by the theory of adaption to Zoroastrian ideas. Peculiarly gratuitous is the interpretation of Rigveda x. 14. 2, whichhas not the slightest reference to an overburdened earth, but merely to the winning of an abode which knows no ending in the sky. The whole doctrine that Yama removed the surplus population to the heaven because the earth was overcrowded is un-Vedic, and even the epic3 knows it not. For the Vedawe have merely the aetiological legendsof the expansion of the earth from a small nucleus, often by the action of a cosmic boar,4 and the wholly unconnected and late legend of the sinking of the earth in the ocean because the evil-minded Viyvakarman, son of Bhuvana, sought to bestow it upon the priest Kaeyapa,though no mortal had the right to do so.5 

There is, therefore, no ground to hold that the term acmanam svaryamin Rigveda, v. 50. 4, with the derivative v. 30. 8, refers to the firmament of stone which the Maruts cause to move. Quite different is vii. 86. 1, whichascribes to Varuna the motion of the lofty vault of heaven, that is the starry firmament, for that passage says nothing of the firmament as a building of stone. Wholly irrelevant also arc passagesin the Upanisads and later6 which treat of the sun as a stage on the way to the highest place ; this is not the viewof the Rigveda 7 which expressly prays that those who despise Vedic practices (apavrata) may be debarred from the sun itself, doubtless as the abode of the holy, not as the way to it ; Hertel himself recognizes that in ix. 113. 8 the pious man desires to win immortality in the place where is the closure of the sky, i. e. the sun. When in the Upanisads8 the moon appears as the door of the world of heaven, nothing whatever is said to suggest that this refers to anopening through which the waters of heaven arc poured forth ; clearly the reference is to the old idea that the souls of the dead go to the moon to dwell there, as the text in question expressly lays down. When the Aitareya Brahmana 9says that the rain springs from the moon and enters back into it, it says nothing of water from the heaven. Varuna's connexion with rain is sufficiently natural without deriving it from the fact that the firmament is his

Still less plausibleis the treatment of Brhaspatias merely lord of the fire heaven, who, therefore, can send down rain, or the assertion that the ruddykine which he sets free arc the stars who send rain, and that this conceptionof them is only explicable on the theory that they are doors to the fiery heaven. 

Final argumentsfor the view of Hertel are based on a new interpretation of the Tistrya legend1 as revealing the productionof rain through the over flowing of tjie celestial ocean VourukaSa through the stars as the openingsin the firmament, and on the view that the divine doors invoked in the Apr! hymns are really the sun, moon, and stars ; it is sufficient to note his admission that this view was already unknown to the author of Rigveda x. 70. 5, andto add that this ignorance was fully justified by the incredible nature of the 

theory.2 

D. THE DRINK OF IMMORTALITY 

G. Dumczil in his Le Fcstin cfIrmnortalite3 seeks to establish, despite the silence of the Veda, the existence of an Indo-European myth of the winning of the drink of immortality. From the epie legendof the churning of the oeean he derives a myth which tells how, in fear of death, the gods took counsel as to   

procuring a drink to preserve them from it. Visnu advises them to churn the ocean for it, and, after coming to terms with the demons, and obtaining the assent of the god of the ocean, they accomplish their end, producing the Amrta, and other good things, including Laksmi ; a poison engendered in the churning is drunk by iva, whose neck thus becomes blue. The Asuras, however, steal the Amrta, and demand Laksmi ; Visnu-Narayana, in female guise, accompanied by Nara, in similar costume, goes to them, and wins themover to give him the Amrta, which then he bears back to the gods. They pro 

ceed to drink the nectar ; the demon, Rahu, found among them is decapitated by Visnu, and the fall of his body produces much commotion of the earth. A fight follows, in which the Asuras, defeated by the gods,are banished to the earth and the waters, and the gods remain in definitive possession of the drink.4 

Dumczil seeks to show5 that on principle the silence of the Vedie texts is not fatal to the early character of the legend, considering that these texts show no disinterested narratives of legends, and that the philosophical thoughtof the Vedic age was not concerned with this special theme. Similarly, lie insists that the Avcsta represents most imperfectly the true Iranian nature beliefs. The argumentsa priori have weight, but it seems impossibleto accept his reconstructed primitive legend6 as established by the legendslie recounts, including the Scandinavian legendof the beer of the Ases, the Greek legendsof the war of the gods and the giants and of Prometheus and the Pithos of Im mortality, the Latin tale of Anna Perenna or its Christian version as AnnaPetronilla, a Celtic Grail legend and the Slav legendof Mikhailo Potyk andMaria, the white swan. Here and there in these talcs common ideas can beseen, often doubtless much transformed, but there is far too little evidence 1 Vast, viii .

to enable us to claim Indo-European antiquityfor the complex myth whichDumezil evolves from the scanty evidence. The conclusion to be drawn is rather against than for the epicas a source of early myths ; in truth what is in origin mythical is there often so transformed by imagination as to be barely recognizable, and a good deal more can be said for Hertel's contention that 

the Brahmanas present a much superior field for the discovery,in thin dis guises, of true nature myths. 

Dumezil further1 deduces as the basis of the legends the existence of an Indo-European festival in the spring, at which was drunk in communionthe sacred drink, originally a kind of beer derived from barley, which wasreplaced by wine in Greece, and by Soma among the Indo-Iranians. Withthis drink the Indo-Europeans associated the idea of life without end, and the success of the gods over the demons their rivals ; but in the rites of which wehave historical information many other elements of vegetation ritual haveintruded themselves. He negatives2 the idea that the mead was primitively the ambrosia ; nothing in the legends recalls either the special characteristics nor the mode of preparation of the hydromel. If in Greece the ideas of d/x,/fyo<r/'a and p.tOv were confused, it was because both lost their precise sense, and similarly in India the distinction between Amrta and Madhu wasobliterated by reason of the attraction of the idea of Soma. A trace of the old pre-eminence of beer is to be seen in a legendof the atapatha Brahmana,3 where the barley is declared to have alone remained faithful to the gods in their demon contests, while the episode in the epic of the poison which arose in the churning of the ocean is held to be a distant echo of the process of fermen tation of the beer which is aptto go too far, as in the narrative of the Kalevala.4 In these details again it is clearly impossibleto find any cogent proofof the existence of an Indo-European rite. 

Geldner 5 has suggested that references to the legend of the churning of the ocean are to be found in the Rigveda. Thus in v. 2.3 lie interprets the amrtamviprkvat, which the Purohita throws on the fire, as denoting the ghcc whichseparates itself out, as did the Amrta at the churning of the ocean. Againin i. 163 he holds that the poet is dealing, not with the sun-horse, but with the coming into being of the*Urross', whether from the sun (verse 2) or, along with the Soma, from the oeean (asi aomena samayd viprklah). The wholestress of the argument rests on the artificial sense ascribed to viprcin both passages, and it is quite impossibleto accept Geldner's suggestion, which is not repeated by Dumezil. 

Another and very different view of Amrta is put forward by Slaters6 as part of the quite implausible hypothesisof the predominance in India of a Dravidiaii civilization based on reaction to Egyptian influence. He suggests that Amrta was either Egyptian beer or the fermented juice of the date palm, palmyra, or coconut palm, the great intoxicating beverage of India, the art of making toddy of this kind having reached India from Mesopotamia, the home of the date palm cultivation. It is sufficient to observe that the makerof the conjecture appearsto be ignorant of the patent fact that Amrta in the Rigveda denotes beyond doubt the Soma drink, and there is no conceivable possibility of reconciling the description of the Soma plantas contained in Vedic references and the date palm.

The Indo-European Fire Cult 625  

E. THE INDO-EUROPEAN FIRE CULT 

That fire should be regardedin its own right as a divine power, worthy of worship, appears so natural that it is only reasonable to recognize such worship as Indo-European. The sanctity of Agni in the Rigveda is, of course, especially that of the fire regarded as the recipient of sacrifice and the bearer of oblations, but it seems wholly unjustifiable to suggest* that his sanctity arose from*his nature as the sacrificial fire ; rather he was the recipient of offerings as sacred in his own right. 

In Greece, in addition to Hephaistos, Hestia must, it seems, be accorded an origin as fire, especially the fire on the hearth, not the hearth with its fire as Farnell 2suggests. He bases this view on the identity of the words for hearth and for the goddess, but there seems no reason whatever for accepting this suggestion, which derives Hestia from vas, dwell, when it is at least as natural to assume that the name of the fire on the hearth was used to denote the hearth, and connexion with vas or possibly some other root with the signification of shiningor burning is easy.3 Moreover the earliest literary references point singularly clearly to a conception like that of Agni ; the Homeric Hymns 4 tell of Hestia as the goddess who haunts the house of Apollo in Pytho and from whose locks sweet unguents trickle down, and of her sitting in the middle of the house, taking the fat of sacrifice. Euripides5 definitely calls her the lady of fire and associates her with Hephaistos. AtDelphi we find her associated with the deathless fire in the Amphictyonic oath. Moreover the maintenance of a sacred fire in the Prytaneion at Athens, and the fact that it was regarded as in a sense the source of the Ionic colonies, because they carried thence the sacred fire, show clearly enough that the essential element in the idea is the fire, not the hearth. Nor is there anyevidence for the suggestion6 that the hearth in Mediterranean lands was built of sacred stones or that its sanctity is a reflex of the pillar cult of pre-Hellenic times. The parallelism of the expressions4Hephaistos is laughing' and* Hestia is laughing ', used of the crackling of the fire, suggests essential identity of both deities with fire. 

The rules in India which urge the householder to maintain a sacred fire, a duty especially incumbent on the king,is paralleled by the Greek evidence as to the fires of the Prytaneia and the Roman cult of Vesta, which bears adequate evidence of independence to render derivation from Greece unnatural. 

The fire of the Sabha clearly approaches the conceptionof these public fires in Greece and Rome. For the practicein Greece and Rome various explana tions have been offered. That of Frazer7 stresses the importance of preserving one fire at least in a village which would never be extinguished, while Farnell8 contends that the rite was religious in origin, depending on the belief that the fire on the hearth was the external thing in which the soul of the chief resided, so that the whole tribe had an interest in keeping it up ; when kingship passed away the idea was transferred to the fire of the state in the Prytaneion, with which the fortune of the state might be held to be inextricably connected. It may be granted that the purpose of maintaining the fire was religious from the start, but the motive had, it seems probable, nothing to do with any idea of the connexion of the chiefs soul with the fire ; rather the fire as a most

important x .and ever valuable deity was to be preserved alight if possible byevery sacrificer, an idea which naturally enough with civic organization results in the fires of the Prytaneia and the cult of Vesta at Rome. 

The nature of such deities as Hestia and Vesta is often misunderstood bystudents of Greek and Roman religion, who are accustomed to reckon personality in terms of clear anthropomorphism, and who fail to appreciate 

that the conceptionof fire as living and active is in essence a personalcon ception. This error, fostered by the fact that what we know of old Romanreligion is only on its formal side, has led to the view2 that early Romanreligion could not be nature worship of the type usually attributed to Indo 

Europeans. The conclusion obviously rests on the wholly erroneous view that Indo-European worship was that of personifications of nature forces ; it wasthe worship of nature as animate, and what is animate is not impersonal. The theory that Roman or any other religion developed from the indeter minate conceptionof an impersonalforce ascribes to early man the power of framing a complex conception which is wholly implausible.It is absurd to suppose that the daily reverence paidin the household to the flame of Vesta into which a morsel of salted cake was thrown was not paid to a personal deity, 

although she was not represented by an image. The reason for this paucity of representation in Rome as in Greece was precisely the same as in Greece ; the living flame is the present deity, and to a people to whom this was a living belief the idea of making an image would have appearedidle. The formalism 

of the Indigitamentais the result of priestly ingenuity,3 not primitive belief, and all our knowledge of Roman religionis obscured by the lateness of our records and the effect of Greek ideas. It is characteristic of the tendency to treat Roman religion as more abstract than it really was that efforts are madeto explain away the facts recorded of the connexion of the wolf and the wood pecker with Mars as representing a late development, and to deny the paternity of Jupiter4 and the maternity of Earth, and to make even sunworship a borrowing.6 

F. CREMATION AND BURIAL 

The view that cremation was a distinctively Indo-European form of dis posal of the dead cannot be supported by any evidence of value. There is abundant proof that burial is at least as ancient a method, and, indeed, it is 

possible to hold that it was Indo-European,while burning was introduced after that period among the different peopleseither independentlyor byborrowing. The Vedic evidence, as has been shown, provesthat burial wasearly ; Herodotos 6 ascribes the usage to the Persians, while the Magoi, possibly by religious conservatism, preservedthe method of exposure ; burial he also 1 Learned Brahmans, village headmen, and Indo-Iranian sun worship is incapable

assigns to the Iranian Scythians.1 In the case of Greece the existence of a pre-Hellenic population which practisedburial renders the evidence2specially obscure, but it is important that in the earliest Athenian cemeteries in the 4dipylon*graves of the geometric periodof art cremation is very rare. Theevidence from Italy shows burials preceding cremations in the oldest cemeteries, and even if the peopleof the terremare, perhaps in part the ancestors of the Latins, were addicted to burning,3 it is impossible to assumethat burial* was in Italy derived from the non-Indo-European population. 

The laws of the Ten Tables4 forbade the burial or burning of a dead manwithin the city, and there is a remarkable provision in an ojd law of the regal period which provides for the saving of the embryo in the case of the burial of a pregnant woman.5 That burial was the more ancient custom is suggested strongly by the fact that conservative families like the Cornelii persisted in burying their dead until the time of the Dictator Sulla, whose cremation wasdictated by political reasons. Archaeological evidence in the lands held bythe Slavs, Teutons, and Celts establishes the priority of burial, and it is not plausible to suppose that the appearanceof burning there meant the advent of a new race. Cremation is recorded for the Celts by Caesar6 and the Hallstatt cemetery ; for the Teutons by Tacitus,7 and later evidence establishes it for the Slavs and Lithuanians. All the evidence, therefore, is compatible with the view that burning was a rite introduced, comparatively late in some cases, in the separate life of the Indo-European peoples. 

It is, however, extremely difficult to arrive at any theory establishing the period when or the place whence the new practice came to be disseminated. The theory of Ridgeway8 which makes the Celts protagonists in the matter is most implausible in the form in which he has stated it, and there is no con clusive reason to assume that the use must have been started by one only of the Indo-European peoples. Whether the motive of burning was due to a change in the aspectin which men regarded the dead, or arose from practical considerations, such as those affecting the advance of a people who could not continue to bury their dead and to cherish them in their ancestral homes, there is no special reason to suppose that only one Indo-European people invented it. The Greeks invading Hellas, and the Indians invading India, may havebeen moved by similar motives independently, or again in one case one, in another yet a different, motive may have been operative, and it is not neces sary to seek any theory which will explainall cases. Borrowing from any non Indo-European source is implausible,in the absence of any clear evidence of the prevalence of the rite among peoples by whom the Indo-Europeans could have been influenced.

628 Appendix F   

The motives which may have influenced burning are many, apart from the necessities or convenience of invaders. The removal of a dangerous object is obviously one possibility ; the view that it was intended to facilitate the celestial existence of the soul by riddingit of the encumbrance of the bodyhas been strongly supported,1 but, as we have seen, is not borne out by anyVedic evidence. Paton2adopts the suggestionof E. Meyer3 that cremation existed in Indo-European times alongside with burial, but that it was performed originally only in the case of heroes, chiefs or kings, who were believed to partake of the divine nature and, therefore, were returned by fire to the celestial regions. In support of this is adduced the fact that in Egypt4 the ideas of the future of the king gradually became appliedto the ordinary people, as did cremation in Greece. But the evidence for this distinction is inadequate ; in India there is nothing of the kind, the fact that children under two years of age were not cremated, adduced by Paton, is irrelevant, for ascetics shared the same fate, and there is no trace of the caste differen tiation in this regard which would be necessary on the theoryof a distinction based on an aristocratic practice.It is not the case that the distinction can be seen in Homer,5 and the evidence of Caesar and Tacitus regarding the Celts and the Teutons says nothing of a distinction between the treatment of the great and the mere clansmen. 

Definite proof of the Indo-European character of burial of the dead wouldbe afforded if it were possible to acceptas proved Peake's6 identification of them with the Kurgan peopleof the steppes cast of the Dnieper, whocertainly buried their dead in a contracted position, the skeletons found being thickly covered with red ochre, a custom which is attested as early as Aurig nacian times. The evidence, as has been mentioned, for this theory is

inadequate to establish it, but it may be noted that the Vedic Indians appear to have agreed with these peoplein their tendency to simplicity and economyin regard to the offerings deposited with the dead, for the Vedic offerings are, as we have seen, strictly limited in quantity and quality. The contracted position of the dead may have been induced by the desire to reproduce the character of a foetus, awaiting new birth in the world to come, and the idea of rebirth as an embryo is conspicuous in the Vedic Diksa ceremonial. Thebarrow mqy be compared with the Vedic memorial mound.1 It might further be conjectured that the use of burning was influenced by the practice of the neighbouring peoples of Tripolye culture2 who regularly, if not invariably 

burned their dead. But we have no real means of arriving at any valid con clusion. 

G. THE DRAVIDIAN ELEMENT IN INDIAN THOUGHT

The desire to prove that Dravidian or pre-Dravidian peoplesaffected deeply Vedic thought and life is natural, and is supported by the generally accepted view that the population of India is predominantly Dravidian or at least of non-Indo-European origin. It is true, however, that in the absence 

of any real certainty of the physical characteristics of the Indo-Europeans this belief cannot be made the subject of strict proof. Assuming, however, the validity of the doctrine, there remains the question whether the invaders wereessentially responsible for the Vedic religion and philosophy, imposing a superior culture on inferior races, or whether the process as regards culture wasreversed ; instances of analogical cases can be easily adduced.8 Here again, however, we must remember that we have no satisfactory evidence of the relative numbers of the invaders and the earlier settlers ; we are left in this matter wholly to conjecture. 

The best case that can be made out for the Indo-European character of Vedic religion or philosophy depends on comparison"witET the aciuevements of other Indo-European peoples, and, of course, in this case we are met with the problem to what extent these religions and philosophies were Indo-European

in character, or on the contrary represent elements borrowed by the invaders from the countries they occupied. Thus, for instance, we have Sir A. Evans' suggestion4 that the Homeric epic embodies largely traditions of the pre Hellenic Minoans, though the language is Indo-European, and, even if wedismiss the suggestionas not very plausible, we are not in a position to disprove it definitely by the evidence available. More important is the close similarity of many Indian and Iranian ideas, as developed by Julius von Negclein in his Weltanscluiuung des indogermanischen Asiens, but it may be noted even here that, as that work shows, many of the important ideas of Aryan belief can beparalleled among other races. 

On the other hand, we must admit that when we come to definite attempts to prove Dravidian influence on Vedic religion or philosophy we are in the region of conjecture. The absence of any really early Dravidian evidence as to 1 This is not to be high nor too large,*Minns, op. cit. t pp. 183 ft*. ; Peake, op. cit.,

culture deprives us of any assured knowledge of pre-Indo-Europeanconditions such as would enable us effectively to gauge Dravidian influences in Vedic religion or philosophy. This leads to the necessity of relying on conjectures, 

of which many may be easily shown to have no sound foundation, or at mostto be mere possibilities. Wemay, of course, agcegtjUidx possibilitiesif we like, but in doing so we cease to be4&dic*&l anc^ arrive merely at subjective judge ments which have no lasting value. 

It must be noted that the Dravidians are not allowed the crcdit.of origina lity by such writers as Elliot Smith,1 and Fleure, who insist instead on oversea and overland influences from Mesopotamia and Egypt as settling the course of Dravidian culture, though the evidence for this influence in the third millen nium B. c. and much later is entirely speculative, depending on the existence of megaliths alleged to be connected with metallic deposits, and on the certainly unproved theory of the dissemination of this mode of building by a particular race, moved by peculiar religious views, who sought life-giving substances. The structures raised on this basis by Elliot Smith and Perry seems to meentirely unfounded and in every respect implausible, nor is there muchprobability of their receiving general endorsement by competent critics. It is, however, needless here to discuss their views, and Slater,2 quite justly, lays more stress than his authorities on the independent power of the Dravidians to develop their culture. Moreover he rejects,3very plausibly, the doctrine that the Dravidians represent the admixture of Mediterranean bearers of heliolithic culture with pre-Dravidiansto form the Dravidian race, and his position treats the Dravidians as immigrants from the north-west who passed through Babylonia before the Sumerians were practising agriculturethere. 

Slater 4 contends that there is evidence to provethe superiority of the Dravidians in culture, ascribing to them the possessionof castles, cities, wealth, luxury, the use of magic, superiorarchitectural skill, and ability to restore the dead to life. He holds that they possessed a priest-magicianclan or caste 

such as did not exist among the Aryans. Unfortunately he adduces noevidence for these assertions beyond the unscientific opinions of Mr. C. F. Oldham,5 and a couple of even less plausible conjectures, and it is sufficient to observe that there is nothing whatever to induce us to believe in the superiority of the culture of the Dravidians or the Mun<}a-speaking tribes, and that on the contrary the evidence points rather in the oppositedirection. 

It is further held6 that caste is Dravidian, the Brahmans being the product of the mingling of the bringers of the heliolithic culture from Egyptwith the Dravidians. They achieved domination over the Dravidians, and, when the Aryans entered India, showing superior prowess,as users of horses, the Brahmans saw the wisdom of adoptingthe allegedlyeasier language which the masters spoke, and became the guardians and exponentsof the Vedas, until finally they succeeded in imposingthemselves as leaders of the Aryans who were Dravidized in culture. It is important to note that on this theory the Rigveda is left to the Aryans during the period when they werein the full flush of their conquests.It is difficult to reconcile this with the assertion that Visnu is certainly not an Aryan god, since he most unmistakably

exists in the Rigveda, which also knows Rudra, who is in part the prototype of iva, also asserted to be not Aryan. 

The doctrine of the Egypto-Dravidian origin of caste is supported by the following arguments. (1 ) It is admitted that the Brahmans of the south claim Aryan descent and that they are differentiated from the bulk of the Dravidian population in facial appearance, complexion, and intellectual habit ; but the justice of the claim to Aryan connexion is discounted on the score that it maybe explained on the Egyptian hypothesis. This contention proves nothing, and leaves the traditional view unaffected. (2) It is alleged that the bearers of the heliolithic culture claimed divinity and established in Indonesia and

elsewhere ruling classes claiming divine descent, while the traditional Brahmantheory is that every Brahman is a god. The allegedfacts are wholly problema tical ; the divinity of rulers when it exists can be traced to various ethnic causes, and the claims of the Brahmans are easily explicable without going beyond the Aryans.1(3) The carriers of the heliolithic culture are asserted to have been worshippers of the sun and the serpent ; the Nambudiris, whoare specially conservative, worship the cobras in Nayar households, andBrahman was a solar deity. The Brahmans of the Rigveda, however, donot worship cobras, and do not know a god Brahman. (4) The sacred cord of the Brahman is of cotton2 which indicates an original association of the caste with cotton spinning, which certainly was noartof the Vedic Aryans. This, it is held, is a clear indication of the descent ofBraKmans from foreigners who earned the gratitude and homage of the people of India by teaching themtospjn and weave. The argument is clearly without value, and Slater himself admits that "India itself was the home of the art of spinning and weavingcotton primarily tree cotton, so that it is wholly needless to look to Egyp tians of problematic reality. Moreover, it will be seen that the account of the origin of caste accepted by Slater is in effect merely a transfer to an Egyptianelement of the tendency to stress racial distinctions, which together with occupation he believes to explain caste. A final complication introduced bySlater is his view that when they achieved supremacy the Brahmans becamelargely Aryanizcd in blood, because they aimed at securing the fairest wives. 

Finally may be noted the argument which ascribes special potency in magic to the Dravidians, including the power of raising the dead, on the strength of'the Vedas '.3 No such statement, of course, has any Vedic authority.4 

Nothing more substantial is adduced by Mr. G. W. Brown in his examina tion of the sources of Indian philosophy.5 He claims that animism is Dravi dian, and that in it Jainism and Buddhism show closer adherence to Dravidian ideas, rejecting the new Aryan gods. The Aryans must have learned in India to worship new trees like the peepal and banyan, the peafowl, the serpent, the monkey, various species of grass, and sacred places innumerable, from their predecessors, to whom also is due the doctrine of transmigration with its corollary ofrelease. But here again we have nothing ofsubstantialimportance ; we have no right to hold that animistic or animatistic ideas were un-Aryan ; Roman religion for instance is permeated by them, and Greek has relics of

them.1 Transmigration again is recorded as a Druid belief,2 and was adopted in Greece, apparently from Thrace, andindependently of India. The moreconcrete suggestion that the terms Samkhyaand Xoga, and even Upanisad are really derived from Dravidian names is clearly illegitimate in the absence of any difficulty of explaining satisfactorily the terms as Aryan contributions. For asceticism and caste as Dravidian no proof is even attempted.3 

An effort to render probable pre-Dravidianinfluence on Vedic civilization and religion has recently been made by Professor S. Levi,4 who revives the hint of Barth 6 that the Atharvan tdbuva may really be derived from the taboo of the Australians and Polynesians, and refers also to Mr. J. Hornell's conclusions,6 from the facts regarding Indian boats, of Polynesian influence, and even of a Polynesian invasion, the latter in Dravidian times, whichintroduced the coco-nut palm into India. Levi's evidence is based on the existence of pairs or triads of ethnic names, appliedto neighbouring peoples, which are differentiated by an initial preformant, a usage neither Indo-European nor Dravidian. Thus the Atharvaveda Pariista knows of Tosala as well as Kosala, a union found later in the Puranas and textbooks of rhetoric, while A?oka records Tosall, the name of which Levi would evenidentify with Dhauli. Anga is found in the Atharvaveda, while with VafLga it appears from the epic onwards, usuallyin close association with Kalinga. For the latter again we have a parallelin the quite late7 name of the Telegu country Tiliiiga, Trilinga, Tailinga, &c., whose antiquity, however, maybe supported by Trilingon or Triglyptonin Ptolemy's geography.8 Levi compares also the Bhulingas, known to Pliny and Ptolemy and the Ganapatha, who appear to have been a part of the Salvas,9though the epic ignores them. Both epics, however, have the combination Utkala with Mekala (with the variant Melaka). We have also Udrade9a, Orissa, which goes back to anU<Ja to be recognizedin Manu,10 for which Unda is a variant ; comparable are the Puncjras, and even the Mun<Jas. The Pulindas are known from the Aitareya Brahmana onwards ; the Brhatkatha^lokasamgrahanrepresents them in terms which suggest that they were small and black, like the pre Dravidians,12 and practised totemism. The epic mentions with them the Kulindas who may more properly have been Kalindas, as the name, Kalindi, of the Yamuna suggests, and another variant is Kunindas.13 The Munclalanguages permitthe use of consonants as prefixes and the infixation of a nasal in certain cases between the prefix and the root, facts which wouldexplain these variants, and which suggest that in the ultimate issue Utkalais U<Jra, differentiated by the infixation of a &, and Mekala Murida.

The Dravidian Element in Indian Thought 633may be noted also the parallelism of Takkola as a place-name and the plant name Kakkola, and of ksumd (k$auma) and umd (aumlna, umya) as the nameof linen. The element -linga in some of these names suggests comparisonwith Lanka as denoting4 island ', appliedin both the Mahanadi and Godavariregions,1 though P. Schmidt2 has suggestedfor Kalinga comparisonwith the Nicobar word kaldn, sea-eagle, which would suggest that the ethnic nameswere of totemic origin. In the Indian archipelago names such as Karmaraiiga, Kamaranga, Tamralinga, suggest that in Kamarupa and Tamraliptiin its varied forms we have variants of a pre-Dravidian word. Kam again reappears probably in Kamboja, which is in its turn equated with Kapi$a, both imperfect representations of an old form. Without a prefix we have Bhoja, the aspirate of which is due to contamination with the root bhujof Sanskrit. The pairs of names suggest certain conclusions as to the social and political importance of a people who must have created political unities of considerable extent, so firmly connected with the real life of the country that they have persisted through thousands of yearsto the present day.   

This evidence, unfortunately, hardly carries us any farther towardsascertaining the amount of pre-Dravidianinfluence on Vedic civilization, and it must be added that much of it seems of very dubious value. Theevidence that Tilifiga was an early form is negligible ; Ptolemy has already Trilinga before him and he localizes the placein Arakan. Utkala may beUcjra, but obviously,if we can operate with such names, we can establish anything we like ; similarly with Kamarupa and Tamralipti. The attemptto deduce from Yaska3 that he classed the Bhojas, of whom the Kambojaswere a branch, as different from the Aryas appears hardly justifiable, bhoja in the passage cited having probably the sense4enjoying ', and not anethnic significance, and the one thing certain about that peopleis that they were reckoned by Yaska as using a language closely akin to that of the Aryas. Clearly a very necessary proof of the thesis is still lacking, plausible etymologies from Austric languages, and these are clearly by no meanseasy to find, for Lcvi rejects the one suggested, prima facie with plausibility, for Kalinga. If it were true that tdbuva was taboo, it would seem natural to expect that even the modern languages which are our chief means of investigating Austric language construction should show in other wordssimilar conservatism of form. But in point of form nothing very satisfactory can be made out of the comparisons already, very ingeniously, made byPrzyluski.4 The conditions under which the investigation has to be conductedperhaps fatally preclude the adduction of really convincing cases, at any rate where Vedic words are concerned. We may readily believe in pre-Dravidian language and religion or even political organizationas affecting the samephenomena among the Vedic peoples, but we still lack strict proof. An effort to determine the characteristics of the pre-Dravidians has beenmade by Professor Giuffrida Ruggcri,6 who holds that India was successively 1 Tibetan glin ; Pliny, N.II. vi. 18, has his assertion that the Kambojas used

The pre-Dravidians, on his view, were numerically preponder ant, as held by Chanda, but the Dravidians imposed their language on large bodies of them, though the Mu$<Ja languages persisted. The Dravidians were mesorrhine as opposed to the pre-Dravidian platyrrhines, the NisSdas of Vedic texts, the*noseless' enemies of the Rigveda. Similarly he assumesthat the pre-Dravidians imposed their language on the Negritos, thus accounting for the fact that the speeches kindred to the Muncja are spoken bytribes of Negrito as well as of pre-Dravidian type.1 It must be admitted, however, that despite the ingenuityof this reconstruction evidence for it of any decisive character is wholly lacking, as it is based on recent anthropo metrical data, whence conjectures are made for events of some four thousandyears ago.2 

H. PYTHAGORAS AND PARMENIDES 

U. von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff3 holds that in the doctrine of Philolaos the five bodies in the sphairaare the four elements, which compose it, with as fifth 6 ras ox/>at>a<?6A.Ko's in the sense of that which gives the sphairaits form, the nature of that something being only vaguelyfelt ; in the TimaiosPlato makes the world-soul perform an analogous function. He insists4 that it is to Aristotle we must look for the conceptionof the ether as a fifth element, for he evidently deliberately claims this as his own invention. Theassertion of Xenokratcs6 which ascribes the doctrine to Plato he explainseither as referring to a casual adoptionof the idea by Plato, which he did not carry farther, or to his accepting an innovation of Aristotle's. Doubtless ascription to Plato or Aristotle of the precise form of the doctrine is legitimate, butthere is force in the view of Rostagni that already in the early Pythagoreanview, if we accept the traditional accounts, the basis of the doctrine existed. The fifth element is the Trepuxov which is described also as the other as well as the aTTctpoi/ TTvtv/xa, while on the immaterial side we have the world spirit as the power which binds together the mass. In any event there is no close 1 W. Schmidt, Die Mon-Khmer-Vdlkcr guages. But we have no proof of the

Frank,1 as against Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, insists that in the fragmentof Philolaos there is a reference to the twofold doctrine of the five regular bodies and their correspondence with the five elements, but he holds that this is merely one of many proofs that the ascription of the fragment to Philolaos is a mere error. He points outa that the natural deduction to be made from

Plato's writings is that both the doctrine of the irrational and the discovery of the five figures were invented shortly before the time when he accepted them, apparently by Theaitetos. He denies to the real Pythagoras the mathematical achievements claimed for him, but ignored by Xenophanes,

Herakleitos, Empedokles, and Herodotos,8placing them in the Platonic age, while he traces the mathematical philosophyof the Pythagoreans to an effort to reconcile the doctrines of Anaxagoras and Demokritos, pointing out that their views are inconceivable before Anaxagoras (c. 460-430 B.C.) hadclearly distinguished the ideas of quality and quantity, and first Protagoras and then Demokritos (c. 430 u. c.) had established the doctrine of the sub jectivity of sense qualities. The Pythagorean view was thus one of pointsas monads, related to the dynamic conception of matter in Anaxagoras and the materialistic atomism of Demokritos as was the Monadologia physica of Kant's youth to the dynamic conception of matter in Leibnitz and the atomism of Huyghens and Newton. Without necessarily accepting the wholeof Frank's contentions, and in particular the view that Speusipposis the real author of the Philolaos fragments, it is clear that we cannot safely accord to Pythagoras himself credit for his mathematical discoveries, and thus oneimportant ground for the alleged derivation of his views from India disappears. 

Frank, who candidly recognizes4 the influence of Egypt on the beginnings of Greek mathematics and derives5 thence the Greek knowledge of the planets which, of course, were ccrtainlvnot borrowed from India insists6 that the essential turning point Fn GreeR tKbught came with the Persian war, after which Greece broke free from connexion with the generaloriental tendency of thought, and Anaxagoras formulated the fundamental principle of the distinction between our subjective world and reality, as it appearsto an ideal spectator, in his doctrine of optics. In the Chandogya Upanisad7 we find the assertion that all things can be resolved into one or other of three elements, but no proof is attempted, and the difference is indicative of the distance which separates Greek and Indian trends of thought. Others again tend to argue that Iranian ideas, partly themselves of Babylonian origin, were influential 8 on early Greek thought as well as later,8 but, whatever the value of these views, they do not support any direct, nor probably any indirect, influence of India on Greece.*"""" " The probabilityof parallelismas regards the developmentof the doctrine

of transmigration is shown by the fact that Plato in the Lawsl treats the idea as pre-Pythagorean and illustrates one motive creatingit in the view that the murderer of a father or mother must be reborn to endure in his own person the punishment of a similar fate. It is no more surprising that such an idea should be found independently in two countries than that the Jaiminiya Brahmana 2 should record as a symptom of divinely induced madness the action of a priest in cuttingoff the heads of his father's cattle, even as Aias shows his dementia by his onslaught on his kinc. The tale of Aias^was known

to the Little Iliad,* and was probably current by 700 B. c., far too early to permit of borrowing. For Greece Wilamowitz-Moellendorff4 finds the cause of the doctrine in the succession of generations, the grandson bearing the grandfather's name and reproducing him, while Rostagni6 insists on the fact 

that the early mind, when it reflects, is unable to conceive of anything utterly perishing or coming into being from nothing, and thus is induced to accept transmigration.It is surprising that Gomperz,6 who recognizes 

this fact, should insist on deriving the Greek view from India. His view is evidently based in part on inaccurate information, as in the case of his 

contention that'the formulae which summarize the whole of the"circle and wheel"of birth are likewise the same in both'Pythagorean and Indian belief. Similarly he finds7 a curious parallel between the appearance of the doctrine of transmigration shortly before the belief of Parmenides in the one reality, as compared with the first records of transmigration in India as occurring not long before the doctrine of the eternal one ; this suggestion of Oldenbcrg 8is not supported by the facts, which suggest that the order in time of the doctrines was rather the reverse. Gomperz admits, however, the radical difference between the Greek outlook as scientific as well as religious, and the Indian as mainly religious. A most strikingillustration of 

the divergence is furnished by the doctrine of the Pythagoreans recorded byAristotle 9explaining how souls were always available to enter new bodies when these came into being. They found the explanationin the existence of particles ofdustinthe sunlight, which they conceived to be living souls, n75T*ifHnTSE*rlaT^ of fine matter, a conception which maintained itself as late as the Neo-Platonists10 in one aspectof the doctrine of Tn/cfyiu. 

The parallel drawn by Garbc between the doctrine of the Upanisads and that of Parmenides is, of course, largely discounted, if we accept the view that Parmenides was essentially not the father of idealism but of materialism, as claimed by Burnet,11 who with Zeller12 denies to Parmenides the assertion of the identity of thought and being which is attributed to him by Garbe. Burnet 13 also further differentiates Parmenides from the doctrine of the Upanisads by denying that the second part of his poem is intended as an exposition of appearances as opposed to reality in the sense that Parmenides admitted in some degree that appearances existed. On his view, as on that of Diels, this part of the poem merely deals with opinionsof others, which are necessarily false, those others being, as he thinks, Pythagoreans, not, as in Diels's view, followers of Herakleitos.

both by Gomperzl and Wilamowitz,2 and it must be regarded as far fromsatisfactorily made out,8 while the treatment by Plato of Parmenides is inconsistent with the view that he was really a mere materialist. Theanalogy of Spinozacited by Gomperz is perhapsthe most enlightening ; the one is material but also it is spiritual ;'It is universal matter and universal spirit at once, but the matter is sterile because capable of no expansion andthe spirit powerless because capable of no action.' Gomperz, however, is clearly erroneous in comparingthe Vedanta philosophy, which in no formdevelops this precise doctrine: 

K. Reinhardt,4again, insists that Parmenides admits no distinction between thinking and being,6 but in his doctrine of opinion he aims, not at describing any merely apparent reality, but at the world as it necessarily presents itself to man, a world in which being and not-being stand side by

side commingled, although he has no means of explainingtheir union, whencearises this empirical universe, save by hinting (pop^a* yapKarsOivro ovo yv^a^ovofjA^tv) that it is conventional as opposed to the one reality. Parmenides, onthis view, in lieu of being essentially a materialist, was rather a logician, who,however, had not reached the stage when thought could be held to be other thanreality. Like Frank, Reinhardt6rejects the idea of any connexion betweenParmenides and the Pythagoreans ; nor indeed is there any real ground for this suggestion, least of all for the conception of Burnet that Parmenideswas a Pythagorean who was renouncing the false doctrines of his youth. 

The views of Parmenides, therefore, must be deemed a parallel of interest to Indian thought, but not derived from India. In this regard interest also attaches to his treatment of the ideas of being, not-being, and being andnot-being, which is reiterated in Gorgias,7 and presents a certain similarity, but also in its dialectic an instructive contrast, to the treatment of the issue in the Chandogya Upanisad.8
