title = "05 The Nature of the Absolute"

+++

The Upanisads are essentially concerned with the endeavour to describe the nature of the absolute, and the rich abundance of attempts to succeed in this end, proved by the references to conflicting theories in the Upanisads, is clear proof of the busy mental activity of the period. From the earliest Upanisad we have, the view is clear that there is a unity, that it is necessary further to grasp the nature of that unity, and that the proper names of the unity are either the Brahman or the Atman. The two ideas whose history we have seen in the Brahmanas are used constantly in alternation with each other. It is clear that they must have been felt to be practically akin. 

Many of these attempts were, it is clear, of little worth: Bālāki Gārgya in

The Nature of the Absolute

his interview with AjataŚatru puts forward twelve 1 or sixteen views of the nature of the absolute. They are all of the same type, the soul in the sun, the moon, lightning, ether, fire, water, the person in a mirror, the sound that follows one as he goes, the person in the quarters, the shadow, the person in the body, &c., to which the king opposes in reply the conception of that whence the breaths proceed, and on which the worlds, gods, and men depend. Other suggestions made by Śakalya 2 which treat breath, love, forms, ether, &c., as the basis of the absolute are refuted by Yajnavalkya, who also rejects the suggestions of speech, the breath, the eye, the ear, mind, and the heart laid before him by Janaka as doctrines enunciated on this head. Yajnavalkya shows that these things are only the basis of the attributes of the divine unity, and that it is necessary to go behind the mere attributes or their manifestation, which can only be done by recognizing the essential identity of the absolute and our own spirit. The Brahmans who with Uddālaka are instructed by AŚvapati Kaikeya are supporters of the claims of heaven, sun, wind, ether, water, and earth as the absolute unity, there conceived as the Atman VaiŚvanara, an idea borrowed from the Agni VaiŚvānara which forms the subject of discussion in the secret doctrine of the fire in the Śatapatha Brahmana. The king, on his part, insists that the Atman must be within, not an external object. A much longer and more elaborate series of imperfect views is represented in the instruction of Narada by Sanatkumāra, where from name the advance is made through speech, mind, conception or judgement (samkalpa), thought, intuition (dhyāna), knowledge (vijñāna), force, food (i.e. earth), water, heat, ether, memory, and longing (aŚā), to the breath which is the individual soul, and finally to the great one, Bhuman, which comprehends all, fills space, and is identical with the principle of egoism, Ahamkāra, and the self, Atman, in man. The transition from the individual to the great one is made thus: truth depends on knowledge, this on thought (mati), this on faith, this on concentration (niḥṣṭhā), this on productive power, this on pleasure, which exists in the unlimited.

More important than these theories are others: Indra and the demon Virocana went to Prajapati for instruction: he first describes the Atman as the body, a view thought adequate by Virocana, who is the prototype of all men who merely see in the body the hope of immortality, and, therefore, deck it out on death with gay raiment. Prajapati then explains the self as the spirit in dreams, but Indra is not satisfied, since the spirit is still in this condition opposed to a world beyond itself. Prajapati then propounds the self in dreamless sleep, where there is no distinction of subject and object, which he explains as not the annihilation of the self, but its entry upon the fullest 1 BAU. ii. 1; KU. iv.

light in identification with the absolute. With this view must be compared a more developed one expressed in the Taittiriya Upanisad,1 where there are distinguished five Atmans; the first is the annamaya, which corresponds to the body; then the pranamaya, which corresponds to the life of the breaths or vital airs; the manomaya, the self of the mind, which here clearly means the activity of the self as conscious will in such actions as sacrifice and study; the vijñānamaya, in which for sacrifice is substituted knowledge and worship of the deity in that manner; and finally the anandamaya, that of joy before whom words and thought recoil, not finding him. This last self is not an object of knowledge, and hence it is described as not real-empirically, as unconscious and unutterable. In it is bliss, which is broken by the belief in any difference between the self and it. 

2 

Other efforts are made to realize the Atman by a process of examination of the merits of the different claimants. Thus we have the account of the rivalry of the senses foreshadowed in the Brāhmaṇas carried out in detail. The breath is the victor over speech, the eye, the ear, and mind, because when all the others go from the body still it is left animated, and from another point of view breath alone is able in the conflict of the gods, the senses, and the demons to overthrow the demons.3 Another version 4 adds to the other powers the cosmical equivalents, and ranges speech, eye, car and breath against one another, and fire, sun, moon, and wind against one another; in each case the result is the victory of breath and wind. In the Kausitaki Upanisad, following the Aitareya Brahmana, the cosmic divinities fire, sun, moon, lightning, and the psychic divinities, speech, eye, ear, mind, enter into the wind and the breath respectively. The same idea occurs in an earlier version of the Śatapatha Brahmana: in sleep speech enters the breath, and so with eye, mind, ear, and correspondingly with fire, sun, moon, and the quarters in their relation to the wind. Hence we frequently find that the breath is set up as an idea of the Brahman, but merely to be rejected as inadequate.

Still more clearly inadequate are the identifications of Brahman with mind," which as in the Brahmaṇas never achieves a decisive place of importance, and with more material concepts, such as the sun and as the ether. The sun is interesting, as it is clear that efforts were madeas in Egypt in the reform of Akhenaten-to penetrate beyond the mere physical sun to the man in the sun, with whom the dying man declares his identity.10 The real

relation to the sun is, however, declared to be something above that,1 and similarly against the conception of the absolute as there is set the view that the absolute is in the ether, and is the controller of the ether.2 

Another set of conceptions is rather different: they are not so much real efforts to explain the absolute as merely to bring it into contact with the sacrifice it was clearly the most natural thing in the world for the various schools, which were contemporary with the development of the Brahman, to apply to the chief concepts of their special branch of Vedic literature the idea of identification with the absolute. Thus the schools of the Rigveda fixed upon the Uktha,3 the litany, especially that of the Mahavrata ceremony as the absolute, the Samaveda schools chose the Saman and in special the Udgitha," and the schools of the Yajurveda the horse 5 offered at the sacrifice. Much more common is the view that by the mystic syllable, Om, originally no more perhaps than a formal word of assent, the Brahman is denoted." 

7 

A more advanced conception is to be found in the Aitareya Aranyaka which uses the old conception of breath, but identifies with it Prajñā, 'intellect'. On intellect the whole world is based, it is guided by intellect, and knowledge is the absolute. The same view is expressed in the Kauṣitaki Upanisad 8 where the identity of breath and intellect is asserted absolutely, but also later on is more precisely investigated: it shows that the objects of sense depend on the organs of sense, and the latter are dependent in turn on intellect, but it still adheres to the identification of the two. The Chandogya itself identifies breath, ether, and bliss. The breath, therefore, still here and there appears with its claim to be the Atman, but it is also now and then made dependent on it, or even the shadow of it. 

9 

But the nature of the Brahman is not intellect alone: it is also bliss and reality, and these ideas are here and there already united as in the later Upanisads, though the enumeration of the triad as the actual character of the Brahman is not actually found in the early Upanisads. In its place the Taittiriya once presents the Brahman as being (sat), thought (cit), and eternity, where ananta, ' eternity', stands probably in error for the Ananda, ' bliss', of the later triad. As being the Brahman, it is at once being and notbeing the old duplication of the Rigveda,10 which asserts that at first there was neither being nor not-being is recognized here and there, but in the definite sense that, as not-being, the absolute is not empirical being, and that as being it is also not empirical being, so that the question is one of terminology

alone and is decided in favour of the appellation being. Much more important is the attribute of thought, which is asserted repeatedly in the doctrine of Yajnavalkya." He there asserts that the hearer, the seer, the understander, the knower, are all unknown: they are the soul within, which again is in essence the divine, for all else than it is liable to suffering. In this subject of knowledge ether or space is interwoven it is the meeting-place of all sounds, smells, sights, and other experiences. The different organs-and their functions-are only names for the one subject. In his conversation with Janaka, the philosopher traces the Atman as the knowing subject, which persists without change through the stages of waking, dreaming, deep sleep, death, transmigration, and final deliverance of the soul. The spirit in the waking state beholds the good and the evil of the world, but it is not moved by it, since as subject it is really incapable of affection in the state of dreaming it builds up its own world, and in deep dreamless sleep, wrapped round by the intellectual self, it has no consciousness of objects, and yet is not unconscious. The self is compared to a lump of salt which has no inner or outer aspects it is simply a single unit, and so consciousness has no inner and outer side, and is one unity alone. The Brahman is also the light of lights, and through it alone is there any light in the universe. For the wise man there is perpetual and abiding light, and this idea in the later Upanisads appears in a variety of metaphors such as the day of Brahman which is eternal.

The conception of the self as essentially consciousness is not, however, confined to Yajnavalkya: the same view is expressed, in words which may be dependent on the Bṛhadaraṇyaka, in the Chandogya, and the Aitareya and the Kausitaki texts as we have seen emphasize the same conception under the view that the self is intellect. In neither case, however, need we assume dependence on Yajnavalkya, for unlike the case of the Chandogya the line of argument differs, and is, in the later case directly, and in the former indirectly, linked with the conception of the self as breath, which does not appear in the development of the ideas of Yajnavalkya. 

The nature of the absolute as bliss is also asserted by Yajnavalkya," who brings the conception into the closest relation with his idea of its nature. The bliss which he contemplates is that of the man in dreamless sleep, when the consciousness of individuality is lost, and when the self, therefore, is above

? The unit of bliss is that of a happy man in this world; that in the Fathers' world is ten times greater; that of the

all pain and grief and enjoys pure bliss, whence it is a simple step to the equation of the absolute and bliss. Nor is there much doubt that here again the Chandogya1 depends on the Bṛhadaraṇyaka, when it enunciates the doctrine of the absolute as ether, breath, and joy under the mystic name of Kha. The Kauṣitaki 3 also seems to borrow from the Bṛhadaraṇyaka, and the whole idea is further developed in the Taittiriya,4 in the Anandavalli. There special stress is laid on the error of seeking to find any division of subject and object in bliss: that would create division and would admit the idea of fear, which can arise only from division. The dependence on the Bṛhadaranyaka of this doctrine is borne out by the relation of the anandamaya self to the vijñānamaya: in the former text they are the same idea, and, therefore, the conscious self is the highest, there being no difference of subject and object in it the Taittiriya refines by making the vijñanamaya still have the distinction of subject and object, and then erecting the anandamaya above it in rank. It is characteristic of the growth of these distinctions that, later on," the anandamaya itself became regarded as a mere sheath (koŚa) in which the self or the Brahman resided. 

The other side of this exaltation of the bliss of the absolute is of course the view that all the world is misery, but the pessimism of the Upanisads is moderate we hear of the miseries of old age and death or disease, and trouble which the knowledge of the absolute removes, but the growth of the spirit of pessimism is only to be traced in Upanisads of the quite late class. 

7 

But, despite the giving to the absolute of these three attributes or characteristics, Yajnavalkya returns constantly to the fact that they are not to be taken in the empirical sense, and that, therefore, our knowledge of the absolute is non-existent. (The most drastic expression for this view is the formula neti neti, not so, not so ', which denies to the absolute any and every attempt to define it in terms of ordinary knowledge) Its existence is a transcendental reality, which is essentially from the empírical point of view a nonentity; its consciousness involves the essential fusion of subject and object, and the transcendence of their diversity, although the phraseology of the Upanisads always treats the Atman as subject, and, therefore, is not ordinary consciousness at all, and the bliss arises from this state of non-distinction. Hence we have two different conceptions which are repeated times without number: on the one hand every empirical attribute is attributed to the absolute and also denied of it: in the second place the most contradictory

[Part V 

observations are made regarding it. The ideas thus enunciated are clear: the absolute is not in space 1 which is expressed by the assertion that it is infinitely large and infinitely small, that space is interwoven in it, and that it is all pervading. The absolute is not in time: 2 hence it appears as above the three times, independent of the past and the future, at its feet time rolls on its course on the one hand it is of infinite duration, but at the same time it is of the instantaneous character of the flash of the lightning, or the swift rush of thought. The absolute is also free from causal connexion: 3 it is said to be absolutely without diversity, and this point is variously developed the Katha is emphatic that the absolute is independent of becoming and not becoming, of good and evil, of past and future, the knowing seer is not born, does not die, abides from everlasting. The IŚã 5 insists that it is unmoving, yet swifter than mind; far, yet near; within, yet without the universe; above knowledge and ignorance; that it differs essentially from coming into being and not coming into being. The final answer to the question of the nature of the Atman is that recorded for us in a legend by Śankara: Vāṣkali asked Bahva as to the nature of the Brahman: the latter remained silent, and on being pressed for an answer replied, 'I teach you, indeed, but you understand not: silence is the Atman.'
