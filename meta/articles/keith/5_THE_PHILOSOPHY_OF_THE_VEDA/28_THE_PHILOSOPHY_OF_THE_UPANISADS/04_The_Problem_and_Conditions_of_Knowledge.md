It is an essential feature of the Upanisads that, though they make, as we have seen, little or no advance in logical doctrine, they do tentatively raise and deal in some measure with the question of the source of knowledge of the Brahman or Atman. The view of the Brahmaṇas, of course, is that knowledge is to be found in the Vedas, and the authority of the Vedic texts is not discussed. In the Upanisads, however, we find that the question of the means of knowledge is definitely raised: the three Vedas or the four, which are sometimes recognized, are not always recognized as the sources of complete knowledge Cvetaketu, despite much Vedic learning, cannot solve the question of transmigration, Narada admits to Sanatkumāra his incompetence to understand the Atman. The Taittiriya Upanisad1 expressly reduces the knowledge

The Philosophy of the Veda 

[Part V 

of the Vedas to an inferior position by assigning them to the stage of the mindmade Atman, which has to be surmounted before reaching the final truth. But these views were gradually and naturally supplemented by another, which makes the Upanisads an essential part, the secret instruction, of the Veda hence the term Vedanta which first occurs in the CvetaŚvatara Upanisad and denotes the Upanisads, as the end of the Veda in which its deepest secret is disclosed.

The Brāhmaṇas had recognized, beside study of the Veda, the duty of sacrifice, and the importance of asceticism, and on both these points the thinkers of the Upaniṣads were bound to take a clear stand. The sacrifice is least reputed in the Bṛhadaranyaka Upanisad where, with a certain insolence, the worship of anything except the self is derided, and the relation of the ordinary worshipper to his gods is compared with that of housedogs. Again Yama is said to have his abode in the sacrifice, and the sacrifice in the fees. The Chandogya 3 also seems in part to recognize the demerits of the sacrifice. But it would be an error to think that the general depreciation of the sacrifice is characteristic of the Brahmans; it is clear that a few enlightened minds had a poor opinion of the whole apparatus, but the normal view of the Upanisads is quite removed from that of opposition to sacrifice, which is often believed to mark them out. The sacrifice, however, is expressly relegated to an inferior place: the faithful performance of offerings takes a man but to the world of the Fathers, whence he will return to earth again in due course, and not thus can final liberation be won. On the other hand the actual performance of the sacrifice is rendered needless by the substitute for the ritual acts of allegorical acts: the three periods of life supersede the three Soma offerings, inhalation and speech the Agnihotra, the organs of the self the four priests, and so on. The tendency, however, to restore the sacrifice to honour steadily grows the Katha recognizes it as of value. the ŚvetaŚvatara recommends recourse to it, the Maitrāyaṇīya asserts that without the study of the Veda, the observance of caste duties, and the following of the orders of life, through the stage of student householder, forest hermit, and wandering ascetic, the reunion of the individual and the personal self is impossible. Doubtless in this we can recognize the growing aversion of the Brahmans to the Buddhist and the Jain tenets.

The part of asceticism in the pursuit of knowledge is similar to that of the sacrifice. The Bṛhadaranyaka 10 is not inclined towards it, recognizing in it as in sacrifice at most a way to the lower bliss of the world of the Fathers,11

the Chandogya 1 substitutes the faith of the forest dweller for penance. The Taittiriya Upanisad, on the other hand, places value on Vedic study and asceticism, and even insists on the supreme value of the latter: the Mahānā- rāyaṇa 3 sets renunciation, Nyasa, above even asceticism: and from the Kena onwards the value of asceticism for the obtaining of the knowledge of the Brahman is absolutely recognized and sometimes insisted upon. In this, as in regard to Vedic study and sacrifice, the process is one of steady accommodation to the popular view, which was at the same time the profitable view to the priests. It is needless, however, to see in this the fact of the borrowing of the theory of the Atman from an external source: the facts accord perfectly with a reform within the Brahmanical fold: the reformers gradually sink back into the main body, while their doctrine in some degree at least is adopted by the main body of the priests.

Nor in the oldest stratum of the Upanisads do we find the necessity of instruction by a teacher laid down: Yajñavalkya on several occasions teaches persons such as his wife, Maitreyi, informally and without initiation, and AŚvapati teaches the Brahmans who come to him freely. The rule of taking a teacher is absolute in the Katha,' and is approved in the Chandogya, where the teacher is regarded as being as essential as the removal of a bandage to a blindfolded man, who wishes to find his way home to Gandhara. In these texts the vague requirements also occur that a man should be endowed with self-restraint, renunciation, tranquillity, patience, and collectedness.

But beyond these minor matters, which are none of them recognized as essential in the oldest Upanisads, a further question arises, how far there can be real knowledge at all of the Atman. The natural desire of the philosopher is to know the Atman: the Upanisads are in very real sense the search for that knowledge, but the conviction is clearly early felt that there were serious difficulties in assuming the possibility of empiric means giving the desired result. The Rigveda already contained the idea that the first principle in some degree disguised itself, and the world of name and form becomes in the Bṛhadaranyaka 10 the immortal concealed in truth, or reality, and as the reality of reality is seen the self. The only normal sense which can be given to these passages is that suggested by the description of the whole universe in the Chandogya as a matter of words, a mere name. The reality of the world is empiric, the true reality is the Atman, which the empiric reality conceals. It follows, therefore, that all so-called knowledge is really ignorance, Avidya, and that in death in casting off the body the soul throws aside ignorance.12

The Philosophy of the Veda 

[Part V 

The Katha illustrates this theme: ordinary knowledge aims at pleasure, real knowledge at salvation, and it must be accorded through a teacher,2 and by the favour of the Atman,3 a doctrine which develops into the express declaration that the favour of the creator is essential. The CvetaŚvatara " carries us to the logical result and offers prayers to the gods for assistance, inculcating devotion, Bhakti, to god and to the teacher.

On the other hand, there arises in the doctrine of Yajnavalkya a distinct and different element: the self in this view cannot be known at all. There is no consciousness after death, he explains to Maitreyi, and the grounds of his explanation are that duality is essential for consciousness. The absolute self is unknowable, for there is no duality between it and anything else: the individual self is also unknowable because it must be the activity in knowing, and cannot be the object. The doctrine has echoes in other Upani- ṣads, and it results in fierce attacks on knowledge, which is ranked as worse than ignorance by the IŚa. The Katha lays stress on the necessity of turning the eye inwards in contrast to the mere use of the senses to grasp what is external, and insists that the only assertion that can be made of the self is the mere declaration of existence pure and simple. The way is, therefore, clearly open to the development of the doctrine alluded to in the earlier Upanisads, but not developed until later, which seeks by means of processes of physical and psychical disposition to produce the trance condition in which unity with the absolute, the only possible form of knowledge, is arrived at.
