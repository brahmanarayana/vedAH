title = "01 The Origin of the Upanisads"

+++

NATIVE tradition1 derives the term Upanisad, by means which will not bear scrutiny, from roots which yield as its sense either that which destroys innate ignorance, or that which leads to the Brahman. It is more important to note that from an early period the utmost stress is laid on the secret character of the instruction contained in these works: the rule is that they are the highest mysteries, and that their doctrines should not be imparted to any pupil, other than a son, who has not already studied with the teacher for a year and who does not intend himself to become a teacher. The same view is enforced by the facts recounted in the texts: when the deepest part of the discussions arrives, the two concerned go apart and talk of the new doctrine of action as the source of human fate. 

When, therefore, we seek for an origin of the term which will not defy the laws of etymology, it is necessary to find something which will accord with this essential nature of secrecy. The word is derived obviously from the prefixes upa-ni and sad, 'sit', and the only natural meaning is a session, a sitting down near some person, who naturally is assumed to be the teacher. This accords with the mode of teaching followed in India, which, as we have seen, involved the sitting of the pupil and the teacher facing each other, while the latter repeated the lesson to be learned by the former. The lessons of the teacher to his pupil were not public in the ordinary sense of the word: to be practicable they naturally required quiet, but the ritual texts show us more than that they bear witness that certain texts of special importance were to be taught to the pupil in the forest, and not in the normal place, the abode of the teacher. With this accords admirably the fact that the Upanisads form parts of, or are attached in the case of the most important and old of these works to, texts which tradition gives the names of Aranyaka.2 The name must clearly, as held by Oldenberg, have been derived from the fact that the discussions contained in these works were studied in the forest; the alternative view that the Aranyakas were specially intended for study by

the Vanaprasthas, men who, after serving their apprenticeship as Brahman students and having performed as householders their duties, retire to the forests to study, is clearly a more advanced conception than that obtained in the early Upaniṣads. The later view is an artificial conception, and one which grew up only with the strict division of stages of life enjoined on Brahmans, if not always observed. Naturally, however, the Aranyakas, in so far as they are texts of allegorical interpretation of the sacrifice, were studied by such Vanaprasthas more than were the Brāhmaṇas proper, which were rather ritual in their interest, and presumed that the sacrifice was actually being performed. The Aranyakas in their more distinctive portions deal with the meaning of the offering, without necessarily assuming that it will be performed: they some- times suggest modes of performing the sacrifice by meditation and repetition- as of the Hotṛ formulae only. But the distinction of Brahmana and Aranyaka is not an absolute one: in no case have we in the works handed down to us Brāhmaṇas which always suppose the performance of ritual, or Aranyakas which assume that it is not to be performed. Nor can we see why the dis- tinction, which was probably the real one between the Brāhmaṇas and the Aranyakas, the comparative sanctity of their contents, should have attached itself to precisely the ceremonies to which it did so attach itself. The ritual texts of the different Vedas show us clearly the fact that certain rites and texts were regarded as especially sacred, to be performed outside the village, and these texts are contained not merely in Aranyakas but even in the Samhita form. Thus the Pravargya rite is treated in this fashion in the Taittiriya Aranyaka iv and v, while the Mantras concerned are also to be found in the later part of the Vajasaneyi Samhita," in which they are followed by other Mantras, containing certain dread names of the Maruts and certain invocations of formidable character used in the horse sacrifice. The Aranyagana of the Samaveda and the Aranyaka Samhita contain the secret texts of that Veda, and the Aitareya and Śāñkhāyana Aranyakas 5 present the secret texts of the Rigveda, of which the most important is that concerning the Mahavrata, an old and popular rite, while the former contains also the Mahānāmni verses, 

with Oldenberg. Oltramare (L'histoire des idées théosophiques, i. 63, n. 1) suggests 'introduction' or 'initiation', hence mystic doctrine.

which appear in a form strange to the manner of the Rigveda and akin to that of the Samaveda, in which they are also found. Both texts contain also certain mystic doctrines regarding the Samhita form of the text of the Rigveda, and the Śankhāyana deals also with the Mantha. Both also include, like the Taittiriya, philosophical Upanisads. The Aitareyins and the Kauṣitakins of the Rigveda placed the Mahāvrata ceremony in the rank of a fit subject for an Aranyaka, but the Yajurveda allowed it to appear in the Samhita, and the Samaveda treats of it in the PañcavinŚa and Jaiminiya Brāhmaṇas. But we can realize how from their superior sanctity the tendency grew for these treatises to be used as the places of the record of the secret doctrines, which gradually, in the mind of the priests, took the place of the more material performance of the ritual.

As the distinction between Brāhmaṇa and Aranyaka is not an absolute one, though the Aranyakas tend to contain more advanced doctrines than the Brāhmaṇas, so the distinction between Upanisad and Aranyakas is also not absolute, tradition actually incorporating the Upanisads in some cases in the Aranyakas. The most that can be said is that the term Upanisad, when applied to a text, normally denotes that it contains speculation mainly on the nature of the universe and of the Atman or the Brahman. Its use in the Upanisad is in one or other of the senses 'secret word' or 'phrase ', 'secret text' or 'secret import'. Thus, when the phrase1 neti neti, 'not so, not so', is used as an expression of the highest unity, that is an Upanisad; or again the word jalan 2 as indicating that in which beings breathe, perish, and are born, or the phrase 3 satyasya satyam, the truth of the true', or tadvanam as the final end is so described. In the texts of the Taittiriya school in special the phrase is used at the end of a section of philosophical teaching as a descrip- tion of that teaching. Or the word is applied to a special subject of knowledge, such as the meaning of the word Om. In a slightly different way we hear of a man's Upanisad, which denotes his secret rule of life, such as that one should not beg. In these senses the term Aranyaka is never used, and thus we can perhaps see why the two different words Aranyaka and Upaniṣad came into being. The former is a name, denoting the generic character of the texts, as those which from their secret nature must be dealt with in the special manner of being studied in the forest; the latter is a secret text, imparted at such a secret session, and in course of time more and more specifically appropriated to the description of secrets which were of philosophical character. Beyond these generalisms we are hardly likely to be able to penetrate. 

Two different theories of the origin of the term have, however, been urged 

(ZII. i. 58-68), who inclines to overesti- mate the age of the verses, as of Rigvedic rank, unfortunately ignores entirely Oldenberg's work.

and require some notice. It is the view of Oldenberg 1 that the real sense of Upanisad is worship or reverence, that the word expresses the same ideas as Upasana, and that it is due to the constant practice of the text to recom- mend the adoration of the Brahman or the Atman under the guise of some symbol. There can be no doubt about the fact of the use of symbols in this way, but it is certain that the use of upa-sad as a verb in the Upaniṣads is always quite clearly distinguished from the meaning worship', and relates only to the going to a teacher, and sitting beside him for instruction: it is admitted that in this sense the normal use is upa-sad, not upa-ni-sad, but it is also plausible that the choice of the term was dictated by the fact that Upasad has in the ritual a very definite meaning of its own, which rendered the selection of a different word desirable to describe the action intended. In the second place it is clear that the idea of reverence or worship must have passed away at an early date from its original sense, and that, therefore, there is nothing to commend it on the ground of simplicity as an explanation: the Taittiriya Upanisad uses the term of the mere knowledge of the combina- tion of letters, and the sense' rule ', as in not to beg', cannot be deduced from worship' as easily as secret instruction' can be deduced from 'session', beside a teacher, as opposed to a gathering for open discussion, Pariṣad or Samsad. In the third place, though this is not at all conclusive, the Atman or the Brahman is not properly the object of reverence at all, since reverence implies the very duality which the Upanisads deny, and, if in reality the origin of the word lay in that sense, then it must be admitted that the Upanisads bear a name which their essential doctrine transcends. This of course is quite possible in itself: the other two considerations set out make it improbable.

The view of the word taken by Deussen 3 differs from that adopted above, which sees in it a natural counterpart to the term Aranyakas, and derives it from the tradition of the Vedic school teaching, in that it assumes a break in the development of the thought of India. For that view it should be observed that there is the advantage of continuity: the Brāhmaṇas shade off imper- ceptibly into the Aranyakas, the Aranyakas shade off into the Upanisads without violent change of any kind. But on the theory of Deussen we are not to adopt the view that secret import on the subjective, and secret instruction on the objective side, were the meanings developed from the secret teaching in the forest. On the contrary we are to believe that, at this point at a time when the Brahmans were still bent on the study of the ritual, the warrior class developed a new and striking philosophy, which they expressed in secret

formulae like tajjalan,1 called Upanisads, because the essence of their character was secret communications, and that these doctrines were accompanied by secret explanations, from which in the course of time arose the first Upanisads. We must, it is claimed and has been argued by Garbe 2 with great emphasis, accept the view that it was not to the Brahmans, but to the warriors, to the princes, and the nobles, and to the wisdom of kings that India owed its philosophy. 

5 

This argument rests on facts recorded in the texts themselves, in which kings appear as authorities on philosophy. In the Chandogya Upanisad five learned Brahmans desire to learn from Uddalaka Aruni the nature of the Atman VaiŚvānara: he doubts his ability to explain it, and as a result all six betake themselves to the king AŚvapati Kaikeya, who gives them instruction, after first demonstrating the inaccuracy of their knowledge. In a narrative which is preserved in the Brhadaranyaka Upanisad and in the Kauṣitaki Upanisad a scholar, Gargya Bālāki, undertakes to set out the nature of the Brahman to the king AjātaŚatru of KaŚi: he propounds twelve views-or in the Kauṣitaki sixteen-which are all defective, and the king then explains the Atman to him by the principle of deep sleep, prefacing his instruction by the observation that it is a reverse of the rule for a Brahman to betake himself to a Ksatriya for instruction. Another legend in the Chandogya 

6 shows the Brahmans being instructed in the nature of ether, as the ultimate basis of all things, by the king Pravahaṇa Jaivali. It is added that Atidhanvan once gave the same knowledge to UdaraŚãṇḍilya, and the former name might be that of a prince. Less important is the fact that the Brahman Narada is represented in the Chandogya as being the recipient of information from Sanatkumāra, later the god of war, who tells the former that all his Vedic lore is a mere name. The great text regarding the doctrine of transmigration is set out by Pravāhaṇa Jaivali to Aruni with the remark that the Brahmans have never before had this information, which so far had remained the monopoly of the Ksatriyas. In a third version of this account, given in the Kausītaki Upanisad, the king is Citra Gāñgyāyani.

Now it is always difficult to believe in the sudden evolution of new doctrines, actually associated in the name with the conception of the absolute of the Brahman class, by circles, whose duty was presumably to wield the weapons of war, and who at any rate failed to retain the control of these doctrines: it is absolutely certain that the Upanisads, as we have them, are not the work of 

in the Upanisads of the Yajurveda, the royal Veda, and this is certainly not an argument of any value.

warriors, that they were handed down by priests, and that, if the warrior class originated these doctrines, they failed to continue the interest they had shown in them.1 Stress must also be laid as against the supporters of the theory on the divergent views taken by them of the real work done by the Ksatriyas. To Garbe they appear to have revolted from the sacrifice, and to have introduced a monist philosophy, centring in the idea of the Brahman- presumably appropriated by them, with a curious sense of humour, from their rivals. The doctrine of Karman is expressly claimed as theirs, so that they must be held, while adopting a monist philosophy, to have insisted on the importance of morality. On the other hand, the Brahmans were forced to adopt this Kṣatriya view by the pressure of public opinion, which compelled them to adopt it into their own system. This, frankly, appears a very curious conception; it is remarkable that the public should insist on a philosophic monism, when we remember that throughout Indian history we find every form of worship pursued with a painful eagerness and precision, and when we remember also how little popular opinion anywhere insists on a strict monism, especially one which empties life of any reality. A further difficulty arises when we find that the Ksatriyas are credited by Garbe 2 with the creation of the Samkhya philosophy as a revolt against prevailing views; apparently one set of Ksatriyas operated against another, and, as he accepts Ksatriya doctrines as the basis of Buddhism, we find that the great schism in Indian views was that of one Ksatriya view against another. Hertel, again, who accepts the doctrine of the Ksatriya origin of the philosophy of the Upanisads, ignores the fact that the doctrine of Karman is their chief claim, and insists instead that they were rationalists who depersonalized the old gods, substituting in lieu the idea of nature powers-called by them faute de mieux, through the poverty of language of the time, deities, and whose philosophy was essentially a monism atheistic, materialistic, and morally indifferent. Judged on this basis it may be doubted if the praise lavished on the Ksatriyas at the expense of the Brahmans would have exactly been acceptable to them. 

As has been indicated, stress is naturally laid in support of the theory of Kṣatriya influence on the explicit assertion of the king that the knowledge of transmigration had never belonged to any Brahmans, but the assertion is a very odd one: the king claims that the 'giving of instruction' has been the possession of the warriors because the Brahmans have not studied this doctrine, but even for India such a thought is absurd and meaningless, and reduces the claim of the king to what, it seems, is an idle vaunt. Then again, as it is impossible to deny that the Atman-Brahman doctrine has a long pre- vious history in the Brahmanas, and is a logical development of the idea of 

1 A further complication is adduced by 

those who believe that Buddhism was promoted by Ksatriyas of Mongolian origin (V. Smith, Oxford History of India, p. 47); the precise relations of these sets of Ksatriyas does not 

appear to be explained by their supporters.

unity of the Rigveda, we must admit that the warrior class must have shared in the intellectual development, which produced that idea, and then started a fresh view-which nevertheless was based on the Brahman, not the Kṣatra- in opposition to the sacrifice, while the priests were deeply engaged in the sacrifice. But the sacrifices were essentially not matters in which the priest acted for himself: he aimed at securing the profit of his patron, and the patrons for the great sacrifices must have been in the main the very warrior class, which we are to assume turned with disgust from the sacrifice.1 The true solution of the problem is suggested by the obvious difficulties of the position of the maintainers of the theory: we must adopt a solution which explains why the whole Upanisad tradition is Brahmanical, and yet why the texts record actions of importance as regards the doctrine by the princes of earth. It is absurd to imagine that these references would have been left to stand had the Brahmans found them derogatory to their dignity: the sense of historical accuracy must have been very strong, incredibly so indeed, which would have induced a priesthood to preserve an exact account of the royal founders of each doctrine, and that they did so is sufficiently disproved by the mere fact that they clearly did not preserve a true account even of the Brahman founders of their doctrines. The prominence of Yajnavalkya can hardly be historical, since he is also the great ritual teacher of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, and the device of assuming more than one man of the same name is absurd in this as in many other cases, since the texts assume that the two are the same: nor again does any one really believe that Sanatkumāra was a human king. The explanation 2 becomes simple enough when we look at the Brahmanas and the Rigveda: there we find that kings are often mentioned as generous donors that there are lists of the great kings who performed sacrifices, and who beyond all things gave fees to the priest, just as in historical times great kings, like Puṣyamitra and Samudragupta, boast of their offerings. It was clearly necessary for the priests, who abandoned the doctrine of sacrifice, to live they, therefore, had to find patrons and they must accordingly, like their predecessors, the sacrificial priests, represent their teachings as worth large sums. As a king must sacrifice to give gifts, so he must at least understand, and take part in discussions, to give gifts, and the position of the kings might casily be wholly deduced from the needs of the priest. But it would be un- necessary, and, it may be added, perhaps unjust to hold this view the thought of the Upanisads with all its demerits is a far nobler thing than the thought of the Brāhmaṇas: as later among the Buddhists, the minds which could rise from the mere sacrifice to the consideration of the self were quite capable of accepting help from other minds: of low origin, Satyakāma,

whose mother was a mere slave girl Jabālā, who ran about with men and who could not tell his father, was taken as a pupil by Haridrumata and attained the complete knowledge: 1 even the epic, in one of its juster moments, allows a learned Śudra honour and permits a merchant to instruct a Brahman." In modern India saints of the highest rank have been other than Brahmans in caste. The princes were now and then seers, like Divodāsa, son of VadhryaŚva, and they may for their part have now and then wearied of the sacrifice, and sought a higher truth, just as, inversely, we hear of seers who sought kingly rank for their offspring, and there may be that degree of accuracy in the figure played by them in the legends. But that the philo- sophy of the Brahmanas as seen in the Upanisads is essentially the develop- ment of the philosophy of the Brāhmaṇas cannot reasonably be doubted. Nor is there any ground for thinking that the philosophy had its chief home anywhere save in the holy ground of the Brahmans, the land of Kurukṣetra, which seems to have been in this period as in the earlier epoch the place of Brahmanical culture par excellence. The culture was not absolutely restricted to that area: the mention of AŚvapati Kaikeya carries us further to the north- west, while we hear of Brahmans who dwelt in Magadha,' though that was rare. The Kauṣitaki Upanisad 8 preserves for us in the movements of Gargya Bālāki the traces of the extent of the activity of the new movement: he went among the Kurus, the Pañcālas, the two folks then being joined, the KaŚis and Videhas, and the VaŚas and Matsyas, and among the UŚinaras. All this accords with the extent of the land in which the sacrifice was prevalent, and the addition of the Kosalas would complete the list: doubtless their omission here is mere chance. Other allusions to countries do not show any substantial extension of the geographical horizon of the authors: the Vindhya mountains are, it seems, known to the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, and this is perhaps a proof that the Vedic civilization was extending southwards in greater degree than in the preceding period. The references to the Indus region, whence came salt and noble horses, suggest that it was afar off, but against this is to be set the mention of Gandhara as not at all a distant country in the Chandogya Upanisad.10 But culture was not in any event rigidly confined to the middle country scholars in their wanderings penetrated as far as the Madras, on the Hyphasis.11

inhabitants, Dravidians or others. It has frequently been suggested that the philosophy of the Upanisads is essentially Dravidian rather than Aryan, and plausible grounds can be adduced in this sense.1 Thus, we may be fairly certain that, as time went on, Dravidian blood came more and more to pre- vail over Aryan, though in candour we should admit that the evidence on this head is purely speculative in the absence of any real knowledge of the Aryan physical type which entered India. In the second place the changes in language may be due to Dravidian influence; 2 here again the evidence is scanty enough, in the absence of independent evidence of the Dravidian languages for the period of the Brahmanas and Upanisads, and the difficulty of tracing to them any definite influence on the language; the use of cerebral or domal letters, and forms like the second future (kartāsmi) or perfect participle used verbally (kṛtavān), or the development of constructions with the in- declinable gerund, may have been encouraged by tendencies among the Dravidians; but this cannot be definitely established. That Rudra-Śiva is mainly aboriginal is rather a guess based on the belief that the name denotes 'red' than an ascertained fact, and we have no assurance on the strength of which we could claim that the use of trance and asceticism or caste were Dravidian elements appropriated by the Aryans. The pantheism of the Upanisads may be deemed to be a philosophical development from the animistic views which Jainism and in a sense Buddhism presents, and which may be contrasted with the anthropomorphic nature gods of the Aryans, and a contrast may be drawn between Iranian religion and Indian, suggesting that the former presents us a picture of the practical Aryan mind as opposed to the more mystic Indian intelligence. These contentions, we may admit, do not lead to any assured results in the sense of establishing the Dravidian 4 claim. What they indicate is the unquestionable fact that the Upanisads, as in some degree all earlier thought in India, represent the outcome of the reflections of a people whose blood was mixed. We may, if we desire, call the Upanisads the product of Aryo-Dravidian thought; but, if we do so, we must remember that the effect of the intermixture must be regarded in the light of chemical fusion, in which both elements are transformed.
