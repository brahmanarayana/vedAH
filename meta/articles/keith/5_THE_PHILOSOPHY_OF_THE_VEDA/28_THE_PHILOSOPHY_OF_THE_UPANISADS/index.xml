      <description>NATIVE tradition1 derives the term Upanisad, by means which will not bear scrutiny, from roots which yield as its sense either that which destroys innate ignorance, or that which leads to the Brahman. It is more important to note that from an early period the utmost stress is laid on the secret character of the instruction contained in these works: the rule is that they are the highest mysteries, and that their doctrines should not be imparted to any pupil, other than a son, who has not already studied with the teacher for a year and who does not intend himself to become a teacher.</description>

The texts which have come down to us are certainly not the beginning of the intellectual activity of the time: they bear every trace in their manner and matter of representing the result of many discussions, and deviations of opinion among the priestly schools. The doctrines have been handled and

      <description>It was attempted by the great philosopher Śankara to find in the Upani- ṣads the expression of a single simple doctrine, carried out consistently through all, and in his commentary on the Vedanta as set out in the Brahma Sūtra of Badarāyaṇa it is his object to interpret that Sutra and to bring out at the same time the doctrines of the Upanisṣads, the whole forming a great system of philosophy in which no contradictions should exist.</description>

      <description>It is an essential feature of the Upanisads that, though they make, as we have seen, little or no advance in logical doctrine, they do tentatively raise and deal in some measure with the question of the source of knowledge of the Brahman or Atman. The view of the Brahmaṇas, of course, is that knowledge is to be found in the Vedas, and the authority of the Vedic texts is not discussed.</description>

      <title>05 The Nature of the Absolute</title>

      <description>The Upanisads are essentially concerned with the endeavour to describe the nature of the absolute, and the rich abundance of attempts to succeed in this end, proved by the references to conflicting theories in the Upanisads, is clear proof of the busy mental activity of the period. From the earliest Upanisad we have, the view is clear that there is a unity, that it is necessary further to grasp the nature of that unity, and that the proper names of the unity are either the Brahman or the Atman.</description>

      <title>06 The Absolute and the Universe</title>

      <description>The theory of Yajnavalkya asserts, as we have seen, that the absolute is unknowable and not definable by any empirical predicates. It, therefore, becomes obviously a pressing question to connect the empirical and the real universes: the gulf between the two is only accentuated by asserting, in so determined a manner, that there is a deep division between the one and the many. The relation of the universe as known to the one is, however, the problem which all philosophies find insoluble in greater or less degree, and the efforts of the Upaniṣads to bridge the difference are not at all satisfactory.</description>

      <description>(a) ILLUSION
In the doctrine of Yajnavalkya we have seen the tendency of the Upani- ṣads to assert over again, and in still more emphatic terms, the unity of the world, which the poets of the Rigveda already foreshadowed, and to deduce from it the conclusion that the world is nothing that is real in the full sense of the word, since everything in it is not ultimately to be regarded as having a truth of its own.</description>

      <title>08 The Supreme and the Individual Souls</title>

      <description>In the philosophy of Yajñavalkya the identity of the supreme and the individual souls is carried to the extreme extent, but at the same time the term soul is deprived of any distinct meaning. The identity of the soul of man and the absolute is due to the mere fact that, by reducing the soul to nothing save what may be termed the mere abstraction of subjectivity, or of the transcendental unity of apperception, the soul becomes nothing but an aspect of a process.</description>

      <description>The soul, despite its close connexion with the body, which we have traced in detail, is also enabled by its nature to approach closely the absolute. The spirit is most remote from the absolute in its normal waking activities: in that case the senses and the mind are at work, but when there is sleep the senses and the mind are merged in the breath. A further distinction is then made between the condition of the soul in the sleep of dreams, and in deep dreamless sleep, in which the soul enters into the purest light, and then as a consequence of its own nature emerges again from it.</description>

      <description>The origin of the doctrine of transmigration is one of the most difficult problems of Indian philosophy: its extraordinarily firm hold on the mind of part at least of India, which is shown by the fact that Buddhism rests on the doctrine as an essential presupposition, makes it natural to seck the view in the earliest period of Indian religion, and this desire to find metempsychosis in the beginnings of Indian belief takes two forms.</description>

      <description>In the view of the Buddhist the world is misery, and the whole end of man is to remove the misery of existence from himself by the destruction of that desire, which leads ever from birth to birth. But the wholesale pessimism of the Buddhist is by no means characteristic of the Upanisṣads: to find real pessimism in them, as apart from mild expressions of the unsatisfactoriness of the finite compared with the infinite, is impossible.</description>

      <description>In comparison with the intellectual activity of the Brahmans the ethical content of the Upanisads must be said to be negligible and valueless. The total impression conveyed by the Upanisads is that of an intellectual exercise, whose aim was the attainment partly of immediate goods, partly of the highest good, normally the happiness of heaven which was often materially enough conceived, and there is made no attempt to make the theoretical philosophy a ground of morality of any sort.</description>

      <description>What judgement are we to pass on the main thought of the Upanisads? Are they really the expressions at an early date of the deepest principles of philosophy, or are they merely of historical value, interesting pictures of the early thought of man, important not per se, but because of their dominating influence on the future philosophy and life of India? The two interpreters, who have of recent times been most impressed by the nature of that philosophy as idealism, have passed the most diametrically opposed views on the question: Gough was impressed with the necessity of explaining the defects of the subject of which he treated by the admixture of blood among the Indians, and the corrupting influences of a low order of civilization, while Deussen is lost in admiration of the Upanisads, as was Schopenhauer before him: &amp;lsquo;Eternal philosophical truth&amp;rsquo;, he says, &amp;lsquo;has seldom found more decisive and striking expression than in the doctrine of the emancipating knowledge of the Atman &amp;rsquo; He claims that Yajñavalkya had anticipated the view of Schopenhauer regarding immortality as indestructibility without continued existence; he regards the view of the nature of the self as an anticipation of the doctrine of Kant; he defends the doctrine of transmigration as the best expression of the true state of matters in the terms of empirical thought, while recognizing that such an expression is misleading: nay, he argues that the Kantian argument regarding immortality, based on the realization of the moral law within us, points not to ordinary immortality, but rather to the process of transmigration, and transmigration has been solemnly upheld as philosophic doctrine at the present time by competent authorities at the present time by competent authorities.</description>
