(a) ILLUSION 

In the doctrine of Yajnavalkya we have seen the tendency of the Upani- ṣads to assert over again, and in still more emphatic terms, the unity of the world, which the poets of the Rigveda already foreshadowed, and to deduce from it the conclusion that the world is nothing that is real in the full sense of the word, since everything in it is not ultimately to be regarded as having a truth of its own. In what sense, then, can the empiric world be said to exist? This Yājñavalkya leaves vague, but in his exposition to Maitreyi of the doctrine that after death there is no consciousness he uses terms to which later at least great weight was attached. A duality is necessary, he argued, for one to see another, smell another, hear another, and so forth, and in death no such duality is present; the phrase, however, which he uses in this contention is 'where there is a duality as it were (iva)', and it may be deduced, not unfairly, from the addition of the qualification that he was not prepared to admit as absolutely certain the existence of the duality. Later in the Upani- ṣad we have similar wording, 'when there seems to be another', the same

particle being used. Here again we cannot simply ignore the qualification; to do so is as one-sided as to ascribe to it the value of a definite assertion of the unreality or illusory character of the universe. What we have is the germ of the illusion theory. 

A further passage which has been adduced in this connexion is the declara- tion of the Chandogya Upanisad1 regarding the modifications of the three fundamental constituents of being, fire, water, food; just as all that is made of clay, copper, or iron, is only a modification, a verbal expression (vācāram- bhana), a mere name, the reality being clay, copper, or iron, so all things can be reduced to the three primary forms of reality. Further, all reality, it is clearly indicated, is reducible to reality only, all things being mere modifica- tions, &c. In Deussen's view 2 we have here the first open assertion of the unreality of the universe, a doctrine which shortly afterwards was to be realized by Parmenides in the famous declaration : 

τῷ πάντ' ὄνομ ̓ ἔσται 

ὅσσα βροτοὶ κατέθεντο πεποιθότες εἶναι ἀληθῆ γίγνεσθαί τε καὶ ὄλλυσθαι, 

and later by Spinoza in his doctrine of modes of the one substance, God. The alternative view 3 is to regard the whole as frankly realistic; the name is not a mere name in the sense of disguising a reality; on the contrary it serves to mark out a reality, just as the phrase nama-rupa can be used to designate a concrete individual made up of intellectual and other faculties and matter. In this case we have a doctrine frankly pantheistic, but not of illusion. The difficulty of deciding is increased by the uncertainty of the correct rendering of the text, which Deussen interprets as directly asserting that 'change is a mere matter of words, a simple name', treating the words vācārambhaṇaṁ vikāro nāmadheyam as a distinct sentence, instead--as is possible of taking it as a predicate description, 'a matter of words, a change, a simple name', and it would be unwise to draw any far-reaching conclusion from the passage. 

We find also in the Bṛhadaranyaka Upanisad in a verse which occurs with slight variation in the Katha, a distinct assertion that there is no diversity and that a failure to realize this fact is the source of repeated death. The IŚa emphatically demands that the universe be merged in God, and, moreover, denies becoming and passing away, thus condemning the doctrine. of the reality of change; this at least is Deussen's interpretation, though it is open to argue that the real sense is merely that the absolute stands above becoming and passing away, which it transcends. In the late Maitrāyaṇīya Upanisad' we find the comparison of the absolute with the spark which, made

to revolve, creates apparently a fiery circle, an idea which is taken up and expanded by Gauḍapada in the Maṇḍūkya Kārikā, and which undoubtedly is consistent with the conception of the illusory nature of empirical reality. In other cases adduced by Deussen 1 there is no need to suspect any idea of the world as unreal, the frequent assertion, that with the knowledge of the self all is known, does not exclude the reality of what is derived from the self; the reality of the absolute may be contrasted 3 with empirical reality, which is styled real by man, without making the latter an illusion; when the Aitareya asserts that the universe is founded in consciousness and guided by it, it assumes its reality, not its merely apparent existence, and, if the elements of being rest on the consciousness and it on the Prana, we need not suspect any lack of reality in them.

Far more importance attaches to a late Upanisad. The precise character of the nature of the external world is sunimed up finally in the doctrine of the ŚvetaŚvatara Upanisad,' which sees in the world other than the absolute- which it conceives in a theistic way-an illusion, Māyā, a term thus first introduced into the philosophy of the Upanisads, to become, through the adoption of this theory of the universe by Gauḍapada and Śankara, the basis of the orthodox Vedanta system. It would, however, it is clear, be a mistake to regard the new term as being a mere individual innovation of the ŚvetāŚvatara school without previous preparation in the literary tradition. The idea of the concealment of the divine nature by illusion is seen in the Atharvaveda, where it is said that the flower of the water, who is Hiranya- garbha, the personal Brahman, in whom are fixed gods and men as spokes in a nave, is concealed by illusion, and the illusions of Indra in his many shapes are mentioned in the Rigveda." It may, therefore, be assumed that the term had obtained considerable favour in philosophic circles,10 before it appears in the Upanisad as a definite doctrine of importance. Still more important is the fact that the term was by no means ill adapted to express the nature of the relation of the empirical world to the real absolute, as it was conceived by Yajnavalkya. It is, of course, impossible to say that the actual term and its precise connotation would have approved themselves to that sage, or to those who evolved the doctrines which passed current under his name: on the other hand, the doctrine is a legitimate and natural development from the principles which he enunciated. They are clearly not to be derived in any reasonable way from a system, which was pantheistic or cosmogonic, and in which, therefore, the assumption that the world was illusory would have been ridiculous. A pantheism and still more a cosmogonism are under the danger of falling to the level of materialism, but not of evoking an illusionism.

The Philosophy of the Veda 

[Part V 

A very different suggestion as to the development of ideas is put forward by Schayer.1 On this theory the Maya doctrine comes in as the expression of a conception wholly alien to the normal Brahmanical idea of the regular working of the world, in which nature and the ritual stand in constant paral- lelism. The Brahman signifies the regular and orderly procedure of the universe; Māyā, on the other hand, introduces the conception of the unregu- lated, self-determined, intervention of a god; Indra's Maya in the Rigveda 2 is the expression of his might, revealed in his great deeds. When, naturally, opposition came into being directed against the Brahmanical conception of the Übermensch whose knowledge makes him ruler of the universe, we find the idea of the necessity of divine intervention as in the Katha Upanisad,3 and the condemnation by the IŚa of knowledge as even more unsatisfactory than ignorance, and finally in the CvetaŚvatara 5 the natural step is taken of ascribing to god the epithet māyāvin. The suggestion is ingenious but uncon- vincing. The CvetaŚvatara certainly does not mean that god is a real creator and that matter is his real creation; the sense of delusion or illusion" is para- 

mount. 

(b) NATURE 

While, however, one side of the teaching of the Upanisads develops in this brilliant manner, and in the hands of Gauḍapada and Śankara emerges as the chef d'œuvre of the Indian philosophical intellect, another and important scheme of philosophy was growing up, and was destined to exhibit itself, at a period not far distant from the close of the great Upanisads, in a living and effective form. The existence of this system as the definite Samkhya of the classical period is not attested until comparatively late: the oldest text-book, the Samkhya Kārikā, may be assigned to about the fourth century A. D.," and for the earlier form of the system we are reduced to conjectures built on that text, the history of the parallel system of Yoga, and the indications of the epic, which knows well the Samkhya and Yoga systenis, but which in regard to its date is so uncertain, that it does not necessarily afford us any information older than that contained in, and to be inferred from, the

• Schayer's effort (cf. also pp. 42 f.) to establish the doctrine that Māyā is a free creation, not an illusion, is as ingenious as it is unconvincing. There is no evidence that the idea of illusion was unknown to India in connexion with a juggler's work (contrast the stories given ibid. pp. 53), and the 

synonyms of Maya include such as Gandharvanagara. The idea of Māyā is akin to the product of the juggler in the Ratnavali who conjures up the appearance of a fire, into which the king rushes, whereas none exists. Cf. Asanga's account in the Sūtrālam- kāra, as given by Schayer himself (ZII. ii. 103-5), which is perfectly clear as to the unreality of Māyā. 

7 A later date is usually given (cf. Garbe, Samkhya und Yoga, p. 7), but the earlier date is now the most probable; see Winternitz, Gesch. d. ind. Lit. ii. 256; iii. 452 f.

Samkhya Kārikā itself. Very briefly put,' the classical Samkhya system discards entirely the idea of an absolute: it reduces the universe to a multi- tude of individual subjects, which have nothing true about them save their subjectivity, a subjectivity which has no creative power and is not properly realized at all by having an objective content. On the contrary, it is only by error in any way connected with the existing world, through its fancied con- nexion with Prakṛti, nature'. Through the development of Prakṛti there arises the principle called the great one or intellect, Mahan or Buddhi: the Prakṛti is, therefore, to be regarded as purely unconscious, a conception vaguely analogous to the Aristotelian Hyle, and connected, directly as it would seem, with the older views of the Rigveda and the Brahmanas as to the primitive condition of the universe as a chaos. The development of con- sciousness must therefore, it would appear, be cosmic, and the Mahan or Buddhi would thus correspond to the Hiranyagarbha of the later Upanisads and the Vedanta, the spirit which, in the earlier view, appeared on the waters after the creation of the waters by Prajapati or the Brahman. But at the same time the Buddhi is the first element of the subtle body, the Liñga, which is the essence of the individual spirit, and which passes through trans- migration. The Buddhi serves as the basis for the development of the prin- ciple of individualism, Ahamkara, from which are derived on the one hand the mind and the ten organs-or rather potentialities or faculties of sense, five of perception, and five of action, and on the other hand the subtle elements, from which in their turn come the gross clements, though an epic variant gives in lieu the elements and the objects of sense, sound, &c.2 The Linga, which is perhaps most appropriately called the 'psychic apparatus', contains in itself all the elements down to the subtle elements, and even of the gross elements it has the fine parts, and it is through it that the individual subject experiences -or rather seems to experience-the facts of this world. The experience is painful and unhappy, even though alleviated by the joys of earth, and the real aim of life is to be rid of the connexion with nature. But that connexion does not really exist: it is only thought to exist by an error and, when this error of ignorance is removed, then the connexion is seen not to exist and ceases to exist, the subject being freed from any connexion with an object, and on the other hand, the Prakṛti is freed from any pain or trouble, since being absolutely unconscious in the absence of subject there is no possibility of its suffering or enjoying anything. Strictly speaking, therefore, the spirit is never troubled In the main I agree with Deussen (Gesch. * Deussen, Gesch. der Phil. I. iii. 497. This 

der Phil. I. iii) when he departs from the views of Garbe (Samkhya-Philoso- phie and Samkhya und Yoga). account of Deussen in the Phil. of Up. is slightly inaccurate. Cf. my Sáṁkhya System (1918, 2nd ed. 1924). Berndl's reconstruction (Über das Samkhya) is clearly unhistorical; see below.

The Philosophy of the Veda 

[Part V 

or suffers anything or enjoys anything: it merely illumines nature, which accordingly suffers, but is set free by the cessation of illumination. But the difference of the result in the two cases is enormous: the subject by ceasing to have an object is emancipated for all time, the Prakṛti in that one case is delivered, but that is a matter of indifference since the infinite number of other souls means that Prakṛti is ever being unrolled for the gaze of the subject and ever is suffering. 

The whole theory is one mass of difficult paradoxes, despite its seeming elegance and simplicity of structure. The main basis of the conception, that there is suffering through the connexion of the soul with nature, is contra- dicted by the fact that there is really no connexion: the suffering is pro- duced by a connexion which does not exist, and is only imagined to exist, but an imagined connexion is no ground for results which a real connexion alone could produce. The relation of the one Prakṛti with the psychical apparatuses which are not conscious except under the illumination of the subject is never clearly explained, or perhaps understood.1 At best we may endeavour to conceive the position that the connexion-which, however, as we have seen, is not really existent of the spirit with Prakṛti, as a single undifferen- tiated unit, produces a primal consciousness (Buddhi), which develops under the influence of the individuation (Ahamkara) of the spirit an individual form or psychic apparatus, on which is based the life of the individual. In that case the conception of a cosmic development of individuation and the other things would be in the main a mistaken complement of the system which is not essential to it. But there is the grave objection to this theory that already in the Samkhya Karika the paternal and maternal portions of the gross elements are supposed by the author to fall back into and be picked up out of Prakṛti by the psychic apparatus in the case of death and rebirth, and not as would be logical and proper, if the development of Prakṛti were individual from the point of Buddhi onwards, recalled into and evolved from the subtle clements, while the Prabhūtas, which represent the material world, are made to stand over against the selves as an independent real world. 

It is, however, unnecessary to consider further the contradictions of the Samkhya, and it is only requisite to note that in the nature of Prakṛti there is supposed to be contained a triad of constituent factors, Guṇas, literally 'threads' rather than determinant qualities', which in the passive condition of Prakṛti are in a quiescent state of equilibrium, but which in the process of evolution develop differently in the several psychic apparatuses, producing, therefore, the very varied characters of men and of life. These factors are Sattva, the light, the intellectual principle, Rajas, the active and emotional principle, and Tamas, the dark and gloomy principle. The terms are wholly indefinite and unphilosophical, and the use made of them in practice is mainly 

1 Cf. Oltramare, L'histoire des idées théoso- phiques, i. 261 ff. Jacobi's account (Die Entwicklung der Gottesidee bei

psychical, whereas, as constituents of Prakṛti, they ought to have received. some different cosmic sense, such as that of conditional being, energy, and inertia, suggested by Hopkins. Their importance in the system, however, cannot be underestimated, and it is significant that, while Śañkara rejects definitely the validity of these principles, they are accepted by the later school of Vedanta and interwoven with the Vedanta philosophy." 

(c) THE ORIGIN OF THE SAṀKHYA AND BUDDHISM 

The question inevitably arises in what manner these views are to be con- nected with those of the Upanisads,3 and the further problem must be men- tioned of the origin of Buddhism, which has been traced to the Samkhya. The Buddhist system differs in one essential from the Samkhya: it abolishes, as does that system, the principle of an absolute, with which the individual souls are identified, and it goes further than that system in seeking to deny the existence of soul. The latter aberration need not, however, be taken very seriously the Buddhists, being determined believers in transmigration, had to produce an entity which would transmigrate; the entity provided does not differ, in any very essential way, from the ordinary view in India of a transmigrating soul, and certainly is philosophically inferior to the ordinary conception, unsatisfactory as that in itself is. 

4 

No Upanisad attains the point of view of the Sāṁkhya system, and it is therefore only possible to indicate the mode in which the conception of the absolute tended to fade away and to leave the individual spirits confronted with nature. The essential feature of the Samkhya is the evolutionary series, and the name Samkhya, 'examination', 'calculation', or 'description by enumeration of constituents 2,5 rather than a mere counting, suggests that the philosophy owed its importance to its insistence on the principle of careful examination of the clements of the process of development from the absolute. Now in the Upanisads the first case in which the order of evolution from the absolute is stated with precision-even then incomplete is in the Katha Upanisad, where we find that in the carrying out of meditation, Yoga, in order to reach the absolute, the objects are merged in the senses, the senses in the mind, the mind in the intellect, Buddhi, the intellect in the great self,

The alternative view that the Samkhya is of independent origin, based on an independent analysis of consciousness, and that the Katha represents a compromise may be men- tioned (cf. Oltramare, L'histoire des idées théosophiques, i. 221 ff., for a critique of Garbe's view on this point). But it is not possible to ignore the obvious fact that the Purusa of the Samkhya is merely the Atman made many.

[Part V 

which is also then merged in the undiscriminated, Avyakta, described as the calm self, and that again in the spirit, Puruṣa, which is the absolute. The similitude of these views to the series of development of the Samkhya is obvious the separation of the Mahan Atmā, the great self, and Buddhi is a distinction which it is difficult to appreciate in the Katha and would naturally disappear on further reflection, with the abandonment of a cosmic Atman, while the interposition of the undiscriminated, which corresponds to the position of the old primitive material or waters of the Brahmanas, between the spirit and the intellect, corresponds also precisely to the position of Prakṛti in the Samkhya system, except for the fact that the Katha is still monistic, and still regards the spirit as an absolute, whence nature is derived, the individual spirit being identified more or less clearly with the highest spirit. But it must have been an obvious, if no less a very important, step when it was decided by some thinker that there was no necessity to imagine the unity of all the spirits in one. Ex hypothesi the spirits were all identical with the one spirit, and, therefore, each must have the same creative power to produce the undiscriminated as the supreme spirit. To what end then to feign a supreme spirit? Moreover, from another point of view the postulating of a supreme spirit would appear unsound: the enormous variety of individual experience of life, the plain facts of every-day existence, show that there is not one spirit merely but many.1 The theory of unity of all spirits is difficult and con- fusing, and the obvious refuge from these difficulties is to admit that each spirit is a separate entity. The relation of the spirits and Prakṛti would follow at once, when this was accepted: the doctrine of Yajñavalkya was clear that the self was merely the knowing subject: clearly, therefore, as the self was the subject only, Prakṛti cannot be produced from the spirit in any material sense it is the independent object merely of spirit.2 

It is important to note the real similarity between the self in the view of the Yajnavalkya of the Bṛhadaraṇyaka Upanisad and that of the Samkhya; both are absolutely without quality or activity, completely inactive, the capacity of knowing without content; both, we may fairly say, represent bare abstractions which could never as such be real. If the self of Yajnavalkya is wholly apart from empirical existence and knowledge, the same thing really applies to the spirit of the Samkhya, for it is not really in contact with matter. In the Buddhism of the Sarvāstivādins we find the same view of Vijñāna, which remains wholly apart from real connexion with the object, being, like it, merely a momentary flashing wholly transitory and uncaused. Naturally in all three cases some effort must be made to explain the connexion of this 

1 Cf. Samkhya Kārikā 18. 

2 The Atman in KU.iii. 3 f. is the lord of the 

chariot, who is essentially a mere spectator, for intellect is the driver, mind the reins, and the senses the horses. The absence of the Ahamkara in KU. can hardly be accidental as 

Oldenberg (op. cit., p. 231) suggests. For its frequent omission in the epic, see Hopkins, Great Epic of India, p. 183.

subjectivity and the object which makes its potentiality concrete knowledge, and equally naturally at this point in all three systems we have a lacuna, which is filled up by unintelligible assertions, the Buddhists resorting to a relation of Sārūpya, 'co-ordination' or 'co-relation', which is found also in the Yogabhāṣya 1 of Vyāsa as the mode of bridging over the gulf between knower and knowledge. 

If we seek to find in the older Upaniṣads a more direct connexion with the doctrines of the Samkhya than the conception of the self in Yājñavalkya, then the most obvious parallel, in addition to the scheme of evolution in the Katha, is the passage in the Kauṣitaki Upanisad 2 in which a list of ten senses is opposed to a corresponding number of objects, and the presence of intellect, Prajñā, is said to be essential for every kind of sense-knowledge, including the activity of mind in respect of thought and desire. We have here the prototype of the curious feature in the Samkhya of the senses and mind as alike only potential until reflected in some manner in Puruṣa. The more common idea of the senses being powerless without mind lies doubtless at the back of this more advanced conception, a fact which illustrates the remarkable dependence of the Samkhya on older ideas. 

A certain degree of parallelism to the Katha evolution series is present in doctrine of the mode in which on death according to the Chandogya Upanisad speech (the eye, the car, and the other organs are presumably here typified by speech) enters the mind, the mind the breath, the breath the brilliance of fire (the other two elements of the Chandogya, water and earth, may be included), and that the supreme deity. In deep sleep, again, we have a series in the PraŚna Upanisad 3 where we may understand that the five gross, the five subtle, elements, the organs of sense, all enter the mind, it the intellect, it individuation, it thought, it brilliance, it breath, and it the self, but this latter passage is too vague to be of much importance save as showing how prevalent were these efforts to find the order of evolution. 

In the Mundaka Upanisad 5 we find an expression of the order of develop- ment commencing from the absolute, as all-knowing, the second element being food, an expression perhaps for the undiscriminated, the coming breath, which may correspond with Hiranyagarbha, mind, truth, the worlds, and actions. The more precise similarity of the doctrine of the Mundaka to that of the Katha is maintained by Hertel,' who has endeavoured to reconstruct an original text of this Upanisad by conjecture from that which, as he holds, based on a single manuscript which was far from correct, has been preserved

According to Oldenberg (Die Lehre der Upanishaden, p. 226, n. 1) it means "das Ichmachen," d. h. das Ichsagen und Betātigen der Ichheit,' rather than *der Ichmacher'. The genesis of this

entity may be connected with the speculations of the Upanisads on deep sleep, in which individuality disappears; Heimann, Die Tiefschlafspekulation der alten Upanisaden (1922), pp. 13 f. i. 1. 8, 9; ii. 1. 2, 8.

to us by Śankara. Reconstructions of this kind seldom permit of any satis- factory result to others than their author, and there is always the fundamental difficulty, apart from minor points, whether the incoherence of thought which gives rise to the reconstruction is not, as most probably in the case of the Bhagavadgītā, due to the author, and not the result of interpolation. If, however, we omit the whole of ii. 2, and iii. 1. 4-10 and 2. 8 and 9, we obtain the doctrine that, as in the Skambha hymn of the Atharvaveda,1 which affords part of the material of the Upanisad, the highest thing in the world is regarded as personal, from which there emanates the Brahman and whatever else exists. On this view the ultimate fate of the soul on its return is not absorp- tion in the Brahman but union with Purusa, the world of Brahman serving merely as the place of those who fully perform the sacrificial ritual in the mode approved by the Mundaka. The other portions, however, of the text, which cannot with any assurance be ascribed to working over, definitely identify the highest principle with the Brahman, adopting the regular identification of the Brahman and the Atman, and treating the final result to be aimed at as the recognition of the identity of the Brahman and the Atman. Moreover, even in the verses which are spared by Hertel, we find hints contradicting his theory of a simple doctrine; thus in i. 1. 7 all is stated to arise from the imperishable (akṣara), while in ii. 1. 2 we find the personal highest being declared to be above the imperishable, and in ii. 1. 10 the Brahman and Puruṣa are directly identified, unless we hold with Hertel that there is a lacuna in the text for which we have no other ground. It is significant also that the interpolator has to be credited with iii. 2. 3, which adopts the Katha doctrine of salvation by the favour of the lord, so that we have to assume that, on the one hand, he altered the personal aspect of the Upanisad by insisting on the primacy of the impersonal Brahman, while, on the other, he deliberately added one of the most personal touches in the shape of the doctrine of grace. This is plainly incredible, and we may safely assume that, while the author worked on an older idea of a personal prius as in the Atharvaveda, and accepted the doctrine of grace from the Katha, he himself adopted the Brahman standpoint.3 The resemblance of the Maitrāyaṇīya Upaniṣad to the Samkhya is of a

To certain of Hertel's metrical views the strongest exception must be taken. To carry out his rule that the first syllable of a dissyllabic, and the second of a trisyllabic, middle part of the Triṣṭubh is short he has to argue for oṣadhyaḥ, purāstād, paramaṁ (sāmyam) as two shorts, suriasya, kavayo yanti, and agràhyam; he turns -āni and -eṣu into single final syllables, and postulates a great number of quite impossible elisions of short vowels. These, added 

to text alterations, enable him to reform the metre, but they do not justify his severe censure of Deussen for his perfectly just strictures on the metre of the text as we have it. Every metrical irregularity could thus be removed from any text, and Hertel's procedure is specially inconsistent, since he objects to alteration of Prakritic irregularities in grammar, which might equally well be changed, if the Upanisad is to be rewritten. But metre may be excused in a philosopher. Cf. E. A. Welden, AJP. xxxv. 32 ff.

different character from that of the Katha; it is due in all likelihood to direct Samkhya influence at a much later date. In this Upanisad we find an answer attempted to the question why and how the absolute self enters the world and appears in individual form. Prajapati, existing alone, had no joy; therefore he created offspring as inanimate, and to enjoy them he enters with the breaths into them, thus animating them, and then by means of the organs of sense and action and the mind he has joy of them. But the absolute self, Prajapati, remains wholly unaffected, though an apparent actor; action actually belongs to the Bhūtātman, or clemental soul, which overcome by the fruits of action passes to a good or evil birth, and is merged in existence, while the true self remains unaffected like the drop of water on a lotus leaf. The clemental soul is overcome by the qualities or factors of nature, Prakṛti, and thus conceives the erroneous impression of individuality; thinking This is I' and 'That is mine' he binds himself as a bird with a snare.1 But the pure self is not without responsibility for this evil state, for a definite though obscure statement attributes it to the fact that the elemental self is overpowered by the inner Purusa. The composite character of the text reveals itself in the further con- ception of the self as the enjoyer, while the elemental soul is made out to be the body, which it enjoys. We find also the three factors named and described at length, essentially as psychic, and Prajapati as affected by Sattva, goodness, as a factor is equated with Visṇu, as affected by Rajas, activity, with Brahman, and as affected with Tamas, dullness, with Rudra. It is characteristic that the Upanisad shows equally knowledge of the development of Yoga doctrine, though its scheme of stages of exercises has six in lieu of the classical cight." Further, it is markedly pessimistic, the evils of empirical existence being set out with an elaboration of comparison and detail such as is only to be paralleled in the Buddhist texts, which it doubtless knew in some early form. It shows an advanced psychology, for it recognizes the function of individuation, though not as in the Samkhya in its classical form, as placed between intellect and mind and as the source of the latter, but as following on mind and intellect, without any assertion of derivation, and it conceives of the existence of the subtle body, or Linga, though it is not clear whether it actually asserts that the Linga possesses not merely the fine elements but also the gross elements as part of its composition.5 Moreover, the question is actually posed whether it is merely the factors that are really subject to bondage, or the self; the classical Samkhya asserts definitely, though not always consistently, that the self is not really bound, but this is not the view accepted by the Upanisad, which insists on the bondage of the self, exhibited in the actions of intellect, mind, and individuation, and promises release when the sense organs, mind, and intellect have ceased to function."

The Philosophy of the Veda 

[Part V 

For the doctrine of the Gunas or factors there is obvious a parallel in the CvetaŚvatara Upanisad,1 which has on the ground of its content often been needlessly supposed to postdate the Samkhya system, a view which cannot be supported on any cogent ground. In it, we are told, that one she-goat, red, white, and black in hue, produces many young like herself: one he-goat leaps on her in love, the other abandons her, after associating with her. The idea of the relation of nature to the many spirits seems obviously expressed in this metaphor. But it is clear that the red, white, and black colours carry us beyond doubt to the Chandogya Upanisad, where everything in the universe is declared to be connected with the three elements, the red of fire, the white of water, and the black of food, probably an allusion to earth, this being the order of creation when the absolute first produced heat, thence water, then earth, in the shape of food. It is not necessary to suppose that in the ŚvetāŚvatara there is anything more meant than the three elements: the transformation of these to psychic forces, which is prominent in the Saṁkhya, though the other conception is implied in the ascription of the three to Prakṛti, would then be a later development, which in the Upanisads occurs first in the Maitrāyaṇīya.1 

It is clear, therefore, that the seeds of the Samkhya lie in the philosophy of the Upanisads: the conception of the deliverance from the round of rebirth and misery is wholly absurd on the Samkhya theory of the universe, which denies any real connexion of spirit and nature, and, therefore, makes any suffering impossible, since without connexion there is no illumination, and without illumination of nature by spirit no suffering of any kind. In the doctrine of Maya there is an illusion which is perfectly real though an illusion, and knowledge can dispel it and its products. But the ignorance which must be dispelled in the Samkhya is the belief in a connexion which does not exist, and the Samkhya philosophy never suggests that the misery of the universe is due to the belief: it is only possible because of the connexion: ignorance does not produce the connexion: therefore logically there is no misery. The mere fact of this illogicality alone and the marked pessimism of the system would testify to its derivative character. 

6 

A somewhat divergent view of the development of the Samkhya is suggested by Dahlmann, who in several works has insisted on the view that

2 Hopkins (JAOS. xxii. 380-7) insists that sāmkhyayogādhigumyam in vi. 13 must refer to the system of the epic Samkhya- Yoga, but this is not in the least proved; see Deussen, Gesch. der Phil. I. iii. 15. Morcover it is difficult to reconcile Hopkins' view with his date of the 4th cent. (ibid. p. 336) for this Upanisad. Kapila in v. 2 is clearly mythical (cf. iv. 12), not the teacher.

This leads Speyer (Indische Theosophie, p. 113) to the conjecture that an originally materialistic system has been trans- formed in an external method idealis- tically. But this theory rests on no solid basis and ignores the essential link of connexion with the Upaniṣads. So with Jacobi, Festschrift Kuhn, pp. 37 ff., and Berndl, Über das Samkhya. For a later view of Jacobi, see below.

The Origin of the Samkhya 

541 

the epic reveals to us the oldest stage of the Samkhya philosophy and not as maintained by Hopkins,1 and in some degree 2 Deussen among others, an eclectic philosophical view. Dahlmann's position is obscured by its connexion with his ingenious but unsuccessful effort to prove that the epic is in itself a unity consciously produced at a period before Panini, a thesis which rests on absolutely no cogent or even plausible evidence. Nor have we any tolerable ground for the view that the system of Samkhya as first evolved under that name was other than atheistic, in the sense not merely of denying an İŚvara which in a degree Dahlmann would admit, but also of denying an absolute. Further, it is most natural to hold that the Samkhya-Yoga of the epic is a definite theistic modification of the Samkhya, which is more really theistic and absolutist than the later Yoga, in which as a system attention is directed towards the Yoga practices and not so largely to the theistic aspect. But the rejection of Dahlmann's theories in these respects does not deprive of value his theory of the development of Indian philosophy. He argues that the first stage must be looked for in a view which is in close touch with the expres- sions of the Brāhmaṇas as to the process of creation, in which there is more or less consciously assumed to be some material beyond the actual creator, and he points out that in the early speculations of the Upanisads we learn of the Atman on the one hand, but also of what is not the Atman, which is full of misery. In more philosophic form this appears as the doctrine of the Brahman, beside which stands Prakṛti, into which is emptied the whole of the ordinary world of thought and action, while the Brahman remains outside all contact with thought, affording the end, Nirvana, which is to be attained by the extinguishing of all kinds of feeling, by the negation of everything empirical. From this dualistic basis he deduces on the one hand the Samkhya and on the other the Vedanta of the illusionist school. The former view is arrived at by a determined effort to make logical the process of development in final release it became intolerable to contemplate that there was really only one Atman, which, by connexion in some unexplained way with Prakṛti, produced the innumerable separate spirits through the action of Buddhi and of Aham- kāra, since release became meaningless, and it, therefore, assumed that there were innumerable Atmans, whose derivation from the primitive Atman was proved by the fact that they retained the characteristics of omnipresence and infinity, which belong properly only to the one Atman and which, applied to all, lead to absurdity. On the other hand, the Vedantins laid such stress on the unity of the universe that they denied the existence as real of Prakṛti, contenting themselves with the idle doctrine of illusion, which was clearly inconsistent with their own principle of unity. Moreover, he argues, materialism was a natural product of the carly view, since it really emptied

The Philosophy of the Veda 

[Part V 

the Atman of all empirical reality, and gave such reality to Prakṛti, and thus encouraged the view that matter by itself was able to produce the universe, while on the other hand by its subjectivism in the doctrine of the Atman encouragement was given to scepticism, and finally to the philosophic in- difference of carly Buddhism. 

Apart from the fact that there is really no good ground for calling the first stage Samkhya,1 and that the denial of illusionism cannot be accepted as absolutely true of the Upanisads, Dahlmann's theory has the merit of directing attention to a real aspect of the philosophy of the Upanisads and the epic : there is a real affinity between the process by which Buddhi and Ahamkāra are deemed to produce the world of experience and the older myths of Prajā- pati and his desire, Kama, as playing their parts in the creation of the world, while still further back we have the picture of Puruṣa as at once the material and the spiritual source of the world. But it would be a mistake to accept the view that the aspect insisted upon by Dahlmann was really either the sole aspect or the chief aspect of philosophy in the period of the later Upanisads. In particular Dahlman goes clearly too far in stressing the independent character of the evolution of Prakṛti, and in his insistence on the nature of IŚvara as the world soul arising from Prakṛti alone, thus placing Prakṛti beside the Atman as in itself accounting for the whole of the empirical world. It must never be forgotten, as Dahlmann himself elsewhere 2 recognizes, that the spiritual side of existence is essentially conditioned by the fact that in Prakṛti the Atman is present as the observer, a fact which in the Samkhya is preserved and emphasized in the insistence on the doctrine that but for the connexion of Puruṣa and Prakṛti there would be no cognition or feeling of any kind. When due weight is accorded to this fact, we reach fairly closely to a concep- tion which is not far different from that of Badarayana as the normal, not unique, doctrine of the Upanisads: there is an absolute on which matter is dependent indeed, but not illusory, and individual souls which in the Upani- ṣads, but not in the Brahma Sutra, at the end are resolved into the absolute, but which are not in themselves illusory, being, we may assume, the necessary result of the coexistence of the absolute and matter, and therefore endowed, until united with the absolute through knowledge, with a certain relative but real independence.3 

The real question is in a sense whether we can legitimately call Samkhya a system which accepts an absolute, and differs from the normal Upanisad doctrine essentially in the attention given to derivation from the absolute of Prakrti and individuals. The best defence of this suggestion is that of Olden- berg, who faces the fundamental difficulty that a system with an absolute in 

4 

1 Oldenberg (Die Kultur der Gegenwart, 

I. v. 34) does not deny the possibility of this view; cf. Buddha, p. 68, n. 1. 2 Dic Samkhya-Philosophie, pp. 80 ff., where he tends to exaggerate, as usual, the Prakṛti side of the compound Jiva. 

Cf. also Deussen, Gesch. der Phil. I. iii. 

259 ff. Oldenberg, Die Lehre der Upanishaden, pp. 206-58, who accepts an epic Samkhya with an absolute as explain- ing Buddhism (GN. 1917, pp. 218 ff.). 

Chap. 28] 

The Origin of the Samkhya 

543 

the epic is not normally Samkhya, and that the twenty-five principles of the Samkhya of the epic seem in their correspondence with the classical school to negate the presence among them of the absolute. Oldenberg's suggestion, that the twenty-fifth principle includes both the absolute and its manifesta- tions as individual, is ingenious, but hardly convincing, and as a matter of terminology and historic fact it seems unwise to employ the term Sāṁkhya as applicable to any system which acknowledges an absolute. The facts of the derivation of the Samkhya above accepted are, of course, not affected by the question of terminology, and in view of the extremely composite nature of epic philosophy we need not be in the least surprised to find a conglomerate of this side of Aupaniṣada views with genuine Samkhya, and the blend which the epic knows as Samkhya-Yoga, and which has the somewhat unfortunate appearance of an effort to reconcile the Upanisads and the Samkhya. 

An interesting and ingenious effort, however, has been made by Professor Edgerton1 to establish the doctrine that the epic knows nothing of a Samkhya which denies the world soul or an IŚvara, and that in it Samkhya and Yoga do not denote philosophical systems but means of realizing that unity with the world soul, which is the aim of all philosophy in this period which is not materialistic. Samkhya denotes simply reflection-doubtless its primary meaning and Yoga practical exercises tending to produce the unity desired, the details in the Mokṣadharma showing that a sort of self-hypnosis is aimed at, while in the Gita the method is that of unselfish normal activity in the position of life in which fate has placed a man. Ingenious as this effort is, the denial of a specific Samkhya doctrine appears, on the whole, untenable. It compels us in the passage xii. 11037 ff. to render the words aniŚvaraḥ katham mucyet as 'how the soul may be saved', and to hold that in this passage no distinction is being drawn between the views of Samkhya and Yoga, which is to put an intolerable strain upon the language.2 Nor does it seem possible in xii. 11408 to render aniŚvaram applied to the twenty-fifth principle merely as supreme'; the term iŚvara in the preceding verse makes it clear that a contrast is intended. Another reference to the distinctive Samkhya insistence on a multitude of spirits must be seen in xii. 11488,4 and the whole matter appears clearly from xii. 13713 ff. In this passage we find two very distinct views set out the Samkhya and the Yoga accept a multiplicity of souls, while Vyasa insists that all the souls at bottom rest on the world soul. To endeavour 5 to explain away this obvious distinction by the theory that the real distinction is between a full and a brief exposition, and not between the views of Kapila and others and of Vyāsa, is as unsatisfactory as the suggestion that adhyātma in the description of Kapila's activities means that he took thought on the supreme soul; the reference is clearly to the soul only. Nor is there anything

out of place1 in the allusion to the Yoga, for on the score of the multiplicity of souls Samkhya and Yoga in their classical forms agree. The effort also to remove the significance of the addition of a twenty-sixth principle in the Yoga on the score that, as Oldenberg suggested, the new head serves merely to distinguish the souls as released, is clearly a tour de force; the twenty-sixth is IŚvara, with whom, indeed, the enlightened soul may be identified.3

In the very different view of Berndl the Sāṁkhya system, as we have it in the Kārikā of IŚvarakṛṣṇa and later, is a serious deviation from the true views of Kapila, who may have been the first teacher to express his views in prose. The original doctrine which denied any soul has been recast to meet Brahman prejudices, and has thus lost its definite character. Traces of the older view may be found in the assertion of the Mahabharata 5 which gives number and matter, Prakṛti, and twenty-four principles as the essence of the Samkhya. Originally the doctrine recognized only three Gunas, Charactere', whose interactions, themselves uncaused, since cause does not affect these things in themselves, produce the whole empirical world, which is ruled by absolute necessity. The Gunas are not material, but are capable of mutual attraction, repulsion, and experience, and their interaction results in the formation of complexes (Empfindungszentren), which are selves, but which true knowledge shows are not distinct, eternal, metaphysical entities. But each is conscious of its essential relation to the Gunas, and this is expressed, subjectively, in the consciousness of transcendence, and, objectively, in the will to live and to maintain one's individuality. Space is an abstraction made by the subject from the relations of things inter se and to itself, to which there corresponds only a manifold of heterogeneous sensations of quality, which the subject, by reason of the difference from its own homogeneity, experiences as something without. Time is also an abstraction made by the subject, to which alterations of external and internal conditions correspond, the ground for distinguishing them being their different characters, those without being many and cutting across one another, while those which are internal are individualized and unified. The suggestion is ingenious, but it is perfectly clear that it is unhistorical. To eliminate Purusas as an essential feature opposed to Prakṛti is to contradict everything we know of the Samkhya, and it is difficult to appreciate why the system should thus have been transformed, nor do the changes in the system of Empedokles made by Anaxagoras provide

79 ff.). 

The latter invented nous because the fact that the elements of Empedokles were conscious was forgotten, in Berndl's view. The view of Kapila was similarly altered, but illogically many selves were admitted, to avoid adopting the Vedanta view. But, while Anaxagoras was a pioneer as to nous, Kapila was a rebel against the Brahman soul doc- trine, which ruins the alleged parallel. 

Chap. 28] 

The Origin of the Samkhya

an adequate parallel. It is necessary also in Berndl's view to deny the doctrine of necessary periodical destruction of the universe, since all that is requisite is that, since things have originated, they cannot be permanent, and to question the early character of the marked pessimism of the Kārikā as incon- sistent with the date of 700 or 800 B.C. ascribed to Kapila. 

A different view of the relation of the Upanisads and the Samkhya is presented by Professor Jacobi,' whose latest view is that a distinct gulf lies between the older Upanisads, and the middle and younger groups, terms which denote the Kaṭha, IŚa, ŚvetāŚvatara, Mundaka and Mahānārāyaṇa, and the PraŚna, Maitrāyaṇīya, and Maṇḍūkya respectively. 

The middle group is 

marked out from the oldest group by the absence of Aranyaka characteristics, the fact that the thought of the Upanisads is no longer in the making but already expresses itself in characteristic verses and turns of phrase, and the metrical form, while, as Jacobi points out, there appears in the middle and younger groups a large number of technical terms of philosophical interest which are unknown to the earlier texts. In Jacobi's view there is also a vital philosophical difference between the two strata; the middle and younger Upanisads are composed under the direct influence of the Samkhya system which had come into being after the oldest Upanisads. The vital element in the new point of view is the manifestation of the belief in the doctrine of the personal immortality of the souls of men and other creatures conceived as monads or as a multiplicity of immaterial substances, this view being accom- panied by the clear distinction of what was material and what was immaterial. The souls of the Samkhya are derived, in his view, from the aspect of the self as composed of intelligence or consciousness (vijñānamaya) in the older Upanisads, but with the essential difference that the soul is no longer regarded as being derived from and merging on death into the Brahman. At the same time the being (sat) of the Chandogya Upanisad 2 with its three constituents, which in the Upanisad are regarded as living, is distinguished as purely material, and its constituents figure as the Gunas of the Samkhya, while the Buddhi of the Samkhya is a transformation of the vijñānaghana ātmā of Yajnavalkya, the whole somewhat bizarre conception being due to an effort at an early date to make a coherent system out of the confused thoughts of the oldest Upani- ṣads. This system was of influence, though it did not prove generally accept- able. The middle and younger Upanisad groups represent efforts to compro- mise between the Samkhya with its kindred Yoga, and the pantheistic spirit of the Upanisads, an effort continued in the Bhagavadgita and the philosophical parts of the Mahabharata, and finally resulting in the compro- mise of the Purāṇas. One doctrine, however, that of the personal immortality of the soul, became generally accepted, figuring in the Nyaya and VaiŚeṣika schools, the Vedanta of Badarāyaṇa, and even the Purva Mīmānsā, as well

The Philosophy of the Veda 

[Part V 

as in Jainism. In the latter case the conception both of soul and matter seems to have been developed contemporaneously with the Samkhya views, though it is probable that the idea of the soul as essentially pure intelligence and immortal was taken over by the Jains from some other doctrine, much of primitive hylozoism clinging to their view of the soul. 

C 

This view has been accepted as regards the origin of the theory of soul by Prof. Stcherbatsky,1 who holds that the fact that the theory was few was the ground why it was so bitterly assailed by the Buddhists. He admits that the idea of a surviving personality is not unknown in the Veda, and that its essence and its relation to the Brahman are the main topic of discussion in the Upanisads. But this self is a psychological entity, different explanations of its nature are proposed, and materialistic views are not excluded.2 The idea of an immortal soul in our sense, a spiritual monad, a simple, uncomposite, eternal, immaterial substance is quite unknown in the Veda inclusive of the older Upanisads.' Most regrettably neither Prof. Jacobi nor Prof. Stcher- batsky has pointed out the passages in the middle or younger Upanisads in which this new idea of an immortal soul is to be found, as contrasted with those in the older Upanisads; and it appears to me wholly impossible to find any such distinction as real. The idea that at this period in the history of Indian thought the conception of an immortal soul was first introduced appears wholly without warrant, and to misunderstand entirely the course of development of Indian philosophy. 

The fact, of course, is that the primitive Vedic belief clung to the doctrine of the survival of something after death, and that, therefore, immortality was no new idea. The view as to what survived was as hazy as it is to-day in popular and philosophic thought alike, for then, as now, it was practically impossible to form any intelligible conception of what a soul is, for such a description of the modern view as that given by Prof. Stcherbatsky cannot be said to have any intelligible meaning. But superinduced on this simple view we have the philosophic doctrine passed off under the name of Yajnavalkya, which asserts that the soul is not, as the ordinary man thinks, independent; it is only a part of a greater whole or more accurately an aspect of that whole, so that at death there is no separate existence in the sense of personal im- mortality. That this view was ever generally accepted in philosophic circles is not suggested in the older Upanisads, and the middle and younger Upanisads show that it was not attractive and that the tendency was to consider the matter more theistically, the absolute taking on a definitely personal appear- ance and less stress being laid on merger in it, though it is essential to note that merger remains as a doctrine alongside with the contemplation of continued existence. But there is not the slightest trace of the advent of 

The Central Conception of Buddhism (1923), 

pp. 69 ff. 

That such views are allowed in the older Upanisads seems an error, perhaps 

based on Jacobi's older suggestion of materialism in CU. vi, which seems tacitly revised in op. cit., pp. 11 f. 

Chap. 28] The Origin of the Samkhya and Buddhism 

547 

personal immortality or the spiritual nature of the soul as new ideas in the period of the middle Upanisads; the soul there remains a psychological entity exactly to the same extent as it was such an entity in the older Upanisads. 

Prof. Stcherbatsky, however, maintains that the old and the new soul theories were clearly distinguished; thus all Buddhists rejected the doctrine of a self corresponding to the psycho-physical individual, Atmavāda, but the Vātsiputriyas and Sammitiyas accepted the theory of the doctrine of per- manent soul, Pudgalavada. This basis of distinction, however, is clearly illegitimate, and is not given by the Buddhist texts; instead the Pudgala is clearly a self corresponding to the psycho-physical individual, since it is main- tained that it assumes new elements at birth and throws them off at death,1 and the other Buddhist schools justly rejected either doctrine, seeing through the subterfuge by which these two schools endeavoured, while evading direct contradiction of the master's insistence on Anatta, negation of a self, to preserve the existence of something which could transmigrate, thus preserving the reality of the doctrine of moral retribution, which utterly disappears in the ordinary conception of Buddhism.2 Nor is there any plausibility in the view that the Kaṭha Upanisad already recognizes what Prof. Stcherbatsky- on dubious grounds-claims to be the fundamental doctrine of Buddhism, the existence of Dharmas conceived as a plurality of subtle, ultimate, not further analysable elements of matter, mind, and force. The theory is based on the fact that in that Upanisad (iv. 14) we find a condemnation of him who sees Dharmas separately (prthag dharmān paŚyati), which is a very different thing from Stcherbatsky's rendering 'maintains the existence of separate elements'. The idea that Dharmas in this passage are 'elements' is as implausible as that the term Dharma in i. 21 has this sense; the word seems to mean in both instances something like thing' as taken by Geiger,3 and this use harmonizes with dharmya as opposed to what is subtle (anu) in ii. 13, a passage ignored by Stcherbatsky. With this rendering disappears wholly the idea that the author of the Katha is directing a polemic against a doctrine which denies both the old and the new theorics of the soul, or that Dharma is a catchword referring to a new and foreign doctrine, some anatma-dharma theory'. Nor is there the slightest justification for the view that Panini is aware of Buddhist and Samkhya views of causation, for his explanation of the use

Pāṇini's knowledge would be increased if we accepted Charpentier's claim (ZII. ii. 140 ff.) that he lived not later than 550 B.C., since he knew the title of Kamboja King, which was extinct after the death of Kambyses (= Kam- boja King, title of older Achaime- nidai). But this rests on a number of conjectures, all unproved and all most implausible. 

548 

The Philosophy of the Veda 

[Part V 

of samskṛta and upakṛta or upaskṛta corresponds very poorly with this suggestion. 

Stcherbatsky 1 suggests further that from the Samkhya the Buddhists derived the incentive to the doctrine of the world as consisting of momentary elements of mind, matter, and force. The Guṇas of the Samkhya on this view are interpreted as fundamental principles, matter, mind-stuff, and energy- stuff, acting as interdependent moments in every real and substantial exist- ence; the infinitesimals of energy, present everywhere, are semi-material; although different from the inertia of matter and the luminosity of mind, they are separate and substantial'. The Buddhist elements arc a reply to the Samkhya by an architect of greater skill. Ingenious as this theory is, it depends, even if we accept the suggested view of the Buddhist Dharmas as primitive-which seems impossible on the belief that the interpretation of the Gunas adopted is really that of the early Samkhya. This seems frankly impossible in view of the silence of the Samkhya texts and of the epic alike. The interpretation is based on the Yogabhaṣya of Vyasa, who is a compara- tively late author, and who shows every sign of influence by the Buddhist schools. To substitute his views for those of the origin of the Samkhya is as unwise as to adopt the doctrines of the Sarvāstivādins, as expounded by Vasu- bandhu, as representing the early doctrines of Buddhism from a philosophical point of view. The same error marks the suggestion that the name of Samkhya is borrowed from Samkhya in the sense of Prajña, that intellectual insight which destroys the infections (kleŚas), through which the spirit is bound to con- tinued existence. There can be no question that the epic explanation of the term as Parisamkhyāna, enumeration (of principles)', is to be preferred to this suggestion, though it is still more probable that in its earliest stage the term simply referred to reasoning.

Cf. Woods, Yoga-System of Patanjali, pp. xx f. His reasoning (p. xxi) that the comm. is after A.D. 650 because it is cited by Magha is clearly a slip; Magha knew it apparently and so it dates before A. D. 700. Dasgupta's (Ind. Phil. i. 230 ff.) early date for Patanjali as identical with the grammarian is implausible in the extreme.

The idea that the Samkhya did not recognize substance and quality in a relation of inherence (ibid., p. 27, n. 2) is clearly impossible, and is not even Vyasa's view.

seeks to show that the name refers to number, not of principles, but of the Gunas as transcendent realities. 

• See Hopkins, Great Epic of India, pp. 126 f. Thus Samkhya indicates a stage of definition prior to the VaiŚesika, which defines by special difference (viŚeṣa). In lieuit gives a description with enumera- tion of contents. The term Yoga, however, when used with Samkhya indicates the wider sense. It itself denotes the exertion which results in hypnosis, praxis as opposed to theory, but it assumes other shades of meaning, including the restraint of the senses (cf. Gūntert, Der arische Weltkönig, p. 225) and the joining of the spirit to that of IŚvara or an absolute. Cf. Keith, Samkhya System, chap. iv.

as a discipline by which the mind can be withdrawn from the things of this world and unity with the absolute can be attained, although it is only in the Katha, the CvetaŚvatara, and the much later Maitrāyaṇiya that these traces are of importance. The CvetaŚvatara, however, contributes an element which in the classical Yoga distinguishes it from the Samkhya, the presence of a personal deity, though the figure of the god in the Upanisad is infinitely more vivid and important than that of the IŚvara of the Yoga. This Upanisad, however, is distinctly marked by lack of clearness of conception, and attempts at harmonization of contrasting views. Recognizing the strength of the popular religion which craved for aid from the gods, and in no wise satisfied with mere Yoga methods of securing the end desired, the CvetāŚvatara intro- duces into its system the conception of god. But in this introduction we find a repeated confusion between god as an addition to the empiric universe beside matter and spirits, and god as identical with the absolute. In the first sense we have the conception of the absolute as comprehending the three; god, who is the knower, the inciter to enjoyment, the lord; spirit, the enjoyer, the ignorant, not the lord; and nature, which is to be enjoyed by each spirit according to its merit or demerit. Two birds there are dwelling in one tree, one eats the sweet fruit, the other merely gazes on the scene; one, spirit, is dis- tressed in contact with nature, but when it beholds the other, the lord, is freed from its woes. In the classical Yoga this picture presents itself in the form of a god who is a special spirit untouched by the impurity of the world, by action and its fruits, and who promotes the freedom of unemancipated spirits. The objections to the later view are obvious; how can there exist a god, who is not removed from all connexion with the world as is the released spirit, and yet is untouched by the misery of the world? In the Upanisad, however, god has a much more real existence; he is hailed as Rudra 2 and begged to spare the votary; he is invoked with the names of MahcŚvara, Hara, and Śiva, and he is identified at times with the Brahman, which, though also set above Rudra, is immediately after 3 expressly given the name of Lord, IŚa, which is essentially that of Rudra. The end of man is to know, to see mystically this god, who is the magician who creates the universe in which the soul by illusion (māyā) is bound. He is the maker of all, all-knower, self-sourced, intelligent, the author of time, yet above the three times and impartite, possession of quali- ties, omniscient, the ruler of matter (pradhāna), and of the spirit, lord of qualities, the cause of transmigration and of liberation, of continuance and of bondage. When men shall roll up space as if it were a piece of leather, then only will there be an end of evil apart from the knowledge of god."

god,1 a doctrine which suggests not the later Yoga, but the spirit of the Bhagavadgita and the general adoration of the teacher, as an essential part of the way of salvation, in the sectarian religions.

The early Upanisads contain no clear trace of the doctrine which is later found in the Buddhism of the Sarvāstivādins, and which discriminates between the power of knowledge to remove causes of existence and that of ecstasy, assigning to the latter alone the power of suppressing all material elements and all sensuous consciousness, knowledge dealing with mental clements and mental consciousness. Such a distinction has every appearance of being an excrescence on the original Buddhist doctrine, evoked by the desire to find a logical place for ecstasy as opposed to mere knowledge, but it may have been early in appearing.

Slight as is normally the recognition in the Buddhist texts of the Brahman doctrine of their rivals, Geiger 3 has shown that the term Dhamma not rarely is used as a substitute, in expressing the Buddhist ideal, for the Brahman of the Upanisads, while the term Brahman itself is occasionally preserved." The famous phrase Wheel of the Law (dhamma-cakka)' is also paralleled by Brahma-cakka; 5 the Dhammayana by Brahmayana; the Tathāgata is not merely an incorporation of Dhamma but also of the Brahman, he has become not only the Dhamma but also the Brahman; the Dhamma even claims the worship which is the lot of the Brahman in the Upanisads."

Nor in choosing the term Dhamma for the system was Buddhism without Upani- ṣad precedent; the Bṛhadaranyaka tells that Brahman created the Dharma, than which nothing is higher, and the Mahānārāyana 10 asserts that the whole universe is encircled by the Dharma, than which there is nothing harder to describe. 

While it is, as has been seen, impossible to accept the derivation of the Samkhya from a materialism, it is probable that its realistic elements were partly due to a contemporary tendency in this direction of which, not un- naturally, we have no direct carly evidence. The CvetaŚvatara Upaniṣad, however, records 11 possible or actual theories of the absolute or final principle (brahman),12 which include necessity (niyati), chance (yadṛccha), time, inherent nature (svabhāva), matter (bhūtāni), and spirit. In the records of Buddhism 18 we have given to us as existing contemporaneously with the Buddha the doctrine of Ajita Kesakambalin, who was in effect a materialist, and who, according to the Jain tradition,14 believed, as did the Cārvākas of the later tradition, in pleasure as the one end to be followed.

doctrine 1 certainly suggest that it was based on some degree at least on the principle enunciated by Yajñavalkya,2 that on dissolution of the body there exists in certain cases no consciousness, which, if the belief in the existence of the Brahman be removed, would result in a pure materialism, regarding the body as the reality of which life is a mere accompaniment, a view attributed also in Buddhist tradition to the king Payasi, who experimentally established that soul did not survive bodily death. The records are important, since they show that the renunciation of belief in the Brahman could produce materialism as well as the Samkhya dualism and the negation of soul in Buddhism. 

The other principles enumerated by the CvetaŚvatara as possible theories are less important. Necessity figures also in the system of Makkhali Gosāla, while inherent nature appears also as an aspect of that system; 4 time has Vedic authority and persisted much later; chance is rather an element in a system than an actual system, while the brevity of the allusion renders it obscure what particular doctrine is referred to.
