The texts which have come down to us are certainly not the beginning of the intellectual activity of the time: they bear every trace in their manner and matter of representing the result of many discussions, and deviations of opinion among the priestly schools. The doctrines have been handled and

rehandled, and the names to which they are ascribed cannot be taken au pied de la lettre as in the case of Yajnavalkya, we cannot assume that they really prove or indicate activity in philosophical research on the part of the men who are mentioned. It is also important to note that the texts, such as they are, are, in the case of the more important at any rate, not the productions of a single hand they are redactions, perhaps made at more than one time,1 of varying philosophic arguments, and they therefore contain very various doctrines, which are not often consistent.

It is perfectly possible to arrive at a rough estimate of the relative periods of the Upanisads. The first place must probably be accorded to the Aitareya Aranyaka in its philosophic portion, that is the first three sections of the second book, and probably the Aitareya Upanisad, which fills the remaining three sections of the second book, is not to be dated later than any of the other Upanisads: the only evidence of later date alleged by Deussen in the case of the Upanisad cannot be taken as sufficient to prove his view. After these works must certainly come the Bṛhadaranyaka Upaniṣad in its main portion, books i-iv, and the Chandogya Upanisad. The Chandogya is in almost every case, as far as one can judge, secondary in its versions of matter which it shares with the Bṛhadaranyaka Upanisad. But at any rate it is certain that the Taittiriya Upanisad, which forms books vii-ix of the Taitti- rīya Aranyaka, is later than the two last-mentioned: it exhibits the doctrine of five as opposed to three elements,5 and that in a way which renders the simple view that the distinction is unimportant most improbable. This is a matter of real consequence in the progress of thought, and the argument is of quite different weight than that derived by Deussen from the fact that the Aitareya Upanisad' knows of four classes of living beings to three of the Chandogya : the classification is merely mentioned en passant, and is of no moment in other Upaniṣads. The Kauṣitaki is much later than the others, except the Taittiriya, but is probably earlier than it. Its version of transmi- gration is a new edition of that in the two great Upanisads, the Bṛhadaranyaka 10 and the Chandogya,11 and its account 12 of Gargya is a more developed one than 1 BAU. consists of three parts (i-ii, iii-iv, v-vi); ii. 4 is repeated in a secondary form in iv. 5. The 8 books of the Chandogya seem each distinct. AA. consists of three parts, ii. 1-3; ii. 4-6; iii. 1-2. See especially Deussen's analyses in Sechzig Upanishad's des Teda. Full bibliographies, translations, and a valuable intr. are found in R. E. Hume's Thirteen Principal Upanishads (1921).

that in the Bṛhadaraṇyaka,1 while in another section 2 it is clearly later than the Aitareya. Finally the Kena, which is in part metrical and is in itself a part of much longer Upanisad, the Jaiminiya Upanisad Brāhmaṇa, is no doubt to be ranked as the last of the older Upanisads. The Jaiminiya Upanisad Brāhmaṇa itself is of the nature of an Aranyaka rather than a mere Upanisad that it does not bear the title Aranyaka is perhaps an idiosyncrasy of the Saman schools, none of which actually call any text of theirs an Aranyaka. As an Aranyaka it has no claim to any very early date: it seems in fact to be certainly later than the Aitareya. The Taittiriya Aranyaka, on the other hand, apart from the Upanisad section (vii-ix and x), is of most miscellaneous content and various date. The Bṛhadaranyaka Upanisad forms part of the last book of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa," and the title shows the close relation of Aranyaka and Upanisad. In the case of the Chandogya, the first two sections of the work are of the Aranyaka type, but as with texts attached to the Samaveda generally do not bear that name. The Kauşitaki, like the Aitareya, is part of a longer Aranyaka.“ 

7 

The next group of Upanisads is marked by the fact that it is composed of texts in metre, with very slight exceptions. It contains the Katha, the IŚa, the CvetaŚvatara, Mundaka and Mahānārāyaṇa, that is the last book (x) of the Taittiriya Aranyaka. The texts are distinguished from the previous group, not merely by their form, but by their contents. The old discussions with their tentative and confused efforts to reach definite results are replaced by a definite phraseology, in which the results of speculation have been summed up in brief dogmas, expressed often with an obvious desire for the paradoxical and the bizarre. The allegories, not rarely found in the Upanisads of the older class, which share them with the Aranyakas, disappear altogether. More marked still is the relation of the texts to the other collections: the Katha bears the name of a famous school of the Black Yajurveda whose Samhita is still preserved for us, but its nature is that it is really a rewriting, from a philosophical as opposed to a ritual point of view, of the story, found in the Taittiriya Brahmaṇa, of Naciketas and the winning of boons from Death by him. The Mahānārāyaṇa is reckoned in some authorities as the tenth book of the Aranyaka of the Taittiriya school, but the Aranyaka is a body of very various and confused contents, and between it and the Upanisad there is no inherent connexion at all, such as always exists in the previous group. Similarly the IŚa Upanisad has succeeded in obtaining entry as a book (x1) of the Vajasaneyi Samhita, with which it has nothing really to do, and which

[Part V 

has been much added to in the course of time, parts of its contents in books xxxi, xxxii, and xxxiv1 belonging in conception to the period of the Brah- manas. The CvetaŚvatara and the Mundaka have not even a nominal effective connexion with any extant text, beyond the fact that the Mundaka uses the Atharvaveda (x. 7), and we need not suppose that they ever had any such connexion. 

2 

In this group it is quite clear that the Katha takes the first rank its style is suggested already by the metrical part of the Kena and by verses found in the Bṛhadaranyaka in a later addition. The IŚa is clearly dependent on the Katha, and the CvetaŚvatara is certainly well aware of the Katha, and is probably a good deal later even than the IŚa, which is free from the sectarian spirit of the CvetaŚvatara in which the philosophy leads up to the glorifica- tion of Rudra as the god par excellence. The Mundaka uses apparently the ŚvetaŚvatara, and it again is probably presumed by the Mahānārāyaṇa." 

5 

The last group of important Upanisads consists of the PraŚna, the Maitra- yaniya, and the Mandukya. They are in prose, but they differ essentially in every respect from the older prose Upanisads: the diction is in style much more elaborate than the early prose, and in the case of the Maitrāyaṇiya, which Max Müller wrongly believed early in date, the language is obviously closely allied to classical Sanskrit, which it follows in the introduction of greater development and complexity of style. The order of the Upanisads in this group is certain as regards the PraŚna and Maitrayaniya," and pro- bable as regards the Maṇḍūkya.8 In philosophy they show their wide know- ledge of the earlier texts, which they freely use. The PraŚna is proved to be later than the Mundaka by the fact that it presupposes it and quotes it." 

With these the list of important Upanisads closes: but the manufacture of these works went on indefinitely down even to modern times. The later Upanisads claimed connexion with the Atharvaveda, and it is probable that the Mundaka and the PraŚna were really so connected: the others had no real bond of union, but were pleased to assume one for their own purposes. These Upanisads fall into four classes, according as they (1) merely develop doctrines already found in the older Upanisads; or (2) devote themselves to

the glorification of the Yoga practices, by which religious ecstasy was pro- duced; or (8) deal with the condition of the Sannyasin; or (4) finally give themselves up to the glorification of Rudra-Śiva. 

The history of the text of the Upanisads is of interest, but not of impor- tance for philosophy: the Atharvan Upaniṣads seem the first to have been collected into one set: we know of collections 1 of 34 or 52,2 in which case others from the older type were added. A later collection, which arose in South India, has 108 Upanisads, including all the great Upaniṣads of the older type. A collection of 50 Upanisads was made at some unknown date and was translated into Persian in 1656 for Dara Shukoh: a literal Latin translation from the Persian made by Anquetil du Perron in 1801-2 was the means of bringing the Upanisads to the notice of Schopenhauer, and winning for them that place in the history of philosophy which they have never lost. The collec- tion includes in 12 Upaniṣads the older texts, 26 Atharvan Upaniṣads and 8 others, and makes up the total by adding four chapters of the Vājasaneyi Samhita. Of the dates of the making of these collections we have no proof: it is, however, possible that by the time of Śankara (9th cent. A.D.) the PraŚna and Mundaka were already studied together. It is certain that he made use of all the Upaniṣads included in the three great groups, save the Maitrāyaṇiya and the Maṇḍūkya, which he perhaps did not regard as an Upanisad at all. To him also are ascribed, though with doubtful justice in all cases, commentaries on these Upanisads, except the Kausitaki and the Maitrāyaṇīya, and also a commentary on the Māṇḍūkya, which however is probably the work of a different Śankara.5 The Upanisads used by Rāmānuja include all those of the great groups, save the Māṇḍūkya (though the Kārikā of Gauḍapada is cited), the Subāla and Culikā, and once even the Garbha, Jābāla, and Maha. The Jābāla and Paiñgi as well as the Kārikā are mentioned by Śankara. 

The question of absolute dates for the Upanisads is one far more difficult than that of the relative order of the texts, and admits of no decisive solution. The one argument of weight is the fact, really undeniable, that the doctrines of the Upanisads are presupposed by the doctrine of the Buddha, and that, accordingly, if we accept the view that the opinions of the Buddha can be gathered with approximate accuracy from the older texts of the Pāli Canon, it is probable that the older Upanisads are, substantially at least, older than say 500 B.C. The argument is not by any means perfect: it may be criticized

on the ground that even now the date of the Buddha is only established by very conjectural means, and still more so by the fact that the date of the Buddhist Canon rests on mere tradition, which is demonstrably in many respects defective, so that the frequently repeated assertion that the Nikayas represent approximately a period shortly after the death of the Buddha is wholly unproved and almost certainly quite untrue. A more serious argument is afforded by the really antique character of the metre of the metrical Upanisads, such as the Katha, Kena, and IŚã, but here again no absolute date is arrived at, since the only standard of comparison is either the epic, which is of very uncertain date and being not in pari materia not an absolutely safe criterion, or Pāli texts, which, apart from their own uncertainty of date, are written in a different speech, and, therefore, certainly not cogently to be adduced as evidence.2 Perhaps more secure is comparison with the metre of the Bṛhaddevata, which is with much plausibility assigned to the fourth century B.C., and this certainly suggests that the metre of these texts is older.

6 

More positive evidence cannot be found: the view that the Katha Upanisad is older than Buddhism, because the legend resembles in some degree the legend of the Buddhist Māra, ignores the fact that the story is already found in the Taittiriya Brāhmaṇa. The suggestion of Walleser 5 that in the Tevijja Sutta we are to find a reference to the Aitareya, Chandogya, and Taittiriya Upaniṣads is quite impossible, and the definite use of any particular Upanisad by any Buddhist Sutta has still to be proved. The similarity of the language of the early Upaniṣads to that of Panini is decidedly against a very early dating. Certainly it is wholly impossible to make out any case for dating the oldest even of the extant Upanisads beyond the sixth century B.C., and the acceptance of an earlier date must rest merely on individual fancy. 

In the case of the later Upanisads any dating must be still more vague. Hopkins indeed suggests the fourth century for such works as the Katha, Maitrāyaṇīya, and the CvetaŚvatara, but this appears to be as regards the Maitrāyaṇīya much too early a date: style and content alike suggest that this is one of the most recent of the important Upanisads. In the case of the CvetaŚvatara, the date selected by Hopkins appears high in view of the fact

that he is convinced that this Upanisad is later than the orthodox atheistic Samkhya, and than the theistic Samkhya-Yoga, and marks the appearance of the illusion doctrine foreign to the early Upanisads. But this view of his can hardly be accepted for reasons which will later be given, and there is, accordingly, no strong objection to the suggested date beyond the fact that there is no cogent evidence for it. A very different view of the date of the ŚvetaŚvatara, the Mundaka, and the Māṇḍūkya Upanisads is suggested by Walleser,1 who holds that the illusion theory is posterior to, and derived from, the nihilistic school of Buddhist thought, and that in particular the Maṇḍūkya is not necessarily anterior to the Kārikā of Gauḍapāda-taken by him as a designation of a Bengal school, not of an individual-which expounds the illusionist form of Vedanta for the first time, and which was in being by A.D. 550, but not necessarily very much earlier. This view, however, is with- out any sound foundation, and of these Upanisads no assured date can even be suggested. 

3 

The investigation of J. Hertel 2 as to the age of the Mundaka Upanisad yields little that is positive. Its comparatively late date is assured, apart from its imitations of the Katha among others, by the fact that it mentions for the first time, except perhaps for the Taittiriya Aranyaka, the seven worlds by name, that it has a list of Vedic sciences which includes the six Vedāngas, though that term is not used, and the Atharvaveda by that title, and uses the term Vedanta of the doctrine of the Upanisads. It knows in all probability the personal Brahman.5 In certain points Hertel indicates similarities with Jain views; thus, as the title indicates, the work seems to belong to an Athar- vavedin sect which practised the habit of shaving the head or pulling out the hair, a Jain practice. The Purusa in the Upanisad is described by comparing his various members to the fire and other cosmic powers; the Jains, unlike Buddhists and Brahmans, are wont to represent the universe in human shape in their cosmographical fancies. The Upanisad approves asceticism, as does Jainism, and treats release as attained by one who has gained the Brah- maloka, and it is from that world that the man who is freed' attains his final abode in the Jain system, and a parallel can be drawn between the terms in

which the Upanisad and the Jain texts describe the ascent. Certain of the terms of the Upanisad have Jain currency (cyu, nirveda, rāga, vītarāga, samyag- jñāna, granthi). It is, however, clear that in all these cases there is no reason to assume Jain priority. Nor do metrical tests do more than show what is other- wise certain, the priority of the Katha.1 Grammatical forms of pronounced inaccuracy suggest careless composition rather than assure any definite date. 

2 

Another possible source of evidence is the date of IŚvarakṛṣṇa, the author of the Saṁkhya Kārikā. It is perfectly clear that the Samkhya system was substantially older than he in its substance and even in detail, so that a considerable age must be assumed for it, if IŚvarakṛṣṇa is to be assigned to the first century A.D. or even the first half of the second century A.D. Unfortu- nately the evidence as to IŚvarakṛṣṇa is by no means satisfactory. It seems, however, clear that he was either an older contemporary, if he is identified with Vindhyavāsa, of Vasubandhu, or still older, but this clearly, accepting the earlier date of Vasubandhu, which terminates his existence about A.D. 350. does not lead us further back than about A.D. 300, or half a century earlier." A further argument, however, has been adduced by S. K. Belvalkar, who holds that the commentary on the Kārikā, which was rendered into Chinese by Paramartha about A.D. 560, was the work of Maṭhara, and is to be dated about A.D. 400. Now as the Maṭhara-Vṛtti frequently calls IŚvarakṛṣṇa Bhagavant, a term which would not readily be applied to a recent author, we may assume the date of the first century A.D. or shortly after for IŚvarakṛṣṇa. 

Unfortunately the evidence for these conclusions is peculiarly unsatis- factory. The work for which the title of Mathara-Vṛtti is claimed bears this title on the strength of a single colophon only in a MS. apparently of A. D. 1400, which is a very slender piece of evidence. The careful analysis of Belvalkar himself shows that it contains up to 3 per cent. of what he regards as con- taminations with Gauḍapada, and 20 per cent. of students' additions, includ- ing a reference to the Hastamalaka attributed to Śankara, while it gives apparently an extra Kārikā, which certainly has no real claim to be original. In these circumstances, instead of claiming that we have the Maṭhara- Vṛtti established as the source of Paramartha and Gauḍapada, the natural conclusion seems to be that this is a compilation derived from the original commentary, now lost, to which the style of Maṭhara-Vṛtti has been given without authority in the lighthearted manner of scribes and owners of MSS. Practically fatal to the theory of Maṭhara as the author of the original com-

ment is the fact that the translator nowhere gives or hints at this name, which is also ignored by Gauḍapada. What we really do know of an early Mathara is that Jain texts 1 which refer to the Satthitanta add to it the Madhara, which means probably that Maṭhara wrote on the Sastitantra, with which agrees precisely the assertion of Gunaratna Sūri in his commentary on the SaddarŚanasamuccaya that Maṭhara's Bhāṣya was Şaşṭitantroddhara- rupa. Otherwise, the silence regarding Mäṭhara as a commentator of the Kārikā is complete. We are, therefore, left without any evidence of the real authorship of the original commentary, which, if not by IŚvarakṛṣṇa himself, need not go back earlier than A.D. 500. 

Mention should perhaps be made of the argument deduced by Jacobi 2 from the Kauțiliya ArthaŚãstra from which he infers that the Samkhya and Yoga systems were in existence as well as the Purva Mimänsä and the materialist system of the Lokayata by the fourth century B.C. Unhappily the evidence adduced for this is not satisfactory, as the date of the ArthaŚãstra must probably 3 be placed some centuries after the date of the minister of Candragupta under whose name it passes. 

From a literary point of view the Upanisads command interest by their introduction of new forms. The dialogue appears beside the simpler dogmatic exposition of the Brahmanas, expanded and developed from the brief dis- cussions in this form of ritual problems which the Brahmaņas occasionally present. The individual character of the new teaching, which was a mystery, naturally furthered this mode of treatment, and dialogues are recorded between very strange interlocutors as well as between teacher and pupil. Interesting is the fact of competitions in which the speakers contend against one another, in order to win favour and the prize offered by a rich prince. Or two Brahmans are enjoying the meal offered by admirers; one comes to them and wins food by setting a clever riddle. A son returns to his father to report that he has been questioned, and has found himself unable to return a reply; his father assures him that he has told him all he knows, and goes with him to seek instruction. The wise can be induced by strange causes to give of their wisdom. The geese sing the praises of Raikva; he is found under a cart, scratching himself; offers of cows he haughtily refuses, but, when JanaŚruti presents his daughter, he taunts him with not realizing that this was the boon with which he should have sought his favour.4 Janaka of Videha is the king who appears as the greatest of patrons, and Yājñavalkya the wisest of Brahmans; in one contest of wits alone he vanquishes nine opponents;

The gods appear; Prajapati instructs the intelli- gent pupil Indra and the stupid demon Virocana." Animals lend their quota of tuition; the pupil, who watches his master's kine increase, receives instruction from the bull of the herd, from the fire, from a gander, and from a Madgu bird.3 It would, of course, be rash to trust to the historicity of the dialogues; they are attached readily to famous names, as in the Katha Naciketas and Yama carry on a dialogue in the later form of verse. 

There is, of course, much that contrasts strangely with the Platonic dialogue. An element of grave risk enters into such discussions, as we have seen in the case of the rivals of Yajñavalkya; to hold a wrong view often involves risk of death in an age when the curse is believed to have power to work its own end. Again of real dialectic there is hardly any; the inquirer is ignorant and makes wrong guesses, the teacher dogmatically expounds the truth, with little or no leading up to it, and with still less reasoning for its support; curiously enough, it is in the discussions between Indra and Praja- pati that we find more of the expression of uncertainty leading to a final illumination than usual. There are, however, especially in the dialogues of Yajnavalkya, signs of planning; the outcome is attained by a process of rejection of inferior views, arranged in something like a series of lower to higher.6

No serious advance in logic is made over the Brahmanas, though faint traces of induction by simple enumeration may be traced." On the other hand, there is a certain gain in literary form; the description of the unity of the universe produces passages of much higher feeling than was possible when dealing with the sacrifice, and distinct power is shown in the invention of such designations of the Atman as 'Not so, not so,' which excludes all particularization, while the phrase That thou art' not unworthily sums up the mystery of the identity of the self and the universe. In other cases we have empty mysticism as in the unintelligible jalan or tadvanam 10 as expressions of the absolute. One distinctive feature of value is the use of similes, often of complexity and interest; they are treated as conclusive arguments, though often only fanciful analogies, and though as always, if these are pressed, they tend to confuse the precise meaning of the text, and have afforded cause for doubt both to ancient and to modern interpreters."

inherited from the sacrificial tradition, are curiously rare, though not unknown, and in the carlier Upanisads the employment of verse is restricted, though it occurs here and there in the Bṛhadaranyaka and the Chandogya. Inter- esting as presaging the manner of the Pāli texts is the constant repetition of the same idea in slightly different forms; thus whatever is said of one sense is normally repeated verbatim, with only the essential changes, for another; the generic terms which would have spared the tedium have not yet been invented or even felt to be necessary and appropriate.1
