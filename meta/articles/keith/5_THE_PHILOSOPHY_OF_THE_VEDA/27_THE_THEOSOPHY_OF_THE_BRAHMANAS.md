## 1. The General Character of the Brahmana Philosophy THE value of the Brāhmaṇas as sources of philosophy is difficult to deter- mine with any accuracy. They are works in which the imagination of succes- sive generations of priests has been allowed to run riot: there is no modera- tion in their conception, and no great Brahmana is, as far as can be judged, the production of a single mind.1 The one great merit of Greek philosophy, the appearance of clear-cut ideas expressed in works of individual authorship, is wholly wanting for us in the Brahmaņas, and the question constantly obtrudes itself to what extent we can believe that the priests by whom these texts were composed and handed down held the views which they wrote down. In many cases it may be taken that they did not; the works abound in their explana- tions of rites with all sorts of absurdities, which we need not accuse the priests of being so foolish as not to recognize as absurdities; but the question of the dividing line between profoundity and absurdity presents itself with the greatest frequency. 

It is, however, another question whether we can acquiesce in the theory of Deussen 2 that the Brahmaṇas in various places are conscious of higher philosophical views, which they ignore and turn to ritual purposes. The proofs which he adduces of his theory are far from carrying conviction. In his view the account of the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa 3 of the origin of the Naci- ketas fire is really posterior in order of conception to the account in the Katha Upanisad. It is there told that VajaŚravasa made an offering, at which he gave to the priests all his goods, retaining, however, his son, Naci- ketas, as the ritual prescribes ; the boy, however, insisted that he should also be given, and his father in just irritation at his persistence gave him to death. The young man goes, in the true spirit of fairy tale, to the house of Yama, who

arises; it is all a piece of imagination, parallel to the visit of Bhṛgu to the other world, recounted in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (xi. 6. 1) and the Jaiminiya Brāhmaṇa, i. 42-4 (JAOS. xv. 234 ff.). Barua's view (Prebuddh. Ind. Phil., p. 265), that the Naciketas legend represents the philosophy of the Gotaniakas mentioned in the Añgut- tara, is clearly quite without plausi- bility.Chap. 27]

is away, and who, therefore, for three nights fails in the important duty of the due reception of guests. He must, therefore, on his return make atonement, and he gives the lad three boons. Naciketas chooses the kind reception of him by his father on his return, the imperishableness of his due reward for his sacrifices and gifts to the priests,' and the freedom from repeated death- not in this world, in all probability. In the two latter cases the god teaches the boy the way of piling the Naciketas fire. To this Deussen takes exception, and thinks that originally the means to the third wish must have been the knowledge of the eternal redemption from the bonds of death, and he holds, therefore, that in the Brahmaṇa we have the expression of a polemical attitude to the more philosophical doctrine. The idea appears, however, to be one wholly unjustifiable. The aim of the ritual is simply to assert the value of this fire, and the repetition of the fire as the means of knowledge of the end desired is perfectly natural and simple. That the boy asked for the grant of final release is nowhere hinted at: what he fears, according to the language used, is simply that, as is often threatened in the later Brāhmaṇņas, he may fall in due course, even in the next world, under the control of death. 

Nor is there any happier result to be seen in the second case adduced by Deussen. It is of course later in the Upanisads the doctrine that the whole essence of man is contained in the Atman, 'self', that the essence of the world is also an Atman, and that the two are identical. This idea he finds expressed in a sentence of the Taittiriya Brāhmaṇa,2 where it is said that the various gods, the plants, and trees are in various parts of man, Indra in his strength, Parjanya in his head, the lord, that is Rudra-Śiva, in his anger, the Atman in his Atman, the Atman in his heart, the heart in him, he in the im- mortal, the immortal in the Brahman. In this passage he thinks that the assertion of the identity of the Atman is really a reference to the identity of the self of man and of the universe, an assertion of the fundamental view of the Upanisads wrapped up with a different view. The answer to this is clearly that the passage cannot be pressed to yield so much it is possible that it simply has the sense that the body of the world is in the body of man, but it is pro- bably merely a vague identification of self with self, without any profound meaning being either felt, or, though felt, hidden. The conscious identifica- tion of the universal spirit and the individual is a very different thing from such a phrase as that in question, and the theory that the phrase indicates a knowledge, but a degradation, of the higher truth, is too far-fetched. 

: 

The point is of importance, since the Vedic tradition makes a clear dis- tinction between Brāhmaṇas and Upanisads, though it attaches as we have seen the Upaniṣads to Brahmaņas. The distinction corresponds, we may fairly say, in the main to a change of time and still more to a change of view. The Upanisads hold in some degree at least the doctrine of transmigration, and, though not in a developed condition, the pessimism which follows on it: these views are not those of the Brahmanas, which, taken all in all, know not

transmigration, have no conception of pessimism, and therefore seek no release from the toils of life, for which in reality there is no ending. These are funda- mental distinctions, and they give an essentially different aspect to the speculations of the Brāhmaṇas as compared with those of the Upanisads. (A further distinction lies in the fact that the Brahmaņas are essentially connected with the doctrine of the sacrifice. The sacrifice clearly occupied the minds of the priests to the practical exclusion of all else, and their theories were in large measure devoted to the consideration of its relation to the universe, to the gods, and to men.1 In the Upanisads this is not the case; the sacrifice is still here and there the subject of speculation, but the speculation is no longer based on the view that the sacrifice is all in all. Hence it is that so little progress can be seen in the Brāhmaṇas towards the development of a real philosophy. The Rigveda carries us nearly as far as anything excogitated in this period.. 

The conception of order is one which is wholly strange to the Brahmaņas, and any treatment of the philosophy implied and contained in them must neglect the divisions of these texts, which in the main follow merely the order of the rites performed in the sacrificial ritual. The most important of these conceptions from the point of view of philosophy are (1) the endeavour to state the nature of the highest principle of the universe, (2) the theory of the sacrifice, and (3) the nature of truth and right. On all of these topics there is available much material, but the sameness of the ideas is obvious through a multitude of detailed differences. 

## 2. The Highest Principle of the Universe 

2 

In the period of the Brāhmaṇas the god Prajapati occupies without doubt or question the position of the creator god, the supreme god of the world. The commencement of legend after legend proclaims his creative activity, often figured under the form of the practising of fervour, a reminder of the cosmic heat, whence came forth the power enclosed in the shell according to the view of the hymn of creation. The world egg appears as producing the heaven and the earth from its two parts, and, as Hiranyagarbha, it is the form of Prajapati, in which he proceeds to immediate creation of living beings of all kinds, and the ordering of the universe. These tales, of which there is no end, often tell us that Prajapati felt at the end of his efforts that he was empty, and had to be filled up again, always by some ritual process. The details of these stupid myths are wholly unimportant: it is enough to note that he is constantly the creator, the ruler, and the preserver of the world and is accepted by every Brahmana of the period as being the lord of the world: he is, it may be added, without any ethical importance: the conception of him is purely intellectual, that of the unity of the universe, and the choosing

Chap. 27] 

The Highest Principle of the Universe 

443 

of Prajapati as the symbol of this unity is one of the most striking proofs of the great influence of the Rigveda upon the period of the Brahmaņas. 

Of Prajapati's activities the most interesting are his relation as creator to the gods, to the Asuras, whose connexion is with the darkness and cunning, and to men. He is, however, much more than the mere universe he is the unmeasured, the unexpressed, as opposed to the measured and the expressed in nature he is the seventeenth beside the sixteen elements of the psychic organs the thirty-fourth above the thirty-three gods. He is universal peace, the decider of disputes among the gods; he gives Indra his victorious prowess and his crown of victory. He is devoid of sorrow, for there is no sorrow in heaven. He is the lord of the three worlds, he sits above them and sees in himself the seed of creation, and the gods proceed from his mouth, the Asuras from his descending breath, that of nutrition. 

It is, however, clear that in Prajapati the Brahmaņas do not find complete satisfaction for their view of the construction of the universe. The Atharva- veda, which in these matters must be ranked with the Brāhmaṇas, in its version of the great hymn of the Rigveda, which, as later expanded,1 mentions him as all-creator, leaves out the last line giving his name and the Brahmaṇa of that Veda, which is certainly late, replaces him by the Brahman and Atharvan. In the Brahmanas, therefore, we find efforts made to arise to a principle above and beyond him in the Rigveda he produced from himself- the idea of world creation is always in the Vedic literature regarded in the light of the sending out of something already there rather than of mere bringing into being the waters, and then entered them in the form of Hiranyagarbha, the golden germ. In the Taittiriya Samhita,3 we find in the spirit of the hymn of creation the waters treated in two places as the prius, and Prajapati as arising as wind on them, and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa goes one step farther in attributing to the waters as Prajapati's predecessors as first in order the act of fervour, which is primarily his activity in creation. A farther step is taken in the Taittiriya Aranyaka,5 in which the waters come first, then Prajapati, in whose mind desire arises and who practises fervour; then his body he throws off from the sap is born the tortoise, who is Purușa, who, however, asserts his priority to Prajapati himself, and from the flesh the seer Aruņaketu, to whom further creative activity is assigned. Yet another step is reached in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, where the first thing is stated to be not-being, then arises Prajapati, who is the same as Purușa, and then the Brahman, the holy science, the threefold Veda, with which he enters the waters as a creative principle. Thus sprang up the world egg, whence came forth first the

Brahman itself, and then Prajapati in the form of Agni. But in another account 1 the priority of the Brahman over Prajapati is made absolute, not merely empirical: the first entity is not-being, then springs into life mind, i.e. the Brahman, and then Prajapati. Later still the Brahman produces Prajapati, but without face or sight; then it enters him, as breath, and makes him mortal, to arise as a generator of beings. 

3 

There is nothing particularly valuable or serious in these attempts, though they merit mention. More interesting are efforts to explain the nature of Prajapati, and to dispose thus of him. The position of Prajapati as decider of disputes leads to the view that he intervenes in the great dispute of the mind and speech as to which should be given the higher rank, a dispute settled by Prajapati in favour of mind. The connexion of speech and mind as clements in Prajapati himself is expressed by the figure of union between the two within him, and either is occasionally made into the final entity of the world thus mind is identified with Brahman, with Prajapati, and even with the first principle, which is neither being nor not-being, of the hymn of creation. Similarly Vac, 'speech', is identified with Prajapati, or even placed above Prajapati, identified with ViŚvakarman, with the whole world, and with Indra. These identifications are, however, despite their interest, of no importance for Indian philosophy: the will or the intellect as such does not in fact become the essential reality of any Indian orthodox philosophy. Prajapati is also the sacrifice, and sacrifices himself to the gods, for, as we have seen, the order of the world is constantly compared with the sacrifice, and Puruşa by being sacrificed creates the universe: he is also the year," or both, and these identifications are of great importance in connexion with the theory of sacrifice to which we shall return. 

4 

In the Atharvaveda 9 we find several further efforts to substitute for Prajapati new names and ideas. In this effort it is certainly difficult to resist the view that the Atharvaveda is out of the main stream of Vedic develop- ment the hymns seem like deliberate efforts to convert into a kind of poetry the philosophical ideas of the Brahmaṇa period without any real inspiration of any sort. The abstractions Kāla, 'time',10 and Rohita,11 'the ruddy one', probably the sun as the more concrete expression of time, are identified with Prajapati and praised as all-creating the ox 12 and the cow, VaŚã,13 are also identified with the god, and may to some extent be compared with the view of the Brahmanas, that the sacrifice is Prajapati. But the

Atharvaveda goes farther and in its pseudo-theosophy exalts many other things to the rank of supreme powers, the ladles, the Darbha grass amulet, the porridge cooked for the priest, the bull offered in the sacrifice, the deity Anumati, and possibly others. In two cases a deeper meaning has been seen by Deussen,2 who finds in the Skambha hymns 3 an effort to find a principle above Prajapati which supports the whole universe, and in the Ucchiṣṭa hymn, a glorification of what is left over', not, as is normally believed, from the offering, but after all that is empirical has been abstracted from the universe, an idea which he thinks can possibly be reconciled with the normal view by remembrance of the fact that Purusa in the sacrifice hymn is said to be only a quarter in the universe, the other three-quarters being beyond it. But it is impossible to take this speculation seriously, and the Skambha hymn has no great claim to be more than a poor piece of theo- sophical juggling with words, save in so far as it seems to identify Skambha with the Brahman, and as it served as a suggestion for the Mundaka Upanisad.5 

6 

But beside these ideas there is to be found a much more fruitful source of philosophy, the creation of the conception of the Brahman as a cosmic principle. The origin of the meaning of Brahman is uncertain: it is inter- preted by the Vedanta school, absurdly, as the absolute from vrh, twist', tear away; the view of Max Müller is that it denotes what grows, from vrh in the sense of grow', that which expresses itself in speech or in nature as force. The view of Deussen 7 is that it is the human will in its striving to the divine, when the individual in prayer returns to the timeless, spaceless, individualless self of his, which is God. These senses are somewhat elaborate, and render it difficult to think that the word really had any such meaning: neither for the views of Max Müller nor for that of Deussen is there any support in the actual use of the word in the Rigveda. There at any rate the word naturally and normally means prayer, but there are further develop- ments it can mean spell, for the prayer may be a spell, and not real prayer,

[Part V 

and it often means holy speech and the holy writ, the three-fold Veda. It is not necessary to trace to the original sense of Brahman the fact that the Vedic poet regards himself often as inspired: we cannot really think it probable, and certainly no argument had yet been adduced to show, that the prayer was felt to be the voice of God speaking in the prayer. But in many passages it seems as if Brahman must be taken rather as holy power than as prayer or holy rite the gods are said to discuss the Brahman, and, when the great- ness of the Brahman is celebrated, it is clear that more than the mere word may be intended. But the growth of the idea of Brahman as a suitable expression for the absolute must have been greatly furthered by the extraordinary value attached to the prayer and to the spell. The prayer rapidly passes over to the lower rank in one late hymn of the Rigveda 1 a prayer is offered that Agni should in union with the Brahman drive away disease. The spell appears repeatedly by itself in the Atharvaveda as a power to destroy evil of all kinds, and the Brahman is actually set over against the three Vedas as a power of equal force. It is a very easy step from the conception of the Brahman as the prayer, which brings into operation the activity of the gods, or as the spell which is the cause of results aimed at by men, and from the conception of the whole body of such spells and prayers, to develop the use of the term to cover the idea of holy power generally, and this rendering is applicable in many passages of the Brāhmaṇas, where the idea of holy writ is too vague and the idea of the absolute is too elaborate.

A further element should doubtless be allowed for in the process of the evolution of the use of the term Brahman. Oldenberg, indeed, has denied that in the Veda there exists either the idea or the word for a supernatural power pervading the universe, akin to that power which in Melanesia is denoted by mana, among the Hurons by orenda, and variously in other parts of the world. It seems, however, unlikely that no such general idea should have appealed to the intellect of the Indians. If we accept, as we should, the view that individual powers are older in conception than manifestations of a universal power, still it seems natural to suppose that India developed the conception of a power common to the various gods, just as there was admitted the unity of the gods even by the time of certain Rigvedic hymns. This power, we may assume, was naturally denoted by the term Brahman, as a result of the extraordinary importance attached by priests to the prayers and spells which secured them their means of livelihood, and which served to propitiate the gods or to secure ends desired by their patrons or themselves. Other terms such as Māyā, which served in part to denote a power similar to mana, failed 

gods, or vice versa, in religious life; cf. Güntert, Der arische Weltkönig, pp. 222 ff.

to be widely generalized. Asu possibly served the same purpose, if we believe the view of Güntert that Asura denotes primarily and properly the possessor of mana.1 

A very different view of the nature of the Brahman is presented by Hertel,2 who asserts that the misinterpretation of the term is one of the many fatal errors of Vedic scholarship, shared alike by the Indian and the western inter- preters. The essential work of Indian philosophers of the Upanisad period was to depersonalize the old gods, and to show that in the macrocosm and the microcosm alike there existed nothing save nature powers and processes, which required no explanation by the assumption of divinities. The Kṣatriyas who were the sources of the doctrine of the Upanisads rejected the doctrine of personal deities, and also the theory that man's lot depended on his deeds, and constructed in lieu a materialistic, monistic, science of nature, which was at once morally indifferent and in essence atheistic. The priests decided to render innocuous this doctrine by amalgamating it with their own as an esoteric system. On this view the Brahman is that which fills all beings, stimulates the sense organs, penetrates the whole world, and encircles the universe. Its true nature is revealed in those passages of the Upanisads which describe the Brahman as qualified, the unqualified Brahman being manifestly the product of further refinement of speculative thought. Now in certain passages we find that the Brahman is the bodily warmth in man, which is identified with his self, Atman, and also with the cosmic light or fire (tejas or jyotis). These passages are to be taken perfectly literally, and this version throws an important light on the Indian ascetic, Tapasa, who is a very different person from the Christian ascetic. The latter practises chastity and flees from desires, because these are the work of the devil, and he seeks to kill carnal longings. The Tapasa inflicts even more serious penances on himself and remains celibate, merely to increase the vital fire within him, and fit him- self for the abundance of sexual delight which Indian opinion as early as the Atharvaveda * and even in the Upanisads 5 assures him. The fire, however, which composes the self of the individual, is essentially bound up with the power of thought. The cosmic Brahman, on the other hand, is fire (jyotis) in no metaphorical sense; the brahmaṇaḥ parimaraḥ of the Aitareya Brāh- maņa really means that all comes from fire and is resolved into it again. Now the connexion of the individual and the cosmic fire is simple; the rays of the sun bring fire into the heart of the individual, and at death the fire departs from

him back to the sun whence it came, or rather to the heaven of fire, which lies above the earth and of which the sun and the moon are doors pierced in it. The idea of this path of light is older than the Upanisads, for it occurs in verses cited in the Bṛhadaranyaka Upanisad,1 and the Atharvaveda 2 knows the threads of which life is woven and calls this knowledge the great Brāhmaṇa, that is the great secret of the Brahman. Prior to the Upanisads we find the conception in a personal shape, Bṛhaspati, the lord of the heaven of light, the peer of Zeus Pater, of Jupiter, of the German war god, a form of Dyaus himself. It is for this that he appears in the Rigveda as the highest of gods, their father and ruler, guardian of the Rta, leader of men, enemy of all that is false, an Indian parallel to Ahura Mazdāh. Significant is his connexion with NaraŚansa, for in the Avesta Nairyosanha is not merely the envoy of Ahura Mazdah, but also the fire which burns in the kings and secures them in their power. Bṛhaspati as lord of the heaven is responsible for breaking through its stone boundary to set the sun as a source of the streaming forth of its light; moreover he has placed the stars there, and released through the apertures the waters amid the noise of his thunders. Significant is the assertion that he encompasses or is present in all (vibhu), the Rigveda thus saying of the personal deity what the Upanisads assert of the depersonalized Brahman.

The obvious question why the term Brahman is so regularly used of prayer in the Rigveda is answered by the theory that the cause is used for the effect, and similarly the use of rc and dhi, dhiti, and didhiti is explained. Moreover a suitable etymology is found in the comparison with the Greek pλéyw and Latin flagro, and the Brahmacarin of the Atharvaveda 5 is ex- plained as one who concentrates in himself the fire from which all conditions and actions in the world are derived. The fact that Bṛhaspati appears in the Rigveda already as a moon god, which Hertel accepts from Hillebrandt," is explained as due to the gradual fading out of the idea of the sun and moon as merely doors to heaven and the abode of the Soma, the rain, and the Fathers, and the emergence of the conception of the moon as actually the home of these beings. 

Ingenious as is the theory, it is clear that it cannot claim acceptance as probable. The idea that fire pervades and constitutes the essence of the universe is based on the interpretation given to the Brahman; independent evidence is wholly lacking; Hertel cites only an Atharvan passage in which it is stated that fire exists in the earth, the plants, the waters, stones, men, cattle, and horses, and an Avestan reference to six fires which the Pahlavi tradition interprets as the fire in kings, the temple fire, and that of everyday

Neither of these passages even suggests that fire is the essential principle of the universe, and the only other proof, the etymology of Brahman, is extremely far from con- vincing. Not a single passage is adduced in which Brahman normally or naturally denotes fire, and the transfer of meaning alleged is harsh and im- plausible, for the alleged parallel of rc and dhi is quite unproved. The whole theory in fact rests on the overestimation of the terms light (tejas or jyotis) applied to the self, individual or cosmic, and insistence on treating them as essentially material. We have to deal with an early stage of intellectual effort, and with the great difficulty of expressing the nature of the self in anything but material terms, as well as with the fact that the Brahman is not an abstraction. It is something which embraces all, and which is manifested in the warmth of the body and in the heat of the sun. But it is manifested also in the breath of man and in the wind, and it is to exaggerate one element out of all propor- tion to find the fundamental reality in fire, even when that fire is deemed to be endowed with intelligence, and therefore to be much more than merely material. 

In the process of evolution of the conception of Brahman an important part is played by the identification of the Brahman and Bṛhaspati, 'the lord of prayer' he is in the later period of the Brāhmaṇas always regarded as the Purohita of the gods, as their Brahman priest in the technical sense of the term and also as the Brahman itself,1 an idea which is often expressed. Now Bṛhaspati is the depository of great power already in the Rigveda, and this element undoubtedly aided the conception of the Brahman to obtain great prominence. This prominence as usual takes the form of identification with many diverse things, such as speech and truth and holy order, Rta,2 as the wind into which the five deities, sun, moon, fire, lightning and rain all enter and from which they emerge,3 as the breaths, and often as the sun. In the latter aspect the Brahman appears as the firstborn of the day, and perhaps also as the firstborn of the whole crcation, a conception which places it on a lower plane than the final reality. The tendency is, however, more and more to place the Brahman on that plane: as we have seen, Prajapati, who at first is the superior of and the creator of the Brahman, as the holy writ, became identified with the Brahman, as is often expressly stated in the Brāhmaṇas, and is at last placed below the Brahman as a metaphysical principle. With this view we attain to the conception of Brahman Svayambhu, the Brahman which exists of itself and which is regarded as being the cause of the universe, in which it sacrifices itself in the usual parallelism of the world and the

sacrifice, the ground of the continued existence of the universe, and the source into which on death things return. Hence we meet the idea that by correct sacrifice a man may succeed in obtaining community of life and abode with the Brahman, or by right study of the Veda avoid repeated death and attain identity of essence with the Brahman.1 The further step is taken to apply to the Brahman the attribute of taking the place of the highest god, Prajapati or ViŚvakarman of the Rigveda, and this is duly done in the Taittiriya Brāhmaṇa, The Atharvaveda 3 in its own peculiar way recognizes the same idea in its explanation of the Brahman and the Brahmacarin, the Brahman student, as the highest of beings. 

4 

2 

The final step to be taken in the conception of the Brahman was to identify it with the Atman, which, from another point of view in the Brahmanas, attains the position of representative of the unity of the world, and this step is partially taken in the Taittiriya Brāhmaṇa, where the Brahman and the omnipresent Atman are identified, and the self of man, as it seems, is stated to be the mode of finding the Atman, while knowledge of it frees from contamina- tion by works, and the same idea occurs in the Catapatha Brāhmaṇa. Both these passages, however, are clearly transitional to the period of the Upanisads, and mark the end of the reflections of the Brahmaṇas before the new views were definitely accepted. 

Apart from the most improbable etymology, suggested by Hertel, which has been discussed above, there is, as we have seen, no ground to find more in the word than, in the first place, prayer, and the development which it undergoes is in all probability to be attributed to the growth of the importance of the prayer in the mind of the priest, not in the realization of the subjective nature of prayer as the striving towards the divine, which is in reality the human, will. The Brahman is, therefore, rather a conception of the ritual and of religion, not a psychological principle, and it is in my opinion impossible to accept the view of Deussen," that the Atman is evolved from the Brahman by developing the conception of the subjective element, which lay in the latter. The conception of the Brahman and the Atman is late, and has every appearance of being a syncretism & due to the fact that the two expres- sions had by diverse ways come to be regarded as expressions for the same thing, the highest reality and unity of the universe, and the history of the Atman suggests that it had from the first an independent existence. This view is certainly strengthened by the fact that the opinion of Deussen is based to some degree on a new etymology, which he suggests for that word: in place of the root an, 'breathe', at, 'move', or av (= vā), ' blow', and connexion with the Greek árμós, áürμýv, and Germanic atum, aedhm, he suggests that

it is a highly abstract word derived from the roots a seen in aham, 'I', and ta, 'this', so that it denotes this I,' the self, which in due course is felt to be the final expression possible for the ultimate fact of existence, arrived by stripping away the various coverings which envelop the ultimate reality, the covering of the body, the covering of the mind, the covering of the intellect. This view he supports, not merely by the undoubted difficulties in the explanation of the form Atman, and of the corresponding form in the Rigveda, without the ā, but also by the suggestion that the development of meaning assumed from 'wind', in which sense it is found only four times in the Rigveda, to 'self' is more difficult than the development of meaning which his own etymology would give. Thus he thinks from this I could easily spring the view of the body in contrast to the outer world, and thence the trunk in contrast to the limbs, and on the other hand the sense of the soul in opposition to the body, and real being in opposition to unessential things. The possibility of such an etymology must, however, be denied: without pretending that the problems of the relation of Atman and Tman is easy, or that the etymology is certain, the fact remains that the word does mean wind' in the Rigveda,2 that the normal use of it there is breath of life', and that the meaning 'wind' is harder to deduce from breath', than vice versa, and that to deduce either' wind' or breath' from the conception of this I ' is extremely difficult.

The real history of Atman seems then to be that from the meaning' wind' sprang early up that of the breath': thence came the meaning 'self', as when it is said of Surya that he is the self of that which stands and moves.3 Then we have the use of the self as a reflexive pronoun, and the use as meaning the body, an idea which is clearly intended when it is contrasted with Prāṇa, 'the breath': the meaning' trunk, as opposed to limbs, is an easy develop- ment from this sense. But the sense breath' or self' is also capable of being understood in more abstract ways, and we, therefore, find Atman used to denote the essential nature of a thing: this use is already found in the Rigveda where the nature of the breath, the blood, the self of the earth, is put as a question, and similarly we hear of the self of the discase Yakṣma," of all beings, and the adjective atmanvant, possessing existence'. But of much more importance is the development of the use of the word to denote the self of man in direct distinction from the members of his body and his body itself it must be admitted that the use is far from common in the Vedic literature, but twice in the Atharvaveda the contrast of Atman with breath and body seems clearly intended, and the same thing must be admitted for two passages in the Śatapatha,10 in which either one or ten breaths are set over

against the self. Further, it seems that efforts were being made to define the self either as mind or as consciousness, Vijñāna.1 

The development of the meaning of Atman was accompanied by the development of the conception of the relation of the Atman of the universe and the Atman of the individual. The comparison of the macrocosm and the microcosm had been familiar from the time of the Rigveda,2 where the cosmic Puruşa is clearly closely allied to the individual man. In the case of Puruşa, however, under that name we do not find that the conception of his Atman was developed: of the individual man we have the question asked, later at least, what is left after his members are dispersed by death; but, though it might have been expected that this problem would have been posed in the case of Puruşa, there is no evidence that this was ever done. The reference to the cosmic Atman seen by Deussen 3 in a passage of the Taittiriya Brāhmaṇa is as shown above too doubtful to found any argument upon: if the cosmic Atman is really deliberately meant, it is very strange that the series of identi- fications of macrocosm and microcosm should not end there, but should proceed to the abode of the Atman in the heart, the heart in the man, the man in the immortal, and the immortal in the Brahman. More important is the recognition of the Atman as cosmic in the Atharvaveda, as the conclusion of the second Skambha hymn.5 

8

4 

In the case of Prajapati, the development of the conception of the Atman is very clear the creator enters, in the view of the Rigveda and of all subsequent texts, into the creation with his spirit, and the terms now used in the late works, the Taittiriya Aranyaka and the Tadeva section of the Vājasancyi Samhita, are that he enters with the self into the self. It is needless to press the exact force of these words: it is sufficient to note that they obviously lend themselves to the view of the identity of the cosmic self with the self of man. The actual expression of this identity is found only occasionally and in late texts such as the Taittiriya Aranyaka and the Śivasankalpa section of the Vājasaneyi Samhita,10 both works which are of the latest period of the Brahmana epoch and closely analogous to Upanisads, while the identification of the Atman and the Brahman is also, as we have seen, confined to texts of the most developed stratum of Brāhmaṇa philosophy, the Taittiriya Brāhmaṇa 11 and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,12 in either case in late chapters. 

9 

Of other expressions of the inner nature of man, the Puruşa is of no very serious importance for the philosophy of this epoch: he is indeed mentioned in two sections of the Vajasaneyi Samhita, the Uttaranarayana and the

Tadeva, in which he is identified with Prajapati, and with Brahman, ensouls nature, is before but is also produced by the gods, is the source of time and is without limit in space; moreover the cosmic and the individual self appear to be identified, and we find the doctrine1 that, as Anquetil du Perron expresses it, Quisquis Deum intelligit Deus fit; the inspired scer can become identical with the deity, entering with his own self into the self." But, though the term Puruşa is occasionally used as a vague expression for the human personality, it is not destined to become in this period ever a very definite or clear conception. On the other hand the Brahmaņas have an important principle of existence to match with the Atman, and one the prominence of which never disappears entirely in Indian philosophy, though the Samkhya system seeks to diminish its place. This is the conception of the Prana or the Prāņas, breath' or ' vital airs', which achieves an importance denied to the older term Asu. 

C 

' 

The importance of the breath is due obviously to its connexion with the life of man or beast, and we find in the Śatapatha Brahmana 4 the express statement that the victim is the breath, since only while it breathes is it a beast at all, and, when the breath departs, it is a mere inert mass. But the term is naturally enough extended to other forms of the activity of life, the speech, the hearing, the sight, and the mind, and further in the Vedic view between the organ and the activity there was no very clear distinction: 5 the ear is what hears and the hearing, the eye what sees and the sight, and so on. The number of the vital airs is very various: they can be reckoned pretty much at pleasure as two, three, five, seven, nine, twelve, thirteen, and so on. But nine are often mentioned: seven in the head and two below. The seven in the head are the mind, speech, the breath itself, the two eyes and the two ears, and those below the organs of reproduction and evacuation. But the seven can be reduced to five by counting the cars and eyes as one organ each, and from quite different points of view we have six,' two eyes, nostrils and ears, or two, Prāņa and Udana, or three, Prana, Udana, and Apana. These

there it is quite impossible to say if the conception was not materialistic (as in the Milindapañha, p. 60; Walleser, Die philosophische Grundlage des älteren Buddhismus, pp. 113, 114).

vital airs are repeatedly called the gods, Devas: they are produced from the ascending airs of Prajapati with which he created the gods, and the view that these activities are divine is a perfectly natural one from the point of view of Vedic religion, and it is quite unnecessary 1 to attribute the use of the term to the fact that no word for nature powers existed.

2 

The multitude of Praņas, however, rest upon a single Prāņa, which is some- times, it would seem, sought to be identified with mind, but normally is called the Mukhya Praṇa, the chief of the breaths. Its position appears clearly in a legend of creation in the Śatapatha Brahmana. From the not-being arose the seven Prāņas in the shape of the seven seers: they were kindled up by the Prāņa in the middle as Indra, whereupon they produced the seven Purusas, which again united themselves to one Purușa. The same priority of one Prāņa is elsewhere expressed by the relationship of it to the others as like that of Prajapati to the gods.3 

It was of course quite inevitable that the eternal comparison of macrocosm and microcosm should here play its part, and so, in point of fact, we find the relationship of the breath as the principle of life in man, and the cosmic Prāņa, which is the wind, asserted in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. Nor are there lacking evidences of efforts to make Prāņa the one reality, as Atman was so made: Prāņa is identified with Prajapati, and also the Atman, but these views are late and isolated.5 The theosophy of the Atharvaveda with its cosmopolitanism, however, accepts the Prāņa readily as an expression of the universal, just as it accepts the Brahman, and as it sees in the Atman the same essence as the meaning of the universe. 

## 3. The Theory of the Sacrifice 

6 

Amid an infinity of varied details the Brāhmaṇas present a perfectly definite body of opinion as to the fundamental nature of the sacrifice, and in connexion with the sacrifice of the gods, the Asuras, the seers, and men. This theory is the most characteristic and independent part of the Brahmaņas : in the speculations as to the unity of the universe and the god in whom that unity finds expression, the Brahmaņas are only inheritors of the speculation of the Rigveda, but in the doctrine of the sacrifice they develop a theory which may have been held in germ at least in the age of the Rigveda, but which is not expressed there and which doubtless in considerable measure is a new creation. This is indicated by one fundamental fact; the sacrifice in the Brāhmaṇas is a piece of magic pure and simple: this is assuredly not the

attitude of the average seer of the hymns of the Rigveda. The turning into magic of the sacrifice is, we have seen, a conception which is secondary: the existence of magic as early as the sacrifice is one thing the converting of what was originally a sacrifice into magic is, like the art of black magic, a subsequent development.) 

In this theory of the universe there is much that cannot be called in any normal sense philosophical, but taken as a whole it is impossible to deny the name of philosophy to an ordered view of the universe, fully thought out, and within its fundamental limitations logical and complete. 

The basis of the whole system is the identification of the sacrifice with Prajapati, who is the creator par excellence. The exhaustion of Prajapati on creation is the exhaustion of the sacrifice: the work of creation is carried out with the aid of the sacrifices of various kinds: the danger to which the creatures whom he creates are exposed from the jealousy of the gods has to be overcome by new sacrifices invented for them, for Agni, the Maruts, even for Varuna. As the sacrifice, Prajapati is all creative, the gods and the Asuras arise from his upgoing and his descending breaths, from him are sprung men, the beasts, the plants and the trees, the minerals as well as the heaven and the earth and the mountains. But, while he is the all-father, still his nature as the sacrifice presents another relationship: he is father of Agni, but as the sacrifice Agni recomposes him and so is his father: and similarly with the gods as a whole. Moreover he is the creator of the sacrifice as well as the sacrifice he invents rite after rite to aid the gods in their struggles with the Asuras, and he was the first to invent the words used in the sacrifice and its varied forms. Moreover the sacrifice is not only Prajapati, but, as he is the first to sacrifice, so he is the first victim to be offered. He gave himself to the gods, and when he did so he created a counterpart of himself in the form of the sacrifice, and thus he redeemed his life from the gods. Yet again, as the first to sacrifice, he is the first to win the reward of sacrifice and to ascend to the sun.3 

Prajapati is not merely the creator of beings, but he reduces them to order from their confusion by entering them with form, Rūpa, and name, Nāman.4 The same feat is accorded to the Brahman by another text, and the form is identified with mind and the name with speech." These two figure in a contest for priority, the mind claiming that speech is but an imitation of it, while speech lays stress on the fact that it gives means of expression and communica- tion. But Prajapati decides, in favour of the mind, a struggle which is con- stantly taken up again in the Upanisads, and which has a famous parallel in the Roman legend of the contest of the members and the stomach. Speech,

however, remains of value and aid to Prajapati, and encourages him when he is in doubt or is wearied; he sends her forth to be revealed as the earth, atmo- sphere, and sky; she is his bride, to bear creation. She forms, therefore, a ground of contest between the gods and the Asuras: the gods win her by inducing the sacrifice to make overtures to her: 2 again the gods obtain by the offer of her the Soma from the Gandharvas: she brings back the Soma, and the two sides seek to retain her: the Gandharvas recite the Veda, the gods dance and sing and win her foolish heart by these base means. Again she flies from them and enters the wood, but the gods find her and she curses the wood for delivering her up: the trees, however, distributed her in the drum, the lute, and other places. At another time she is wroth with the Añgirases who prefer Surya to her as a sacrificial fee, and leaves the gods, remaining in the space between them and the Asuras and becoming a lioness. She is, however, won over. The distinction of speech was accomplished by Indra in return for a fourth part of the Soma: one quarter only is distinct, the other parts are the speeches of the beasts, the birds, and insects. Among men the speech is best in the country of the Kuru-Pañcālas, and the Asuras and barbarians alike talk a bad speech." 

To the other gods the sacrifice stands in a slightly different relation : Vişņu indeed is often identified with the sacrifice, but this idea, though im- portant, and doubtless an expression of the high standing in the pantheon of that god, is not in all probability much more than a recognition of this im- portance. Vişņu plays no very great part in the theosophy proper. The gods are, like the Asuras, children of Prajapati, but, though born of the nobler part of the god, are yet in physical strength weaker: they are, however, superior in science, and by their knowledge of the sacrifice they can defeat their rivals. They are essentially in the control of the sacrificer: the scers can even seize and hold them fast, for despite their possession of more than one body they can be present at only one rite at a time. Kutsa holds Indra by cords; LuŚa taunts the god who breaks free, but Kutsa with a new Saman brings him back: a later version of the legend, however, allows of the division of the god into his person and his greatness." The sacrifice or the threefold knowledge, which is the essence of the sacrifice, is the essence of the gods. The gods are lovers of the recondite,8 compact of truth, but the truth is nothing but exactness in the rites and the formulae of the sacrifice. To the sacrifice they owe the glory and power which is theirs, and, what is far more important, their

immortality, which they gain by the sacrifice: they are ever represented as being in fear of death, or Yama, or the ender, the year, death, Prajapati. Over the question of immortality they have desperate struggles with the Asuras, whom the Śatapatha often, and the PañcavinŚa once, make their elder brothers: in one case the gods were being steadily killed because Śuṣṇa, the Asura, had in his mouth the ambrosia, which Indra as an eagle stole from him, thus depriving his breath of the power to revive the smitten Asuras." The struggle with the Asuras repeats itself in innumerable forms: in one case Indra metamorphizes himself into a female jackal, and runs thrice round, winning the earth: 3 more famous is the use of Visņu, the sacrifice, as a dwarf to accomplish the winning of the earth from the Asuras,4 or more directly the three citadels of the Asuras, of iron, silver, and gold in the three worlds, are overthrown by the performance of the Upasad ceremonies.5 The gods also by the use of the new- and full-moon sacrifices force the Asuras to abandon the half month of waning moon, which they had occupied.

In the struggle the sacrifice plays a constant part: the gods are often aided by advice from Prajapati, and they apply themselves to severe penances to bring about victory, but the decisive thing in their favour is their knowledge of the correct mode of offering: the Asuras put the bricks in the fire altar with the mark below," in the preliminary rites they shave first the hair, then the beard, then the arm-pits; they offer a white victim born of a black mother, and these errors are fatal. They try magic but without success. The gods on their part cajole the chaplains of the demons, Śanda, Marka, and UŚanas, and are willing to break faith for victory: they detach the Rakṣases from the Asuras by promise of equal shares of the spoil, and they refuse them any share at all.10 They defeat the Asuras by the inability of the latter to find a feminine for the word five,11 but more often they have to fight hard battles. One story shows the Asuras seeking to build a fire altar to reach the heaven: Indra disguises himself, is allowed to put on a brick, and, when it is all but finished, he drags it away with the result that the altar falls.12 Even, however, within the divine family there are disagreements: the ancient Sādhya gods scem to have vanished from importance, 13 but the Adityas and the Añgirases are bitter rivals. Here, again, however, the value of knowledge of the sacrifice is the most important thing of all, and the Adityas are superior by far in this

and reach heaven before the Añgirascs, who have to serve them in place of being served by them. The same defective knowledge in the Añgirases leads them to require teaching from Nābhānediṣṭha, for which they have to pay dearly, and drives them to compromises with the Fathers.1 

The sacrifice is, however, the source of disagreement among the gods; the advantages of it are far too great to allow of the gods being content to share equally, and we hear that Vişņu, recognized as the first of the gods by reason of his sacrificial skill, makes himself hated for his pride, and the gods induce the ants to gnaw through his bowstring, so that his head is carried away. Even when, at a session in Kurukṣetra, it had been agreed to share the glory of the sacrifice, when it is attained by Soma," he appropriates it, and Indra readily destroys Namuci, when he finds that he can do so by stretching the words of his oath. The several residences of the gods is exclusive; they do not visit one another. They race one another for shares in the offering, and Indra and Vayu bear off the first places. 

The danger from the Asuras drives the gods to close union; they find that they must have mutual confidence, and they make a pact depositing their bodies with Varuna, on the understanding that he who violates it shall not be reunited with his forms. They are further compelled to resort to monarchy: they chose Varuna, Agni, or Soma, as king, but finally they perform the great consecration of Indra: the All-gods serve as heralds, the water of consecration is poured on by Prajapati, the Vasus assist at the east, the Rudras in the south, the Adityas at the west, the All-gods at the north, the Sadhyas and Aptyas in the centre, the Maruts and the Añgirases at the zenith." 

Despite the relations of the gods with the sacrifice, the sacrifice is by no mcans always loyal to them: it flees from them, taking now the form of Vişņu, now that of a Suparna bird, now that of a horse, or of a black antelope. Nor have the gods ever learned the whole art of sacrifice, even as men have not had it revealed to them: they pick up fragments of it from time to time. They may even have to seek knowledge from the Rṣis such as the snake seer, Arbuda Kādraveya. 

The place of the seers is in view of their relation to the sacrifice one of great importance: they are the means by which in the normal case men secure the essential knowledge of the ritual, and they are often indebted to the gods for it; Nodhas is taught a Saman by them in reward for his learning. They even declare that ŚiŚu Añgirasa was entitled to call the Fathers 'my children owing to his knowledge of the ritual, as in the Atharvaveda the seer may by insight win the position of father of his father. The Vaikhānasas, the seers, whom Rahasyu Devamalimluc slew at Munimaraṇa, were revived by Indra, and the same god revived Upagu SauŚravasa, whom his royal master Kutsa

had killed for persisting in the worship of Indra.1 Atri, on his part, saves the sun from the grip of the Asura Svarbhānu, the darkness disappearing as a succession of variously coloured sheep,2 and Bharadvaja warns the gods of the presence of the Asuras in the Ukthas, and so saves them.3 Vasistha con- strains the god Indra to show himself to him in bodily presence, and Indra must agree. Even if the gods seek to keep, as they sometimes do, knowledge from the seers, the latter triumph: they recognize that the gods have put the sacrificial post in upside down, and they find the Nigadas and Praisas, which they had at first omitted. The seer also can rely on the gods to enable him to convince men of his seerhood: Kavaṣa Ailușa, despised by other priests, is shown to be a seer by the conduct of the Sarasvati, which pays him reverence by flowing round him: 5 Vatsa walks triumphant through the fire, when his claim is disputed by Medhātithi." 

The mode of transmission of the knowledge of the rites explains why the ceremonial can be altered in important detail: the tradition is not established, and the theologians can discuss details even with royal personages, such as Janaka and AŚvapati Kaikeya. We are actually told of points on which the great Yajnavalkya held opinions differing from the normal, but which he did not carry into effect." 

In its aspect towards men the sacrifice is identical with the sacrificer, and it is identical also with the gods and with Prajapati. The sacrifice is essen- tially commensurate with men, and the conclusion is not doubtfully drawn that the sacrifice should be the sacrifice of man himself: he owes debts, to the Fathers to produce a son, to the seers to recite the sacred texts, to men in the shape of hospitality, and to the gods he owes himself, just as Prajāpati offered up himself. The conclusion would, therefore, appear to be that the perfect form of sacrifice should be suicide, but such an idea is not mentioned in the text of the Brahmanas, whether or not it existed then," as it in a sense certainly did in the Buddhist and Jain period. The idea, however, in its less developed form is expressed in various ways: the sap which is the essence of sacrifice is first in man, then it passes on to the other victims, the horse, the ox, the sheep, the goat, and even into the rice, which is thus not in itself worthy of sacrifice, but is still full of the sap of sacrifice. 10 Again the consecra- tion gives man a new and divine life, but it also means the handing over of his old body to the gods as an offering: this offering is not, however, performed: it is redeemed by the offering to the victim to Agni and Soma, which follows, and of that victim one view is that the man should not eat, since it is a

redemption of his own body.1 The human sacrifice is also permitted, not as suicide, but as a substitute for oneself, but this is a doctrine which has no direct support in the Brahmaņas, and may be a very late conception. The offering of man in the rite of the piling of the fire altar is recorded, but the sense of the redemption of the self is not there pressed, though it receives a classical form in the legend of ŚunahŚepa, who is to serve as a substitute for the offering of the king's son. Here, however, the motive of sacrifice is an ordinary case of the vow of some precious object to a god. 

2 

At the same time the sacrifice involves the death of the god in the form of the Soma or the victim. In the former case every effort is made to conceal the fact of death from the god: he is assured that he is being pounded, not for the sake of his death, but to attain the overlordship of the metres : or again one thinks, as one takes up the pressing stone, of one's enemy, and thus kills him and not the innocent Soma.3 The seller of the Soma is treated with insult and blows as an evil man, and the Soma himself is accorded the guest reception, as he moves to his death in the ritual. These remarks, how- ever, show clearly enough no serious or real feeling for the death of the god: they are products of speculation, not of deep religious conviction. 

5 

The sacrifice itself is supposed to undergo a perpetual series of deaths, and of coming again to life: in the etymology of the Brahmanas it is born through movement, hence it is yan-ja, which is as much as yajña. The sacrifice is the cater, for it lives on all creatures, but at the same time it is the universal prin- ciple of life. The libation offered in the fire is the life of the gods: the eating of the oblation by the priests is the life of men: the placing of the NaraŚañsa cups on the oblation holders is the life of the Fathers. Aforetime, indeed, the gods and the men and the Fathers used to enjoy the sacrifice together, and still they do so, but the difference is that the gods and the Fathers are no longer seen by the mortal eyes. The gods depend essentially on the sacrifice: Indra is hungry, and goes and asks for a gift: courtesy is due to them, and, therefore, when they are on the next day to receive the sacrifice, men do not eat but fast, since it would be discourteous to anticipate the feeding of the guests, who have been invited. The gods are so anxious for the offering that they consider eagerly whether they are to receive the sacrifice, or if it is to go to others. They know beforehand the intention of man, for he resolves with his mind, thence the knowledge goes to the breath, thence to the wind, and the wind wafts to the gods the news of the intention.8

sacrifice, regard men with some degree of dislike and suspicion there was even a time when men and gods lived together, but the gods were wearied and disgusted with the demands of men, who used always to ask them for what they wanted sans phrase,1 and therefore departed from the earth. It is the gods who have given men the evils of sleep, sluggishness, anger, hunger, love of dice and of women.2 The Rbhus, admitted indeed into the society of the gods, are disliked because of their human odour. Many are the devices adopted by the gods to prevent men following them into their immortality: they succeed in so far that an agreement with the god of death secures that men shall not attain immortality with their bodies." On the other hand men ever strive to imitate the gods and adopt in the sacrifice the habits of the gods, that especially of preferring the right side for the commencement of all rites as opposed to the left, which men are said to favour: the differences are of absurd detail.5 

The aim of the sacrifice is the world of heaven: the sacrifice is the ship which bears the sacrificer to that world, and the Brhat and Rathantara Samans are the two rudders of the ship, which bears the sacrificer to the desired bourne. From another point of view the sacrificer mounts to the heaven he does this by the special mode of recitation adopted: first he performs the text prescribed, pausing at each quarter verse, thus attaining this world; then by half verses, attaining the atmosphere; then by three- quarter verses, attaining the heaven; and then he says the whole verse, thus winning firmly the sun. If, however, he stops here, then he will definitely lose the world of earth, and the sacrificer is not prepared to enjoy immortality, until he has lived a full life: so he reverses the process, and returns to earth again. The same idea appears in the three steps of Visņu, which the sacrificer steps and thus wins the way to the heaven, but he also must take care to descend again." 

For the priest a very important rule must be noted: the sacrifice, as we have seen, dies eternally, and is eternally renewed, but this renewal must be conditioned by the giving of the fees to the priests: the sacrifice goes to heaven, the fee accompanies it, and by holding fast to the fee the sacrificer goes also." 

The man who sacrifices, without giving fees, is reserved for a dread fate: on him the Aptyas wipe off the sin which was com- municated to them, when Indra slew the three-headed son of Tvastr, ViŚvarūpa.8 

It is not only, however, by the sacrifice proper that the sacrificer attains the gods: the consecration is a process by which he is given new birth, and becomes an embryo, his actions and his clothing being based on the comparison

of him with such an embryo. His ordinary body, on the other hand, as we have seen, becomes an offering to the gods or by the gods. He himself is now in a state of extraordinary power, being filled with the sacrifice: if men cat his food, they take a third of any evil in him, those who speak ill of him a third, and the ants who bite him a third.1 

The motive which induces the sacrificer to sacrifice and to undergo the painful self-torment, which is necessitated by the rite of consecration, is the possession of faith, which the Kauṣitaki Brāhmaṇa 2 declares to be the source of the abiding character of the sacrifice. Now faith is clearly allied to truth, and precision or truth is intimately associated with actual sight, as opposed to mere hearing: the principle of the Brahmanas places sight as the highest source of truth. Faith in the sacrifice by gods and men is attained only by him who sacrifices with faith. Faith is, therefore, necessary in the sacrifice and also in the priest: if Vatsaprī Bhālandana was at first denounced as a thief by the seers, they were confuted by his winning faith through dis- covering the proper rite. A very odd story tells of the cows: they started a session for the purpose of obtaining horns: they received them after ten months, but some, not satisfied, not showing true faith, insisted on completing the year, where they won rich food, but lost their horns. Bṛhaspati, the priest of the gods, wins their faith by his discovery of the proper ritual.' The sacrificer must realize, if he is to prosper, the fixed truth of the rule that the gods receive the offering and he the benediction accompanying it. 

6 

The importance of faith is such that it renders the gods of no importance, for the man who has faith realizes that the sacrifice produces its results with- out need of the gods. Atri is one of those whose deity is faith, Craddhadeva: when he is in need he does not appeal to heaven, but invents the proper rite and disposes of his disabilities. The first father of men, Manu himself, is the believer in faith par excellence: his one aim is the sacrifice: with Iḍa as his daughter 10 he repeoples the world after the deluge, and he continues his long course of sacrifices even down to the point that he is anxious to sacrifice his own wife at the bidding of the demons, Trsta and Varutri, and has to be prevented from doing so by Indra, who induces him to let her go, when the fire had already been carried round her as a preliminary to the slaughter. But one version actually attributes to him the performance of the sacrifice at the suggestion of Kilāta and Akuli, the Asura priests.11 This faith in the sacrifice

is encouraged by the long accounts given of the men who flourished by the use, and by the still longer lists of things, which by the sacrifice can be achieved automatically for men by the priests. 

The need of faith is the more obvious in that the sacrificer at the sacrifice is hopelessly given up into the hands of the priests. He can by manipulation deprive him of his senses, of his life, of his wealth, of his kingdom; if he thinks of him as he says the Vașat call, he hurls upon him the thunderbolt which is contained in that call. The situation is repeatedly developed that the sacrificer may be hated by the priest, and the priest is then instructed how to ruin him the idea that this is wrong is absolutely derided. But, even if the priest is honest, the sacrifice is a dread thing, a dangerous wild beast, which must be propitiated: the gods themselves suffered terrible mischief by imprudence: Puşan's teeth were knocked out, Savitr's hands cut off to be replaced with golden ones, and Bhaga lost his eyesight. The priest Bhalla- veya made an error in the sacrifice: he fell and broke his arm. Aṣadhi SauŚromateya thought fit to substitute heads picked up anywhere for the five heads of the victims to be slain at the building of the fire altar, and paid for it by his life. The priest is, therefore, a person, who has difficult tasks to perform, and whose services should not be despised: the effect of any offer- ing is definite and precise, and it is idle to seek success in any haphazard 

manner. 

3 

The reward of the sacrificer for his efforts is, in the long run, one in the world to come: he may gain many desired things by the sacrifice and its manipulations in the present life, but these things are incidentals in the main offerings, a point in which they distinguish themselves from the occasional offerings, and from magic performances generally. The sacrifice is reduced in a sense to mere magic by the priests, but it is a performance which, unlike a magic rite or an offering set on foot for some definite object, must be per- formed regularly, and in it the profit acquired in this life is incidental, while the essential reward lies in the world to come. But this reward of immortality there is not to be construed in the sense that man should seek by an early death to obtain the world to come: on the contrary, in that world his place will be the better, the longer he lives: it is the aim of man not merely to achieve im- mortality, as eternal life hereafter, but also the full age of a hundred years, which is the allotted span of man. Those who die under twenty years of age by a weird conception attain as their abode the days and the nights, those under forty the half months, those under sixty the months, those under eighty the seasons, those under a hundred the year, and those over a hundred years the boon of immortality. The opposite of immortality is the repeated death,

Punarmṛtyu,1 of which men are in deep fear. The idea is that the passing once through death is not enough: even after death, when man is in enjoyment of the precious boon of immortality, he may be robbed of it, and have once again to face the terrors of dissolution, of which the Vedic Indian shows him- self most deeply afraid. The idea of a second death is, however, that of a second death in the future life, not of rebirth on earth and death in the ordinary sense, and the conception obviously could lend itself to the idea that the death might be not once only, but for numberless occasions: though the idea is actually found in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, where a distinction is made between those born for immortality after death in the world to come, and those born after death only to fall again and again into the power of death," nevertheless the ordinary conception is merely that of a repetition of death. Moreover it must not be forgotten that this idea occurs in the later Brāh- maņas such as the Kauṣitaki and the Śatapatha.3 

4 

The dead man, according to the agreement made by the gods with death, is not permitted to enter into immortality with his mortal body, which must be laid aside first. The way to the heaven despite that fact is even then not easy; the Adityas among others seek to keep back those who aim at heaven, and in addition there are en route two fires which try to burn up those whom they should burn, but let pass those whom they ought to let pass.5 In what manner the discrimination is made nothing is said, and, as we have seen, there is no other trace of the doctrine of a divine judgement in the Vedic literature. Beyond these powers, however, the dead is subject to the power of the sun, which is death: all creatures below it are subject to death, those above are free. The sun owes its position in the heaven to the gods who established it there, and keep it from falling away from its high place. The sun indeed for a time did not appreciate the high honour thus paid: he returned to earth, but found it in the clutches of death: he therefore praised Agni, and won again his home in the heaven. The just men are the rays of the sun, and the con- stellations are appropriated to those good men who go to the world of heaven." 

The dead, however, do not always go to the gods: they may also go to the Fathers, who dwell in the third heaven. The difference of the ways is not explained, and remains as mysterious as the Fathers themselves. Of them diverse accounts are given: they are the children of Prajapati, born before the gods and after the Asuras; they are the gods, who were slain in the fight with Vṛtra, brought to life as the Fathers. Incorporeal, they are compared to mind, as they cannot be seen. They correspond to the seasons, inter-

mediate between the day, which is appropriate to man, and the year of the gods: they correspond to the world of the atmosphere which comes between the earth and the heaven, but their world is not there. With the gods they have been at variance: their chief Yama1 used to deprive the gods of all that they had, until the intervention of Prajapati led to the settlement of the dispute. The gods are compelled to share with the Fathers the sacrifice. To their worshippers they are a somewhat dreaded band: 2 they must be appeased by offerings of the fringe of one's garment up to the age of fifty, and thereafter demand the offering of hair: their approach in the later period becomes closer and the need to buy off their demands by the redemption of oneself increases. When they come, it is said the Fathers take a man or they give one.3 They are also to be honoured by the sacrificer turning away his head, when they come to eat, even as the prince eats without the gaze of the people. They receive offerings for many reasons," to prevent their bringing death with them, to carry out the rule of following the usages of the gods who offered to them, to show benevolence to those whom the gods recalled to life, to elevate the sacrificer's own Fathers to a better world, and to make good the injuries which one inflicts on oneself by misconduct. 

6 

Of quite special interest among these speculations is the theory of the piling of the sacred fire, which has peculiarities of its own and deserves, there- fore, special consideration. The building of the fire altar, as we have seen, is no ordinary part of the ritual it is not an essential part perhaps of any sacrifice at all, and it is perfectly clear that the elaboration of the performance meant that it was one to be undertaken only occasionally, and then by a rich noble or prince or Brahman. The essence of the piling is clearly mystic: it has the purpose of carrying out in ritual form the essential act of the recon- struction of Prajapati, whose sacrifice as Puruşa has resulted in the creation of the universe in all its parts. This sacrifice cannot be regarded as a single definite act in time: it is rather a constant process, and therefore the dis- membered god must ever and again be renewed. The renewal is brought about by the reconstruction of Prajapati in the shape of the fire altar. The mass of significant members connected in the ritual is noteworthy the god himself is not merely identified with Purușa as is natural, but he is identical with Agni as fire the identification is carried out in detail: the fire altar is a year in building, and the fire-pan which the sacrificer has is for a year carried about by him. The bricks for the altar are prepared while preparation is made

of the fire-pan. The altar is arranged to represent earth, atmosphere, and heaven, and the same arrangement is devised in the fire-pan. The relations between Prajapati and Agni are not absolutely simple: Prajapati is the father of Agni, but also the son, since Agni restores him by the sacrifice, and the fire altar is the body of Agni, through which Prajapati is built up. Agni is also the child of the waters-which in their turn are created by Prajā- pati-and in the fire altar there is laid at the bottom a lotus leaf from which Agni is born. The bird shape of the fire altar is also often referred to as well as the mortal shape: the bird shape is clearly connected with the myth of Agni in lightning form bringing down the Soma from the sky: the Soma, moreover, as the sacrifice par excellence, is, as was inevitable, identified with Prajapati. The bird altar has, however, another aspect: the bird is to fly to the sky as the sacrifice, and with the bird the sacrificer who is identified with Prajapati is to attain the sky. In the piling of the altar the symbolism is carried out in the form of the gold disk, a symbol of the sun, which is placed over the lotus, and over which again is placed the golden image of a man, above whom lie in the first, third, and fifth layers of the pile the three naturally perforated bricks, representing the three worlds, through which the golden man can breathe, and through which the sacrificer must rise to the sun. The symbolism is effective: the ideas of the sun, the god Agni, the all-creator, and the sacrificer, as identical, and the nature of the sacrifice as leading to the world of heaven, are as efficiently produced by the ritual, as can be well conceived. 

The ritual as it is seen in the texts of the Black Yajurveda does not seem to go beyond these conceptions, but the Śatapatha Brahmana in the tenth book,2 doubtless a later addition to the text, which deals with the secret of the fire, develops the theme more philosophically. Prajapati is the year, for he is essentially, as the creator, time, and the year is at once the symbol of time, and the period in which the working of nature completes a round, and com- mences again. The year of the piling of the altar, and the carrying of the fire in the fire-pan by the sacrificer, has been already mentioned: the year is symbolic also of birth: Agni must be borne for a year in the firc-pan before he is brought to life as the fire on the altar itself. In the acts of carrying him in the pan the sacrificer takes Agni into himself and in the fullness of time he brings him forth from himself, in accordance with the doctrine that the father of Agni is Prajapati, the sacrificer himself. 

1 Oldenberg (loc. cit.) takes this as the essence of the rite, but though he justly insists on the non-popular character of the belief, he does not disprove the view of Eggeling, which is strongly supported by the Catapatha.

The Theory of the Sacrifice

time, and that the sacrificer is identical with Prajapati as time, has another and important side: the effect of time must be that, even if a man attain, as the piling of the altar will aid him to attain, the full life of a hundred years, still he must die, and he dies thus as death itself by his own hands, passing from the realm of material existence and its troubles and limitations to the eternal and abiding happiness of the life to come. But the Brahmana goes further than this and attributes to Candilya the doctrine that the ultimate essence of Prajapati, of the sacrificer, and therefore of the universe, is mind, from which develop speech, the breath, the eye, the ear, work, fire. The final reality is summed up as the self, made up of intelligence, with a body of spirit, a form of light, and an ethereal nature, which pervades the regions and upholds the universe, though devoid of speech and mental affects. Or, again, it is said that the Puruşa in the heart is as a grain of rice or granule of millet; like smokeless light, it is greater than the heaven, the atmosphere, and the earth, than all existing things: the self of the spirit is the self of man, and on passing away from life he attains that self. The changed spirit of the speculation in the course of time cannot be better illustrated than by this view, for the Taittiriya Samhita holds closely to the material view that the result of the offering in the next world is to secure the sacrificer his self and his breath there- in. The continuance as nearly as possible in the same condition as before of the existence on earth is the ideal of the Samhita: it has been transmuted by the wisdom of Śandilya 2 into a conception which seeks in its grand manner to solve the question of the existence of the universe and of the individual, by finding in them both the expression of a single spiritual principle. The im- pression of later growth thus engendered is supported, and made beyond reasonable doubt, not merely by the evidence of language, but by the fact that it is precisely this book of the Śatapatha which gives us the conception of the repetition, not once merely, of death in the world to come. The philo- sophy of the Brāhmaṇas is merging into that of the Upanisads. 

1 This connexion of birth and the year may 

conceivably be due to the old view- apparently Indo-European-of the year of ten months of gestation, which may be found in the Rigveda as in ancient Rome. Buddhist tradition insists on ten months precisely as the period of his stay in the womb (Win- disch, Buddha's Geburt, pp. 120 ff.); Hopkins (JAOS. xxiv. 19, 392) thinks references to the year are only periods within which, which would prove nothing for a ten months' year. view that the month is twenty-seven 

His 

or twenty-eight days in the popular reckoning is counter to the fact that birth is placed in the tenth month, not at the end, so that his month is too short. Probably the thirty-day month is all that is meant. Buddha is clearly a miraculous child.

Lindenau's suggestion (ZII. i. 48, n. 2) that AV. xiii. 3. 7 enunciates, as regards Rohita, the doctrine of the necessary mortality of the highest being, so far as involved in the empiric world, rests on a dubious translation.

The Philosophy of the Veda 

[Part V 

## 4. The Ethics of the Brahmaṇas 

In the strict sense of the word there is no theory of ethics in the Brāhmaṇa literature: the question of the nature of right action does not seem ever to have in any degree influenced the speculations of the curious spirits which framed the remarkable theory of which the outlines have been sketched above. It was, indeed, natural that the first element of the speculative thought of India should in the main be directed to problems of pure speculation, as was also the case in Greece, but the dominating feature in the philosophy of India is that the question of right conduct never attained the dignity of a subject to be propounded for serious consideration. In the Rigveda, while the hymns of creation and the other efforts to arrive at a philosophical account of the universe have beside them the expression in the hymns to Varuna of the pre- valence of moral order and the punishment of sin, the latter conception cannot be found in living force any longer in the Brahmaņas, a fact which has un- wisely been used as a proof that early India was exposed to Semitic influences later not felt.1 

The contrast here between Indian and Iranian development in religious matters becomes marked. Almost contemporaneously, perhaps, with the development of the thought of the Brāhmaṇas, we find Zoroaster engaged in decpening the meaning of religion for the people of Iran and founding a reasoned ethical system. While Varuna was losing ground in India, Zoroaster was developing the figure of Ahura Mazdāh, and depriving him of a rival by degrading Indra, his most serious competitor, as the god of war, to the rank of a demon.2 At the same time he removed from the character of the god any suspicion of uncertainty or caprice, such as still clings in the Rigveda to Varuna, whose noose and whose punishments appear to afflict at times even the innocent, and who is lord of a Māyā, which may be harmful as well as beneficent. Further, to Zoroaster the powers of evil loomed far greater than they had done to the carly Aryan mind, which, as in the Rigveda, knows indeed demons in abundance, but has no doubt in the power of the gods to overcome them, nor indeed of its own ability to win the favour of the gods. Vṛtra may be terrible, but he is never victorious, even if it would be unkind to assert that the Vedic demons exist merely for the gods to slay. Zoroaster accepts the impossibility of explaining the evil in the world, if it be assumed that Ahura is all-mighty, and that all has been created by him at his pleasure. On the contrary, the spirit of evil contends against the good, and only after desperate struggles can good be made to prevail. Moreover, in that struggle

89, 90; his etymologics of Vedic words need not seriously be considered; to that of Weber which derives Dula, one of the Kṛttikās, from a Semitic source no objection in principle is open, but 

the mere similarity of sound without identity of use is an utterly insufficient ground.

each man is free and morally bound to participate; it lies with him to further the conquest of evil; the deeds which he does are not merely personal; they serve to further the constant struggle of good against evil, and have cosmic value. Moreover, by his deeds does a man decide his future fate, in heaven or hell; the intervention of divine favour is excluded; the soul of the dead finds the Cinvat bridge wide or hopelessly narrow, according as his good or evil deeds prevail. Deeds, moreover, are essentially matters of practical utility and activity; prayers and offerings play their part, but the ideal of Zoroaster is the man who founds a family, performs his duties in his tribe, and furthers agriculture, performing useful works, as opposed to the nomad, who is the personification of the lie (druj). 

It may be that the stern conditions of life in Iran, where cultivation can be maintained only by unceasing toil, and the agriculturist must ever fear the incursions of the nomad, played a definite part in evoking the Zoroastrian outlook, nor, of course, must be ignored the individual character of his teaching, which never was fully assimilated in Iran, but was on the one hand exagge- rated and made absurd by the pedantic and crucl pursuit of detail, and on the other hand contaminated by the reintroduction of much of the old nature- worship of Iran.' In India under different conditions of climate and life and racial admixture, thought turned to speculation rather than to action, and inclined to sec unity, in lieu of regarding life as a struggle between the good and the bad. This contrast interposed for Zoroaster essential difficulties in regarding the world as a single whole, animated by one spirit; in India this was possible, and an absolute came to be recognized in which all was contained, whether good or bad, material or spiritual. Parallel with this movement was necessarily the decline from power of Varuna. Indra, as the god of the warrior and the people, remained powerful and popular: recent research, indeed, has shown how much alive, if in humble guise, he is to-day in northern India; first Prajapati, and then the Brahman absorbed the metaphysical elements of Varuņa's nature, while the growth in popularity of Yama as king of the dead limited his chthonian functions, so that the god who once was the chief guardian of the Rta sank to the function of lord of waters, which was his by right as a sky god, and which no other deity arose to wrest from him. Similarly the conception of the Rta passes away before the prevalence of the Brahman.

The development which places the Brahman in the first place is not achieved until the Upanisads, but it is in preparation during the period of the Brāhmaṇas, and it is in entire harmony with this spirit that these texts do

not develop any theory of morality. Indeed they do not normally inculcate morality even on merely empiric grounds. The myths which they recount and invent have this characteristic about them, that they are indifferent to the moral qualities of the acts: the gods are willing to commit sins freely for their own gain: they obtain the aid of the Rakṣases against the Asuras, and then they refuse to carry out their bargain to share equally with the former in the event of victory attending their united efforts. They are not ashamed to purchase the Soma from the Gandharvas by means of Vac, on the clear agree- ment arrived at between her and them that she will return to them when in- vited. They win speech from the Asuras by the low arts of solicitation and of dancing and singing in opposition to the pious recitation of the Veda by their rivals. They are constantly jealous of men, whom they refuse to allow to share with them the happiness of immortality without laying aside the corporeal body in death. But compared with Indra they are comparatively virtuous people: he, however, is quite unashamed: he makes a compact with Namuci and sets about to find a way of violating it, which he does with success his murder of ViŚvarupa, son of Tvaştṛ, is unmotived and wicked, and brings on him the guilt of slaying a Brahman. His amour with Ahalya is only accomplished by means of decciving the lady by adopting the form of her husband, and he gave over to the hyenas certain ascetics, an impure (amedhya) act.3 His adultery 4 is repaid in kind; for his own son, born of his thigh, Kutsa Aurava, takes advantage of his physical likeness, to win the favour of Śaci Paulomni, his father's wife. But, after all, what could be more degrading than the pictures of him hungry and begging a pricst for an offering, and then running about cake in hand, or bound by cords by Kutsa and urged by LuŚa to break away from this degrading servitude? 5 Even his own sub- jects, the Maruts, he plunders, justifying the royal habit of accepting loot plundered from the husbandmen. Prajapati appears as committing incest, and as adopting in the course of it an animal form, which is slain by the wrath of the gods concentrated in the form of Rudra, and in one rite he is formally reviled. The other gods are constantly jealous of one another; they have separate dwellings, and are moved by envy of one another rather than by love and friendship. The Vratyas insult Vayu and IŚana, who bar the world of heaven to them, but are shown it by Prajapati." The gods are essentially selfish; they give men the six evils of sleep, sloth, anger, hunger, love of dicing and of women.

The Ethics of the Brahmanas 

471 

It is the case that the gods are said to be essentially true,1 but the nature of the truth is not vitally moral: it is strictly confined to the precise carrying out of the rites and utterance of the formulae of the sacrificial ritual. Just as man's faith is not in the goodness of the gods, but in the efficacy of the sacrifice, if duly performed, so truth has no real moral content and in intellectual out- look is limited to the sacrifice, which, it must be admitted, is the reality par excellence for the Brahmans. But even this truth was not always the posses- sion of the gods: as children of Prajapati, the gods and the Asuras shared the patrimony of the father, which was Vac: they then indifferently spoke truth and falsehood: finally the gods abandoned the use of anything but truth, and the Asuras that of anything but falsehood. The gods, however, by saying nothing but the truth became feeble and impoverished, while by the opposite device the Asuras prospered like salt, the Indian equivalent of the green bay tree. But in the end the truth prevailed over the untruth, mainly, it would seem, because by the consecration offering, which they invented, the gods. extended truth and made it more effective. The moral apparently, therefore, is that in the long run exactitude in the sacrifice must prevail. 

The sense of the importance of exactitude in the rite is seen in the famous ritual of confession which is performed at the Varunapraghasas, when the priest, the Pratiprasthātṛ, asks the wife of the sacrificer with whom she consorts, other than her husband.3 It is essential that she should confess, since else it will go badly with her kinsfolk, an interesting assertion of the solidarity of the kin. The speaking out of the sin diminishes it, but not, it appears, by anything else than that it brings exactitude again into the order of things the wife commits an offence against Varuna, in that being the wife of one she consorts with another: the statement of the true fact removes the inexactitude, and repairs in so far the defect. It brings truth, i.e. reality, and order into the rite. The position of Varuna in this regard is of importance as it indicates in what degree the high conception of the Varuna of the Rig- veda has been degraded by the passage of time and the growing preference for the sacrifice. He is not regarded in the ritual, as it stands, as more than the power which resents the introduction of irregularity into the facts of the universe. 

The position of Varuna in this regard is also of interest on another ground: in the Brahmaņas Varuna is essentially a god of the waters, and this con- nexion of truth or reality and the waters must be traced to this relation. Hiranyadant Baida 5 is quoted as asserting that heaven rests on the atmo- sphere, the atmosphere on the earth, the earth on the waters, the waters

* A painful light is shed on priestly morality by the story of Yavakri, who was wont to summon to him any woman at pleasure, though intercourse with him 

meant death. He ultimately was slain by a Gandharva, after an Apsaras had been substituted for the wife of Yajnavacas, and after in madness he had cut off the heads of his cattle. * ŚB. ii. 5. 2. 20.

on truth, truth on the Brahman, and the Brahman on fervour. The waters are, it must be remembered, the primeval elements, they are a fact and they are also based on fact, on truth. The waters are also the conception of law : when the waters come to this carth, then all is in due and lawful order: when there is lack of rain, the stronger oppresses the weaker.1 The waters are also the reality itself," they are immortality, they are faith, they are the sacrificc.5 Man must use them to sprinkle himself with water, in order to become ritually pure. The performance of the bath provides even consecration and fervour, for the gods placed consecration in the waters. Morcover, the sap of the sacrifice is in the waters and by it they flow. The impurities of men do not affect the waters themselves, in accordance with the pact they made with the gods. The Darbha grass owes its power to the presence in it of the waters. The waters are as a thunderbolt, and they must be propitiated with suitable words to avoid injury by them. They are extremely powerful to destroy the Rakṣascs, and they are, therefore, benevolent if managed well they form the atonement" for every harsh deed in the sacrifice, and on the other hand, when appeased, they confer glory and power on the king at the royal consecration. 

8 

6 

But the identification of the waters with truth or reality is not the only identification: the earth is also truth, for it is of all the worlds the most obviously genuine.10 Gold again is reality; lead, being neither iron nor gold, is a mere appearance.11 Truth, therefore, is nothing but a species of existence, which the term used, Satya, also properly expresses. But the most important side remains ritual accuracy: the best pair is the union of faith and truth as ritual accuracy.12 The sacrifice is formally identified with the truth, and so is the threefold Veda, and the Brahman as holy writ, to which conception we must refer the doctrine of Hiranyadant Baida that truth rests on the Brahman. More simply, however, the rite is simple fact: the eye is asserted to be truth, because, unlike the mind and speech, it is not prone to give false witness. From this fact, however, there is deduced a doctrine of some value for the guidance of the sacrificer: as in the case of the wife and her lovers, he must see that in the rite he shall duly bring himself into harmony with the truth by the use of true speech.13 When he is about to undertake a vow, he should realize that he passes from the inaccuracy of ordinary life to the exactitude, which is characteristic in ritual of the god, and, at the end when he lays down the vow, he ceases to be under the bond of accuracy. But in the rite he does not say so openly: 14 he contents himself with the declaration that he is once more as he was-that is one who lives among men, whose nature is inaccuracy.

A difficulty, however, arises in practice: if the rule of truth is laid down absolutely as incumbent always on him who has established the sacred fires, what will happen to him? What man can always speak the truth? Aruņa AupaveŚi, when urged to establish his fires, put the point plainly that he was being condemned by this instruction to silence, as no one could avoid speaking what was false.1 

2 

3 

In the view of Oldenberg, truth denotes something more than mere accuracy, and it is probable that there is justice in this contention, if it is not pressed too hard. It is characteristic of this period that the terms Satya and Anṛta come to form a formal contrast. As we have seen, in the Rigveda it is impossible to accept the view that Rta and Satya, order and truth, are identical, and it would probably be erroneous to assume that the contrast of Satya and Anṛta denoted that in this period the term Anṛrta had lost any con- nexion with the idea of order and righteousness. It may perhaps be said that, while Anṛta tends to be weakened into meaning no more than falsehood, Satya takes on an additional tinge of value 5 and it is certain that Rta still means order, though here and there it is tempting, but probably misleading, merely to render it truth". 

6 

Varuna is the deity who is constantly ready to punish inaccuracies in the ritual his cords and his knots make him admirably fit for this purpose, and the errors in the offering are at once seized hold of by him. By sacrificing in the southern fire, the sacrificer secures the seizing by Varuna of his rival, but the offering if made on the Ahavaniya would entail the same fate for the sacrificer himself." Vişņu, on the other hand, repairs the errors of the sacri- fice, and does not seize on them as the time for assailing the author of the mistakes. If the rule that a father should not be transgressed against is asserted, and traced to Prajapati's offspring being punished by Varuna for transgress against him, it is at once found that the transgress was a ritual one." 

In Varuna's house when the gods make mutual pledge of loyalty at the Tanunaptra they deposit their forms: here again the act is a ritual performance.10 

8 

But the most convincing evidence of all regarding the almost purely ritual character of goodness in the view of the Brahmanas is the fact that their conception of torment in the other world is inextricably bound up with the correct practice, or the failure to follow the correct practice, of the ritual.

The Philosophy of the Veda

[Part V 

After death man is weighed in the balance to test the good and the bad, an idea which is evidently not a primitive speculation but a late develop- ment,1 suggested, it may be, by the ordeal of the balance which is known in the later literature: it is, however, at least possible that the idea is no more than one of the passing conceptions of the Brahmaņas, possibly a faint echo of the Iranian conception of judgement. But we cannot for a moment assume that the distinction depends on ordinary morality. The real nature of the idea is shown by the story of Bhṛgu, son of Varuna, who was so proud that the god for his improvement made him unconscious and sent his spirit to see the world to come. Of the sights seen by Bhrgu there are two versions preserved in the Śatapatha and the Jaiminiya Brāhmaṇas: 4 according to the latter, he first saw a man devouring another man whom he had cut up in pieces; in the second place he saw a man who was eating another while the latter uttered cries of misery; in the third place he saw a man who was eating another, who, however, kept entire silence; in the fourth place he saw two women guarding a treasure; and in the fifth place two rivers, one of blood guarded by a naked man armed with a mace, and one of butter guarded by men of gold, who with cups of gold draw from it what they desire. Then he saw, last of all, five rivers covered with lotuses blue and white, with waves of honey, where the dance, the song, and the lute resounded, where Apsarases disported themselves, and sweet fragrance was wafted. The Śatapatha version differs in detail: Varuna sends Bhrgu simply on a journey to cure him of pride: he visits the four cardinal points and one of the intermediate spaces. He sees only five instead of six sights, and these five are reduced to four by the fact that the first is really reduplicated, the first being the vision of men who were cutting in pieces and the second of men who were cutting only. The two rivers of blood and of butter, and the five of gold are omitted in toto, and the nude man figures in the episode of the two damsels. The explanation of these visions is given to the chastened Bhṛgu by his father Varuna the first exhibits the fate of those men who, without offering the Agnihotra and without true knowledge, cut wood in the world: the trees take thus revenge on them in the world to come; the second is the fate of men who without proper ritual knowledge kill and eat animals; the third applies in the case of eating herbs. The other three visions are faith and lack of faith respectively; the river of blood is the blood of a Brahman, the black man is the sacrifice, the river of butter is formed from the waters used at the offering; the five rivers are the worlds of Varuna. If a man performs the due offering, the trees in the world to come do not eat him, nor animals, nor rice and barley: his offerings go neither to faith or lack of faith: he avoids the river of blood, he gains the river of butter. The same idea appears in the Kaușitaki Brāhmaṇa

also the animals revenge themselves on man in the next world, unless he adopts the proper form of rite.

A final proof of the brutal morality of the priest can be adduced in the position assigned to women: woman in India has always suffered much from all religions,1 but by none has she been so thoroughly despised as by the Brahmans of the period of the Brāhmaṇas. The insolence of the question at the Varunapraghāsas has been noted: however much it may be explained away, it remains an insult, since it can only be justified on the theory that infidelity in a wife is not surprising; a priest like Yavakri takes toll of every woman he fancies at pleasure. The wife is the half of man, but this is merely due to the fact that, without her, the man cannot secure the essential off- spring to continue his family, and perform the offerings to him after death. The Maitrāyaṇī Samhita 3 is very outspoken in its view of women: the three things which are connected with Nirṛti, Dissolution', are dice, women, and slumber the reality is the sacrifice, women is lack of truth. Three invitations addressed in a loving tone will overcome the most circumspect women, and their bad taste prefers the dance and song to the recitation of the Veda. Their power of wheedling secrets out of their husband is referred to in con- temptuous terms.5 As compared with men they are always inferior: woman is the inferior part of the sacrifice: she is ritually impure, and must be covered with a girdle. They have been smitten by the gods with the thunderbolt of the butter and hence they are emasculated, they cannot control themselves or an inheritance: 7 even if many women are together and there is but a small boy, he takes precedence of them all. They are inferior even to a bad man," and their inferiority is marked by the ceremony on birth when the child is brought to the father.10

On the other hand, it would be wholly unfair to ignore the fact that the Brāhmaṇas do not encourage or contemplate many crimes, which have been committed in other rituals. The exposure of female children which has been asserted to be mentioned in the Brahmaņas is a mere error.11 The Brahmaņas, further, never actually prescribe a human sacrifice: the tradition of such an offering in the piling of the fire altar is handed down, and the name of the last sacrificer is given, but, though the Brahmaņa 12 does not show any profound horror at the past, and may possibly have regretted the change, it must be remembered that this rite was always a rare and exceptional one.

[Part V 

slaughter of animals was, of course, prescribed by the rite, but the use of animals for food was the basis of this slaughter, and the doctrine of Ahinsa is one which has never even in India received full sanction. The accusation of cruelty in the slaying of the victim, which has often been brought against religious rites, is not specially proved for the Brahmanas: the primitive means of slaying victims available probably caused suffering to the animals, as in the Jewish practice of to-day, but that there was any deliberate lack of humanity is contrary to the desire of the sacrificers to avoid anything un- seemly, which might indicate the reluctance of the victim to depart from the world. The Omophagia of the Dionysiac rites is not in the slightest degree hinted at in the Indian sacrifice. 

The ritual admittedly contains several rites based on fertility magic, which to modern taste are revolting, and sometimes even horrible, such as the action of the queen at the horse sacrifice. The idea that these rites were invented by the Brahmans, as is suggested even by Victor Henry,' must be rejected as an error: the beliefs so expressed are primitive and natural, not priestly, and the only action of the priests in regard to them was doubtless the adoption from the popular belief of these usages and their decoration with the literature of the priests.2 Even in regard to these usages it is fair to note that there arose among the priests a disinclination to perform the ritual. In the Śankhayana Śrauta Sutra & there is recorded the view that the rite, by which a pair, or pairs, in the course of the Mahavrata at the winter solstice went through the process of intercourse, ought not to be performed, whether because it was antiquated or too extensive is uncertain. That such a view should have been taken in the face of the prescription of the rite in all the ancient texts is creditable and worthy of notice. It is only to be regretted that it stands almost alone, for the omission in certain texts of the rite of beating the king on the occasion of the royal consecration may be explained otherwise.

3 

Moreover, we must admit that the ritual books show sometimes the most unedifying indifference to morality. The Jaiminiya Brāhmaṇa 5 actually records, without disapproval apparently, a rite, the Gosava, in which the per- former pays the ox the compliment of imitating its mode of existence, including incest with mother, sister, and female relative, though it records

that Janaka of Videha did not carry out the rite, when he understood its nature, and the Śibi king, who did, concluded that it was a ritual which should be performed in old age only, when the action it prescribed might be more excusable in certain regards. The priestly nature of the rite as it stands is shown by the reward promised, the world of the Ox, a reference to that creature in its Atharvan 1 form as a cosmic equivalent of Prajapati. Not less brutal is the cynical rite 2 provided when a man desires his wife to have lovers in plenty during his absence from her side.

, 

A more favourable view of the morality of the Brahmaņas is taken by Hopkins, who holds that, while in the case of the PañcavinŚa the Saman and the rite make the gist of the Brāhmaṇa's religion, it remains true that there is a real ethical foundation for this religion. The evidence adduced, however, is scanty; untruth is indeed reproved, and the 'hant' follows the slayer, while taking too much is like swallowing poison. But the sacrifice does away with sin automatically; even a sinner by means of wealth gets to the top; goods wrongly accepted can thus be made proper and fit.5 The conception of sin is mechanical: all slaying, even of demons such as Vṛtra, brings the taint of bloodshed, whether justified or not, the fault of the sacrifice passes to him who blames it, as does a third of the sin of the initiated to any one who speaks ill of them." Evil repute (aŚlīlā vāc) fastens on every killer, irrespective of the nature of his decd. A false accusation makes a man, despite his inno- cence, avoided by the gods, but the priests can make his sacrifice acceptable to them, and it is wisely said that the false accusers are the real sinners." Untruth is described as a hole in the voice which can be filled by adding a syllable to a verse. We find also the dubious doctrine of sins caused by the gods, by the Fathers, by other men or by ourselves', which the com- mentator explains as evils inflicted by the gods or Fathers in respect of neglect, but not with certain accuracy. Moreover, insistence is laid on the fact that sacrifice increases proportionately man's welfare materially and spiritually.10

C 

The Brāhmaṇa, however, contains one doctrine of interest,11 intended to explain the fact of the grief (Śoka) which is the lot of the harlot, the eunuch, and the sinner. It adapts the old doctrine of the grief of the earth and sky on parting; Indra removes grief from the earth into the harlot, from the atmosphere, which is the weakest of the worlds,12 to the eunuch, and from the sky to the sinner; hence their desires are unattainable, and, even if one obtains some part of desire, he attains also a portion of grief.

The Philosophy of the Veda 

[Part V 

The association of purely ritual acts with morality is conspicuous even in the Upanisads,1 and it is not surprising that the Brāhmaṇas remain in hopeless ignorance of the specific character of morality. As in the sphere of the sacrifice, we find confusion of the ideas of divine intervention and magic operation. Thus Varuna seizes the doer of evil, and therefore, since the evening is Varuna's time, one should then on no account utter falsehood.2 But, having spoken truth in the evening, it makes no difference how much falsehood one speaks thereafter; the original truth, applied at the proper moment, continues to have, we may say, an abiding and dominant effect.3 Untruth and impurity can be washed away by water, or wiped away by appli- cation of the sacred Darbha grass. The same independence of morality is seen in the new doctrine of the fruit of ritual works, independent of divine action, and the view that man is born into the world hereafter which he has made for himself. The germ of the ideas lies in the gifts and sacrifices (iṣṭāpurta) of the Rigveda with which one is united in the world to come, without any divine intervention. We have here a germ whence later appears the conception of the automatic working of Karman. 

4 

6 

One idea of importance, however, can be faintly traced. Impurity, of course, is largely ritual, and a new-born child is ritually impure. On the other hand, we find it definitely asserted that if one perform a certain ceremony of purification one will be left with no more guilt than is in a toothless child, and a similar assertion is made of a child on birth.' These assertions clearly admit that sin is not to be ascribed to a being incapable of volition, and in the same strain of thought we have the assertion of the sin which accrued to Soma because he had merely the intention of oppressing the Brahmans. But these are isolated utterances, we have no reason to suppose that there was recognized any general doctrine of the necessity of volition to create responsibility; the opposite clearly appears from the tale of the charioteer who by inadver- tence killed a Brahman boy, for the discussion of the incident deals only with the point whether the charioteer, or his master who was riding in the chariot, was to bear the sin of the slaughter."

from the uses of the Rigveda which attest the development of moral concep- tions. The conception of Rta as righteousness, as has been seen, is less pro- minent; but the term itself in the negative form, Anṛta, has established itself as the opposite of truth, Satya, which largely supersedes Rta. The old conception of law, Dharman, persists, but there appears beside it the later formation Dharma, which the Catapatha Brāhmaṇa 1 formally personifies. The king now is hailed as the guardian of the Dharma and to him who has the power men resort in matters of Dharma," whence later we have the Dharma Sūtras with their inextricable mixture of ritual, of domestic practices, and of civil and criminal law, all matters which Dharma is wide enough to cover. Vrata in the Rigveda denotes either the will of the god, or the usage of the man who obeys that will, nor does it cease to have this sense in the Brahmanas, for the committer of a breach of the established moral laws can be called one who turns from Vrata (apavrata). But it tends to be specialized to denote the course of observance specially undertaken by an individual for some special purpose, and the Brāhmaṇas, like the Upanisads and the Sutras, know of many curious Vratas. 

There is development also in the terms for good and evil. The old words Vasu and Cri continue to denote material prosperity, the earlier sense of the latter term as appropriate to beauty becoming less and less prominent, and the wicked man is still Papa. But from its use with terms of motion Sadhu comes to denote what is right,5 and Punya slowly develops, in lieu of its purely unethical sense of 'fortunate' or 'lucky', the implication of goodness, as evinced in prosperity. Both terms are fated to have an important develop- ment later, for they are used in those passages of the Upanisads which touch on the essential connexion of the position of man in life as affected by the merit or demerit of his deeds in a previous birth.? 

6 

But though terminology shows a certain advance in view, it remains the case that nothing architectonic arises in the way of conception of good and evil. Truth and falsehood are sometimes set against each other, and once truth, good fortune, and light are opposed to untruth, evil, and darkness. But we miss entirely even what might have been expected, a living effort to combine the opposition of gods and Asuras with the conception of good and evil. Goods remain essentially mundane; the prayers offered are especially for temporal things, prosperity for the crops, the cattle, the boon of children, harmony in the realm, or pre-eminence for the Brahmans, or the restoration of an exiled

king, acuteness of the senses, and rarely the world of heaven.1 Occasionally the idea appears that all objects of human desire are of minor importance; the chariot of the gods is yoked for the world of heaven, that of men for mere desires. Similarly knowledge is stated to attain a result which neither gifts to the priest nor asceticism can obtain. But this is not the prevailing idea, nor are prayers necessarily moral. Man may sacrifice and pray to be freed from reproach of murder, from persecution by evil spirits, but also to be safe in violating for a year his oath, without meeting punishment from Varuņa.3 

It is the conviction of the Brāhmaṇas that life on the earth is on the whole a good thing; for a man to live out his length of days is the ideal, and such traces of discontent as appear are mainly in regard to the doubt that man must feel whether he has even a year more to live. If he must dic, then the sacrifice avails to carry him to the world of heaven, but he is never normally anxious to precipitate this result; if a rite carries him to the sky, it ends, none the less, in restoring him to the solid earth. Besides death there are other evils; hunger, dice, women, sleep, cause sin as does untruthfulness; these are of the nature of things, for Prajapati is untruth and darkness as well as truth and light; but no question is yet raised as to the compatibility of the existence of the creator and evil. Nor is there any effort to evolve a complete code of moral rules; a man owes sacrifice to the gods, Vedic study to the seers, offspring to the Fathers, a triad of obligations, but also hospitality to friends; the duty of truth, as we have seen, is repeatedly asserted. But of the three duties, which in an Upanisad arc enunciated as the three da's, generosity, self-restraint, and sympathy (datta, damyata, dayadham), only the first is heartily recognized in the Brahmanas. Gifts are a bridge to the heaven, a gift of a cow protects one's life, that of a garment prolongs it; the food destroys him who eats what he should give to others the priests par excellence. It is only in an Aranyaka that we have the wise counsel that a man should be able to say 'No' as well as 'Yes' and to give only at the right moment. Self-restraint is asserted in one passage of the gods,10 but sympathy is a virtue of the Upanisad period.

In the undeveloped state of ethical views it would be hopeless to expect any political philosophy, nor have we any. The existence of the castes is taken for granted, and their origin attributed to divine creation whether in the version of the Puruşa hymn of the Rigveda or in some variant form.11 The duties and privileges of the castes are often mentioned incidentally, occa- sionally in more completeness, but there is no effort to develop a theoretic 1 TS. ii; Caland, Over de Wenschojets (1902). 2 KS. xxii. 1; CB. x. 5. 4. 16.

version of the matter. The Brahman is required to be of Brahmanical descent, to follow an appropriate course of life, to possess renown for learning, and to be engaged in the spiritual advancement of the people. In return he is entitled to receive honour and presents, and to be exempt from oppression and the death penalty.1 The Kṣatriyas are to protect the people, and show considera- tion for Brahmans, while the commonalty in its subjection to these two castes is not very much better off than the Śūdras, children of the Asuras or of non- existence, save in so far as they are sharers in the rites of the twice born. It is assumed that, in the perpetuation of the due subordination of the castes, there is assured prosperity for the people; no attempt is made to demon- strate or render this theory plausible. In the relations of the king and his Purohita there is an element of contract, with which may be compared the effort of the Buddhists to base the existence of caste relations and the state on contractual agreements as well as on creation myths, but the Brahmans insist in the ceremony of the royal consecration that they own no king, for Soma is their overlord, an assertion of the superiority of the priestly to the warrior class doubtless more honoured in theory than in practice, though not without actual importance. 

Of the origin of kingship itself we have variant versions, while the con- dition of anarchy is once vividly described. On one theory 5 Indra owes his kingship among the gods to Prajapati's favour, who at first made him the most inferior, but later conferred on him his own lustre and made him over- lord, of the gods. Another version makes him the chosen of the gods, including Prajapati, by reason of his eminent qualities of mind and body. Yet another' makes the gods choose Soma as their king, because they felt that they owed their defeats at the hands of the Asuras to their lack of a sovereign. Or again they consecrate Varuna,8 their brother, because they see in him the form (rupa) of their father, Prajapati. Among men the rule of the Rajanya is explained on the ground that he is the representative of Prajapati, thus being entitled, though one, to rule over many. It is, however, dubious whether this should be regarded as precisely a doctrine of the divine origin of the kingship in any specific sense; at any rate there is no effort to expound a doctrine of hereditary divinity in the Brāhmaṇas, and the ceremony of the Rājasuya, or royal consecration, hints at recollections of an elective kingship by the consent of the people.10 The inviolability of the king is asserted,11 and his duty to assert and defend the law,12 Dharma, but no grounds of a philoso- phical character for his obligations are alleged.

The Philosophy of the Veda 

Modes of Thought and Categories 

[Part V 

Despite their interminable controversies, of which the Brāhmaṇas contain many hints, there is no evidence of the development of any logical theory. In a late text, the Taittiriya Aranyaka,1 we find, indeed, an enumeration of four means of attaining correct knowledge, tradition (smṛti), perception (praty- aksa), communication by one who is expert (aitihya), and reasoning (anumāna). This occurs in a verse to be used in connexion with the piling of the Aruṇa- ketuka fire, a late rite, and it has epic parallels, showing that it represents a late popular view. It is obvious that it is unscientific, for tradition and communication obviously are not distinct sources, and what really was meant by reasoning does not appear, nor is the term otherwise defined in the Brāhmaṇas. 

3 

2 

The real distinction in the Brahmaņas is between what is normally per- ceived (pratyakṣa) and what is beyond mere perception (paroksa), and, as the gods prefer the latter, so men recognize that mere appearances are not the essence of reality. Hence the foundation is laid for the doctrine of forms (rupa) which lie at the basis of the interminable and seemingly absurd identi- fications of the texts. Philosophically the view has a real importance, for it points to the development of the pantheistic doctrine which asserts the unity of the individual self and the universe; the individual is no more than an aspect of the universal. What is obvious is not what is ultimately true; what is pratyaksa for men is paroksa for the gods; what is paroksa for men, is pratyakṣa for the gods. Hence, although the importance of sight as a source of knowledge is asserted, at other times the emphasis is laid on the necessity of thought to penetrate reality, but this stage is not consciously reached until the Upanisad period. In the Brahmanas what we find is the assertion of special insight through the power of asceticism, which enables the seers to behold the rising of the metres to the heaven. By asceticism or even without it the seers discover the sacred texts and the rites, for already these are regarded as beyond human creation or invention; they must be seen, learned, or found, not created. Indra himself in visible form reveals the Stomabhaga formulae to Vasiṣṭha, a Saman converses with KeŚin Dälbhya, a voice unseen instructs Devabhāga, a golden bird, a maiden possessed by a Gandharva reveal secret lore. Śrautarși Devabhāga discovers the right way to divide the sacrificial victim, but dies without revealing it to any one; a supernatural being tells it to Girija. The great texts trace their revelation to such gods as Aditya, Indra, Prajapati, or Brahman, though no purposeful action is ascribed in this regard to these deities.

Modes of Thought and Categories 

483 

Against tradition of this kind human ingenuity is valueless; Yājñavalkya, always an innovator in spirit, asserts that there are two kinds of created things; the Rc verse says three, and its authority is conclusive.1 Neverthe- less human thought must have an outlet, and it expresses itself in the deep consideration of topics, styled Mimänsä, the desiderative form of man, 'think', a term so common that it can be omitted, the genitive case alone standing to denote the object of investigation. At other times Mimänsä fares less respectfully; suggestions that a rite should be carried out in other than the established manner may be dismissed as mere speculation. Another term, Vicikitsa, also a desiderative formation, denotes the doubt which prompts inquiry, while the final result is denoted by Sthiti, the station attained. 

Unfortunately this consideration does not penetrate to facts, but lives largely in a world of fancy, unrestrained by regard for reality and with extremely slight sense of the limitations of knowledge. If the Taittiriya Samhita 2 in a moment of sanity admits the possibility of doubt whether a man really exists in yonder world or not, that candour is accidental and episodic. The theologians of the Brahmanas are not prepared to admit to ignorance of any sort, and revelation reduces them to interpretation at their pleasure, aided by the fact of the bizarre nature of the revealed texts. If the waters can practise asceticism, it is not surprising that speech can speak standing in the seasons, or that the sacrificial consecration can be pursued by the gods with the aid of the seasons, or that the ascent of the metres to the sky should be visible. The texts operate freely, as already in the later Rigveda, with the conceptions of being or not-being, but they fail to make any serious progress in discovering effective categories. The cardinal points and the year lead very slowly up to more adequate conceptions of space and time, and the two seem endlessly confused even in the Upanisads. The conception of causality remains wholly obscure; instances of natural causation are recorded, but equally we have the most fantastic conception of cause and result, and it is significant that neither Kārya, 'result', nor Kāraṇa, ‘cause', appears. Other important technical terms are missing; there are no expres- sions for relation in general or conditions, the expressions Visaya, 'object', Viparyaya, opposition ',3 Pravṛtti, activity', and Nivṛtti, cessation from action', are wanting. On the other hand, certain advances are made; the adjective prakṛta in the Catapatha Brahmana reveals the existence of the conception Prakṛti, ground form', later famous in the Samkhya; difference is expressed by Nanātva, though the later Bheda occurs only in the morc recent Upanisads; the nature of any thing is expressed by a derivative in tva or tā, and in a late passage in the Taittiriya Aranyaka the use, later established, of an abstract in the ablative as giving the ground of some result, is actually found. The terminology of the Brāhmaṇas does not know any

general expression for sensation or perception, compelling needless repetitions, which the Upanisads also adopt, but phrases such as ' In each season there is the form of all the seasons' show efforts at expressing general conceptions.1 

When no clear distinction had been made between personal and impersonal, and anything whatever might be conceived as active and living, it was in- evitable that little progress could be made with formal definitions. We have instead endless identifications; the sacrifice is man or the year or anything else which may suit the moment, and, if the horse character (aŚvatva) of the horse is explained, it is merely that it came into being from the eye of Prajapati when it was swollen (aŚvayat). Some of these etymologies were probably recognized as absurd by their makers, but others not, despite the fact that there was already developing itself an acute system of linguistic investiga- tions, which reveals itself in the early appearance of terms for number (vacana), case forms (vibhakti) and so on, and in investigations as to euphonic combina- tion and phonetical peculiarities. When the priests set to work to define, they normally merely give fanciful identifications, as those of Agni VaiŚvānara, which they propound to AŚvapati Kaikeya. Nevertheless, occasionally they reveal more acumen; the vague term Kratu is defined; When a man wishes, May I do that, may I have that," that is Kratu; when he attains it, that is Dakṣa.' 4

When definition is in so feeble a condition, classification naturally fares no better. The love of numbers already appears as a dominant factor; the term Prāņa is subdivided into five elements, among other divisions, and these five are obviously incapable of presenting any intelligible picture to the minds of the priests; moreover, under the same title we find not merely varieties of breathing, as is natural, but the quite different set of five, mind, speech, breath, sight and hearing. But other numbers and divisions are also found; we have here signs of that love of numerical enumerations which is seen in its full development in the Añguttara Nikaya of the Pali Canon or the Ekottara- gama of the north, and which on one view has given the Samkhya philosophy its distinctive name. 

Reasoning, indeed, we find, but of a peculiar character. Its logical value consists merely in its systematic form, marked by the use of the particles 5 vai and khalu vai, the former of which marks the general principle asserted as the basis of the reasoning, the latter the identification which renders the general principle apposite. Thus, if it is necessary to explain why during the consecration the person consecrated has milk as his sole food, the principle is asserted, By milk indeed (vai) embryos wax'; the application follows, 'Now indeed (khalu vai) the consecrated person is as it were an embryo', and the conclusion is arrived at, 'In that he has milk as his food, he causes

himself to wax.' Oragain1 we have, 'By means of the Stoma the gods prosper in this world; the Vatsapra is a counterpart of the Stoma; in that he pays homage with the Vatsapra, so does he win prosperity in this world.' The principles and their application alike rest on mere assertion, and it is seldom that they are self-evident. Naturally, when deductive processes are so feebly represented, there is no effort at induction, which is found only in the Upani- şads, and even then merely in the form of arguments which exhaust a series of possibilities, assumed, not proved, to be exhaustive, and so assumed tacitly, no expression of the assumption being requisite. There is a further advance in the Pali canon, but that is of still later date."

With thinking still so undeveloped, it would be impossible to expect any serious advance in the construction of categories to aid in the comprehension of the world. The distinction between what has and what has not life and power of action is not made; the gods, demons, men, plants, beasts of all kinds, are no more alive than the atmosphere, wind, rain, storm, minerals, the sacrifice and its utensils, numbers, metres, qualities or emotions. The holy power and the lordly power are concrete activities, like the strength (virya) of a man; his greatness (mahiman) is even said along with his Atman to constitute him. The anguish caused to the victim in the slaying adheres to the roasting spit, and if placed on earth will penetrate to the earth; guilt (enas, āgas) is a substance which the god can carry with him; a man's good deeds are within the altar, his evil deeds without it. Equally substantial are conceptions such as right, asceticism, evil, death, immortality, truth, false- hood, space and time. These two are normally represented by the cardinal points and the year; gradually we find the development of AkāŚa, which denotes the vacancy between objects, such as the Antariksa between heaven and earth, but it is also material, as the Upanisads frankly recognize, and of Kāla, which primarily means the suitable moment for any thing, but becomes regarded as a cosmic power, similar to the year, in the Atharvaveda.

Even the more imposing conceptions of being and not-being prove to have little profundity. Being does not denote in the Brahmaņas the whole of existence as a unity, contrasted with the imperfect plurality of the individual; it is essentially the term to denote that whence the world emerged, and the Vedic thinker proceeds to ask whence it itself came, evolving the answers not- being or something beyond both being and not-being, identified in the usual light-hearted manner in one passage with mind." Not-being naturally as the foundation of all things is subject to similar identifications; it may be said to be the seers, or to practise austerities, or to desire to become being, mere verbal intricacies without trace of serious thought." 

Some effort, however, is made to secure order in conceptions, and there can

[Part V 

be traced the gradual formation of the ideas of the five elements and of the five senses, with mind above or beside them, ideas which introduce some degree of system into the conception of the external world and of man's powers, although terminology remains changing and vague. Persistent from the Puruṣasūkta onwards is the effort to distinguish and compare the macrocosm and the microcosm; what is interpreted as regards the gods (adhidevatam, adhidaivatam) as earth, atmosphere, and sky, is mind, breath, and speech as regards the self (adhyatmam); wind, fire, sun, the quarters, and the moon correspond to breath, speech, eye, ear, and mind. Similarly there is a marked love for arranging things in lists, each with many correspondences; if the creator produces 1 from his mouth the Trivṛt Stoma, it has as correlative the god Agni, the metre Gayatri, the Rathantara tune, the Brahman among men, the goat among beasts, and similar series are invented for the other Stomas. Correspondence in any sense is a basis for identification, and affords one of the various rounds of connexion even of the loosest nature which justified a Brahmanical identification.

More interesting is the effort to express aspects of reality by the use of the word Tanu, 'body'. It denotes primarily simply the body of a person or his self regarded as corporeal, as in the reflexive use of the term and in its occa- sional exchange with Atman, which denotes the spiritual aspect of the self. But it is specially frequent in the plural to denote what may best be styled aspects; thus Agni has one aspect as bearing the oblations to the gods, another as carrying the offerings for the dead; he has auspicious and dread aspects. The aspects may be mortal or immortal; Prajapati has five of either, mortal as hair, &c., immortal as mind, &c. Taken together they may make up the whole, or they may be set beside the self, Atman, as members; or the whole may itself be styled a Tanu.4 Or the aspects may be in different places; even the Rigveda recognizes that Agni has such aspects. In any case the Tanūs give rise to indefinite possibilities of identification, since in respect of some one or other of them most things can be made similar. 

While Tanu is not of enduring importance in Indian thought, Rūpa, 'form', remains a term of high importance. Its primary meaning is visible extension or shape; it is the object of the eye, as sound is that of the ear. Only during life does form exist, being lost in death, a hint of the doctrine of the necessity of the imposition of form on matter to create the concrete individual. Similarly the Brahman is said to enter the world when it is to be made distinct by means of name and form, the name corresponding to the form, and thus to develop the idea-being the means of expressing the nature of the form, though this conception is far from that of the Brāhmaṇa which treats name and form as two distinct active potencies. Nor can we

venture to attach too much importance to the aspect of Rūpa as form, for even in the Chandogya Upanisad 1 the term denotes not pure form, but a material possessing form; heat, water, food are the results of the creator entering the world with name and form, 

Form naturally serves as the basis of identifications, for almost anything can be said to be the form of another, either on solid or on fanciful grounds. Thus the bull can be said to be the form or symbol of Indra, type of male strength, butter and gold of the cow, repaired things of the fire piled after an fruitless effort. Or the firesticks are the hidden form of Agni, while he is the revealed form. If things have any form in common, they can be identified, and though Tanu derives its origin from the corporeal aspect of a thing, and Rupa comes from the idea of appearance, they tend largely to coincide in force. But, unlike Tanu, Rūpa is regularly associated with name, and the association develops into the expression, name and form, which in Buddhism expresses concrete individuality.

Akin to Rupa in the view of many scholars is the somewhat vague term Dhaman, especially in cases where we hear of the Dhāmāni of such a god as Soma, or, as often in the Brāhmaṇas and earlier, of the dear Dhaman of a deity, though the sense' abode' is preferred by Hillebrandt 3 among others. We hear of the butter as the dear Dhaman of Agni, of the mead as that of the AŚvins; speech is that of Indra and Agni, salt that of heaven and also of the cattle, the quarters that of Soma. A frequent reward of the man who worships correctly or has the proper knowledge is to attain the Dhaman of the deity, or by the use of the sacrificial strew, which is the Dhaman of cattle, one obtains them." In Oldenberg's view the term denotes what is ordained (dha). Thus in the Rigveda we hear of the ordinances of Mitra and Varuna, and with a genitive the term often denotes what is appointed by some power." In other cases, when thus used, the term in the genitive expresses what is ordained, or the substratum, in which the thing ordained has effect; the former may be the meaning in the Rigveda 8 of the phrase the Dhaman of the Rta, which is given as the description of the dawn, or the Dhaman of the sacrifice.10 But, while this explanation has the advantage of being true to the etymology of the term, and is doubtless largely correct, it is clear that the meaning ' abode' early developed, and this sense should probably be recognized much more freely than is admitted by Oldenberg, though he recognizes that the term did develop something approaching this sense.11

The Philosophy of the Veda 

[Part V 

It is significant that contemporaneously we find the science of grammar alone in process of development; the Brahmaņas show knowledge of the scientific grouping of the letters,1 of the distinction of case forms, numbers and so forth, and the elaboration of the system of Pāņini, as well as the researches of the PratiŚakhyas prove the skill which was being developed in this period. The Nirukta of Yaska which falls in date at the close of the Brāhmaṇa period proves how considerable had been the advances made in regard to questions of etymology, the classification of the parts of speech (of which Yāska reckons four, nouns, verb, prepositions, and particles), and the nature of language.2 The superiority of Indian achievement in this regard to that of contemporary Greece is manifest, but, on the other hand, there is extremely little evidence of any progress in regard to astronomy or mathematics, for we cannot accept the overestimates of the knowledge involved in the Śulba Sutras, apart altogether from the doubt as to their date, and the fact of their serving essentially practical ends. Of natural science we know nothing at this period, and both in the Brāhmaṇas and the Upanisads the nature of the ideas current is incompatible with any progress in these matters in contemporary thought.*
