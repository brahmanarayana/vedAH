## 01. The Origin of the Upanisads 

NATIVE tradition1 derives the term Upanisad, by means which will not bear scrutiny, from roots which yield as its sense either that which destroys innate ignorance, or that which leads to the Brahman. It is more important to note that from an early period the utmost stress is laid on the secret character of the instruction contained in these works: the rule is that they are the highest mysteries, and that their doctrines should not be imparted to any pupil, other than a son, who has not already studied with the teacher for a year and who does not intend himself to become a teacher. The same view is enforced by the facts recounted in the texts: when the deepest part of the discussions arrives, the two concerned go apart and talk of the new doctrine of action as the source of human fate. 

When, therefore, we seek for an origin of the term which will not defy the laws of etymology, it is necessary to find something which will accord with this essential nature of secrecy. The word is derived obviously from the prefixes upa-ni and sad, 'sit', and the only natural meaning is a session, a sitting down near some person, who naturally is assumed to be the teacher. This accords with the mode of teaching followed in India, which, as we have seen, involved the sitting of the pupil and the teacher facing each other, while the latter repeated the lesson to be learned by the former. The lessons of the teacher to his pupil were not public in the ordinary sense of the word: to be practicable they naturally required quiet, but the ritual texts show us more than that they bear witness that certain texts of special importance were to be taught to the pupil in the forest, and not in the normal place, the abode of the teacher. With this accords admirably the fact that the Upanisads form parts of, or are attached in the case of the most important and old of these works to, texts which tradition gives the names of Aranyaka.2 The name must clearly, as held by Oldenberg, have been derived from the fact that the discussions contained in these works were studied in the forest; the alternative view that the Aranyakas were specially intended for study by

the Vanaprasthas, men who, after serving their apprenticeship as Brahman students and having performed as householders their duties, retire to the forests to study, is clearly a more advanced conception than that obtained in the early Upaniṣads. The later view is an artificial conception, and one which grew up only with the strict division of stages of life enjoined on Brahmans, if not always observed. Naturally, however, the Aranyakas, in so far as they are texts of allegorical interpretation of the sacrifice, were studied by such Vanaprasthas more than were the Brāhmaṇas proper, which were rather ritual in their interest, and presumed that the sacrifice was actually being performed. The Aranyakas in their more distinctive portions deal with the meaning of the offering, without necessarily assuming that it will be performed: they some- times suggest modes of performing the sacrifice by meditation and repetition- as of the Hotṛ formulae only. But the distinction of Brahmana and Aranyaka is not an absolute one: in no case have we in the works handed down to us Brāhmaṇas which always suppose the performance of ritual, or Aranyakas which assume that it is not to be performed. Nor can we see why the dis- tinction, which was probably the real one between the Brāhmaṇas and the Aranyakas, the comparative sanctity of their contents, should have attached itself to precisely the ceremonies to which it did so attach itself. The ritual texts of the different Vedas show us clearly the fact that certain rites and texts were regarded as especially sacred, to be performed outside the village, and these texts are contained not merely in Aranyakas but even in the Samhita form. Thus the Pravargya rite is treated in this fashion in the Taittiriya Aranyaka iv and v, while the Mantras concerned are also to be found in the later part of the Vajasaneyi Samhita," in which they are followed by other Mantras, containing certain dread names of the Maruts and certain invocations of formidable character used in the horse sacrifice. The Aranyagana of the Samaveda and the Aranyaka Samhita contain the secret texts of that Veda, and the Aitareya and Śāñkhāyana Aranyakas 5 present the secret texts of the Rigveda, of which the most important is that concerning the Mahavrata, an old and popular rite, while the former contains also the Mahānāmni verses, 

with Oldenberg. Oltramare (L'histoire des idées théosophiques, i. 63, n. 1) suggests 'introduction' or 'initiation', hence mystic doctrine.

which appear in a form strange to the manner of the Rigveda and akin to that of the Samaveda, in which they are also found. Both texts contain also certain mystic doctrines regarding the Samhita form of the text of the Rigveda, and the Śankhāyana deals also with the Mantha. Both also include, like the Taittiriya, philosophical Upanisads. The Aitareyins and the Kauṣitakins of the Rigveda placed the Mahāvrata ceremony in the rank of a fit subject for an Aranyaka, but the Yajurveda allowed it to appear in the Samhita, and the Samaveda treats of it in the PañcavinŚa and Jaiminiya Brāhmaṇas. But we can realize how from their superior sanctity the tendency grew for these treatises to be used as the places of the record of the secret doctrines, which gradually, in the mind of the priests, took the place of the more material performance of the ritual.

As the distinction between Brāhmaṇa and Aranyaka is not an absolute one, though the Aranyakas tend to contain more advanced doctrines than the Brāhmaṇas, so the distinction between Upanisad and Aranyakas is also not absolute, tradition actually incorporating the Upanisads in some cases in the Aranyakas. The most that can be said is that the term Upanisad, when applied to a text, normally denotes that it contains speculation mainly on the nature of the universe and of the Atman or the Brahman. Its use in the Upanisad is in one or other of the senses 'secret word' or 'phrase ', 'secret text' or 'secret import'. Thus, when the phrase1 neti neti, 'not so, not so', is used as an expression of the highest unity, that is an Upanisad; or again the word jalan 2 as indicating that in which beings breathe, perish, and are born, or the phrase 3 satyasya satyam, the truth of the true', or tadvanam as the final end is so described. In the texts of the Taittiriya school in special the phrase is used at the end of a section of philosophical teaching as a descrip- tion of that teaching. Or the word is applied to a special subject of knowledge, such as the meaning of the word Om. In a slightly different way we hear of a man's Upanisad, which denotes his secret rule of life, such as that one should not beg. In these senses the term Aranyaka is never used, and thus we can perhaps see why the two different words Aranyaka and Upaniṣad came into being. The former is a name, denoting the generic character of the texts, as those which from their secret nature must be dealt with in the special manner of being studied in the forest; the latter is a secret text, imparted at such a secret session, and in course of time more and more specifically appropriated to the description of secrets which were of philosophical character. Beyond these generalisms we are hardly likely to be able to penetrate. 

Two different theories of the origin of the term have, however, been urged 

(ZII. i. 58-68), who inclines to overesti- mate the age of the verses, as of Rigvedic rank, unfortunately ignores entirely Oldenberg's work.

and require some notice. It is the view of Oldenberg 1 that the real sense of Upanisad is worship or reverence, that the word expresses the same ideas as Upasana, and that it is due to the constant practice of the text to recom- mend the adoration of the Brahman or the Atman under the guise of some symbol. There can be no doubt about the fact of the use of symbols in this way, but it is certain that the use of upa-sad as a verb in the Upaniṣads is always quite clearly distinguished from the meaning worship', and relates only to the going to a teacher, and sitting beside him for instruction: it is admitted that in this sense the normal use is upa-sad, not upa-ni-sad, but it is also plausible that the choice of the term was dictated by the fact that Upasad has in the ritual a very definite meaning of its own, which rendered the selection of a different word desirable to describe the action intended. In the second place it is clear that the idea of reverence or worship must have passed away at an early date from its original sense, and that, therefore, there is nothing to commend it on the ground of simplicity as an explanation: the Taittiriya Upanisad uses the term of the mere knowledge of the combina- tion of letters, and the sense' rule ', as in not to beg', cannot be deduced from worship' as easily as secret instruction' can be deduced from 'session', beside a teacher, as opposed to a gathering for open discussion, Pariṣad or Samsad. In the third place, though this is not at all conclusive, the Atman or the Brahman is not properly the object of reverence at all, since reverence implies the very duality which the Upanisads deny, and, if in reality the origin of the word lay in that sense, then it must be admitted that the Upanisads bear a name which their essential doctrine transcends. This of course is quite possible in itself: the other two considerations set out make it improbable.

The view of the word taken by Deussen 3 differs from that adopted above, which sees in it a natural counterpart to the term Aranyakas, and derives it from the tradition of the Vedic school teaching, in that it assumes a break in the development of the thought of India. For that view it should be observed that there is the advantage of continuity: the Brāhmaṇas shade off imper- ceptibly into the Aranyakas, the Aranyakas shade off into the Upanisads without violent change of any kind. But on the theory of Deussen we are not to adopt the view that secret import on the subjective, and secret instruction on the objective side, were the meanings developed from the secret teaching in the forest. On the contrary we are to believe that, at this point at a time when the Brahmans were still bent on the study of the ritual, the warrior class developed a new and striking philosophy, which they expressed in secret

formulae like tajjalan,1 called Upanisads, because the essence of their character was secret communications, and that these doctrines were accompanied by secret explanations, from which in the course of time arose the first Upanisads. We must, it is claimed and has been argued by Garbe 2 with great emphasis, accept the view that it was not to the Brahmans, but to the warriors, to the princes, and the nobles, and to the wisdom of kings that India owed its philosophy. 

5 

This argument rests on facts recorded in the texts themselves, in which kings appear as authorities on philosophy. In the Chandogya Upanisad five learned Brahmans desire to learn from Uddalaka Aruni the nature of the Atman VaiŚvānara: he doubts his ability to explain it, and as a result all six betake themselves to the king AŚvapati Kaikeya, who gives them instruction, after first demonstrating the inaccuracy of their knowledge. In a narrative which is preserved in the Brhadaranyaka Upanisad and in the Kauṣitaki Upanisad a scholar, Gargya Bālāki, undertakes to set out the nature of the Brahman to the king AjätaŚatru of KaŚi: he propounds twelve views-or in the Kauṣitaki sixteen-which are all defective, and the king then explains the Atman to him by the principle of deep sleep, prefacing his instruction by the observation that it is a reverse of the rule for a Brahman to betake himself to a Ksatriya for instruction. Another legend in the Chandogya 

6 shows the Brahmans being instructed in the nature of ether, as the ultimate basis of all things, by the king Pravahaṇa Jaivali. It is added that Atidhanvan once gave the same knowledge to UdaraŚãṇḍilya, and the former name might be that of a prince. Less important is the fact that the Brahman Narada is represented in the Chandogya as being the recipient of information from Sanatkumāra, later the god of war, who tells the former that all his Vedic lore is a mere name. The great text regarding the doctrine of transmigration is set out by Pravāhaṇa Jaivali to Aruni with the remark that the Brahmans have never before had this information, which so far had remained the monopoly of the Ksatriyas. In a third version of this account, given in the Kausītaki Upanisad, the king is Citra Gāñgyāyani.

Now it is always difficult to believe in the sudden evolution of new doctrines, actually associated in the name with the conception of the absolute of the Brahman class, by circles, whose duty was presumably to wield the weapons of war, and who at any rate failed to retain the control of these doctrines: it is absolutely certain that the Upanisads, as we have them, are not the work of 

in the Upanisads of the Yajurveda, the royal Veda, and this is certainly not an argument of any value.

warriors, that they were handed down by priests, and that, if the warrior class originated these doctrines, they failed to continue the interest they had shown in them.1 Stress must also be laid as against the supporters of the theory on the divergent views taken by them of the real work done by the Ksatriyas. To Garbe they appear to have revolted from the sacrifice, and to have introduced a monist philosophy, centring in the idea of the Brahman- presumably appropriated by them, with a curious sense of humour, from their rivals. The doctrine of Karman is expressly claimed as theirs, so that they must be held, while adopting a monist philosophy, to have insisted on the importance of morality. On the other hand, the Brahmans were forced to adopt this Kṣatriya view by the pressure of public opinion, which compelled them to adopt it into their own system. This, frankly, appears a very curious conception; it is remarkable that the public should insist on a philosophic monism, when we remember that throughout Indian history we find every form of worship pursued with a painful eagerness and precision, and when we remember also how little popular opinion anywhere insists on a strict monism, especially one which empties life of any reality. A further difficulty arises when we find that the Ksatriyas are credited by Garbe 2 with the creation of the Samkhya philosophy as a revolt against prevailing views; apparently one set of Ksatriyas operated against another, and, as he accepts Ksatriya doctrines as the basis of Buddhism, we find that the great schism in Indian views was that of one Ksatriya view against another. Hertel, again, who accepts the doctrine of the Ksatriya origin of the philosophy of the Upanisads, ignores the fact that the doctrine of Karman is their chief claim, and insists instead that they were rationalists who depersonalized the old gods, substituting in lieu the idea of nature powers-called by them faute de mieux, through the poverty of language of the time, deities, and whose philosophy was essentially a monism atheistic, materialistic, and morally indifferent. Judged on this basis it may be doubted if the praise lavished on the Ksatriyas at the expense of the Brahmans would have exactly been acceptable to them. 

As has been indicated, stress is naturally laid in support of the theory of Kṣatriya influence on the explicit assertion of the king that the knowledge of transmigration had never belonged to any Brahmans, but the assertion is a very odd one: the king claims that the 'giving of instruction' has been the possession of the warriors because the Brahmans have not studied this doctrine, but even for India such a thought is absurd and meaningless, and reduces the claim of the king to what, it seems, is an idle vaunt. Then again, as it is impossible to deny that the Atman-Brahman doctrine has a long pre- vious history in the Brahmanas, and is a logical development of the idea of 

1 A further complication is adduced by 

those who believe that Buddhism was promoted by Ksatriyas of Mongolian origin (V. Smith, Oxford History of India, p. 47); the precise relations of these sets of Ksatriyas does not 

appear to be explained by their supporters.

unity of the Rigveda, we must admit that the warrior class must have shared in the intellectual development, which produced that idea, and then started a fresh view-which nevertheless was based on the Brahman, not the Kṣatra- in opposition to the sacrifice, while the priests were deeply engaged in the sacrifice. But the sacrifices were essentially not matters in which the priest acted for himself: he aimed at securing the profit of his patron, and the patrons for the great sacrifices must have been in the main the very warrior class, which we are to assume turned with disgust from the sacrifice.1 The true solution of the problem is suggested by the obvious difficulties of the position of the maintainers of the theory: we must adopt a solution which explains why the whole Upanisad tradition is Brahmanical, and yet why the texts record actions of importance as regards the doctrine by the princes of earth. It is absurd to imagine that these references would have been left to stand had the Brahmans found them derogatory to their dignity: the sense of historical accuracy must have been very strong, incredibly so indeed, which would have induced a priesthood to preserve an exact account of the royal founders of each doctrine, and that they did so is sufficiently disproved by the mere fact that they clearly did not preserve a true account even of the Brahman founders of their doctrines. The prominence of Yajnavalkya can hardly be historical, since he is also the great ritual teacher of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, and the device of assuming more than one man of the same name is absurd in this as in many other cases, since the texts assume that the two are the same: nor again does any one really believe that Sanatkumāra was a human king. The explanation 2 becomes simple enough when we look at the Brahmanas and the Rigveda: there we find that kings are often mentioned as generous donors that there are lists of the great kings who performed sacrifices, and who beyond all things gave fees to the priest, just as in historical times great kings, like Puşyamitra and Samudragupta, boast of their offerings. It was clearly necessary for the priests, who abandoned the doctrine of sacrifice, to live they, therefore, had to find patrons and they must accordingly, like their predecessors, the sacrificial priests, represent their teachings as worth large sums. As a king must sacrifice to give gifts, so he must at least understand, and take part in discussions, to give gifts, and the position of the kings might casily be wholly deduced from the needs of the priest. But it would be un- necessary, and, it may be added, perhaps unjust to hold this view the thought of the Upanisads with all its demerits is a far nobler thing than the thought of the Brāhmaṇas: as later among the Buddhists, the minds which could rise from the mere sacrifice to the consideration of the self were quite capable of accepting help from other minds: of low origin, Satyakāma,

whose mother was a mere slave girl Jabālā, who ran about with men and who could not tell his father, was taken as a pupil by Haridrumata and attained the complete knowledge: 1 even the epic, in one of its juster moments, allows a learned Śudra honour and permits a merchant to instruct a Brahman." In modern India saints of the highest rank have been other than Brahmans in caste. The princes were now and then seers, like Divodāsa, son of VadhryaŚva, and they may for their part have now and then wearied of the sacrifice, and sought a higher truth, just as, inversely, we hear of seers who sought kingly rank for their offspring, and there may be that degree of accuracy in the figure played by them in the legends. But that the philo- sophy of the Brahmanas as seen in the Upanisads is essentially the develop- ment of the philosophy of the Brāhmaṇas cannot reasonably be doubted. Nor is there any ground for thinking that the philosophy had its chief home anywhere save in the holy ground of the Brahmans, the land of Kurukṣetra, which seems to have been in this period as in the earlier epoch the place of Brahmanical culture par excellence. The culture was not absolutely restricted to that area: the mention of AŚvapati Kaikeya carries us further to the north- west, while we hear of Brahmans who dwelt in Magadha,' though that was rare. The Kauṣitaki Upanisad 8 preserves for us in the movements of Gargya Bālāki the traces of the extent of the activity of the new movement: he went among the Kurus, the Pañcālas, the two folks then being joined, the KaŚis and Videhas, and the VaŚas and Matsyas, and among the UŚinaras. All this accords with the extent of the land in which the sacrifice was prevalent, and the addition of the Kosalas would complete the list: doubtless their omission here is mere chance. Other allusions to countries do not show any substantial extension of the geographical horizon of the authors: the Vindhya mountains are, it seems, known to the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, and this is perhaps a proof that the Vedic civilization was extending southwards in greater degree than in the preceding period. The references to the Indus region, whence came salt and noble horses, suggest that it was afar off, but against this is to be set the mention of Gandhara as not at all a distant country in the Chandogya Upanisad.10 But culture was not in any event rigidly confined to the middle country scholars in their wanderings penetrated as far as the Madras, on the Hyphasis.11

inhabitants, Dravidians or others. It has frequently been suggested that the philosophy of the Upanisads is essentially Dravidian rather than Aryan, and plausible grounds can be adduced in this sense.1 Thus, we may be fairly certain that, as time went on, Dravidian blood came more and more to pre- vail over Aryan, though in candour we should admit that the evidence on this head is purely speculative in the absence of any real knowledge of the Aryan physical type which entered India. In the second place the changes in language may be due to Dravidian influence; 2 here again the evidence is scanty enough, in the absence of independent evidence of the Dravidian languages for the period of the Brahmanas and Upanisads, and the difficulty of tracing to them any definite influence on the language; the use of cerebral or domal letters, and forms like the second future (kartāsmi) or perfect participle used verbally (kṛtavän), or the development of constructions with the in- declinable gerund, may have been encouraged by tendencies among the Dravidians; but this cannot be definitely established. That Rudra-Śiva is mainly aboriginal is rather a guess based on the belief that the name denotes 'red' than an ascertained fact, and we have no assurance on the strength of which we could claim that the use of trance and asceticism or caste were Dravidian elements appropriated by the Aryans. The pantheism of the Upanisads may be deemed to be a philosophical development from the animistic views which Jainism and in a sense Buddhism presents, and which may be contrasted with the anthropomorphic nature gods of the Aryans, and a contrast may be drawn between Iranian religion and Indian, suggesting that the former presents us a picture of the practical Aryan mind as opposed to the more mystic Indian intelligence. These contentions, we may admit, do not lead to any assured results in the sense of establishing the Dravidian 4 claim. What they indicate is the unquestionable fact that the Upanisads, as in some degree all earlier thought in India, represent the outcome of the reflections of a people whose blood was mixed. We may, if we desire, call the Upanisads the product of Aryo-Dravidian thought; but, if we do so, we must remember that the effect of the intermixture must be regarded in the light of chemical fusion, in which both elements are transformed.

rehandled, and the names to which they are ascribed cannot be taken au pied de la lettre as in the case of Yajnavalkya, we cannot assume that they really prove or indicate activity in philosophical research on the part of the men who are mentioned. It is also important to note that the texts, such as they are, are, in the case of the more important at any rate, not the productions of a single hand they are redactions, perhaps made at more than one time,1 of varying philosophic arguments, and they therefore contain very various doctrines, which are not often consistent. 

6 

It is perfectly possible to arrive at a rough estimate of the relative periods of the Upanisads. The first place must probably be accorded to the Aitareya Aranyaka in its philosophic portion, that is the first three sections of the second book, and probably the Aitareya Upanisad, which fills the remaining three sections of the second book, is not to be dated later than any of the other Upanisads: the only evidence of later date alleged by Deussen in the case of the Upanisad cannot be taken as sufficient to prove his view. After these works must certainly come the Bṛhadaranyaka Upaniṣad in its main portion, books i-iv, and the Chandogya Upanisad. The Chandogya is in almost every case, as far as one can judge, secondary in its versions of matter which it shares with the Bṛhadaranyaka Upanisad. But at any rate it is certain that the Taittiriya Upanisad, which forms books vii-ix of the Taitti- rīya Aranyaka, is later than the two last-mentioned: it exhibits the doctrine of five as opposed to three elements,5 and that in a way which renders the simple view that the distinction is unimportant most improbable. This is a matter of real consequence in the progress of thought, and the argument is of quite different weight than that derived by Deussen from the fact that the Aitareya Upanisad' knows of four classes of living beings to three of the Chandogya : the classification is merely mentioned en passant, and is of no moment in other Upaniṣads. The Kauṣitaki is much later than the others, except the Taittiriya, but is probably earlier than it. Its version of transmi- gration is a new edition of that in the two great Upanisads, the Bṛhadaranyaka 10 and the Chandogya,11 and its account 12 of Gargya is a more developed one than 1 BAU. consists of three parts (i-ii, iii-iv, v-vi); ii. 4 is repeated in a secondary form in iv. 5.

that in the Bṛhadaraṇyaka,1 while in another section 2 it is clearly later than the Aitareya. Finally the Kena, which is in part metrical and is in itself a part of much longer Upanisad, the Jaiminiya Upanisad Brāhmaṇa, is no doubt to be ranked as the last of the older Upanisads. The Jaiminiya Upanisad Brāhmaṇa itself is of the nature of an Aranyaka rather than a mere Upanisad that it does not bear the title Aranyaka is perhaps an idiosyncrasy of the Saman schools, none of which actually call any text of theirs an Aranyaka. As an Aranyaka it has no claim to any very early date: it seems in fact to be certainly later than the Aitareya. The Taittiriya Aranyaka, on the other hand, apart from the Upanisad section (vii-ix and x), is of most miscellaneous content and various date. The Bṛhadaranyaka Upanisad forms part of the last book of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa," and the title shows the close relation of Aranyaka and Upanisad. In the case of the Chandogya, the first two sections of the work are of the Aranyaka type, but as with texts attached to the Samaveda generally do not bear that name. The Kauşitaki, like the Aitareya, is part of a longer Aranyaka.“ 

7 

The next group of Upanisads is marked by the fact that it is composed of texts in metre, with very slight exceptions. It contains the Katha, the IŚa, the CvetaŚvatara, Mundaka and Mahānārāyaṇa, that is the last book (x) of the Taittiriya Aranyaka. The texts are distinguished from the previous group, not merely by their form, but by their contents. The old discussions with their tentative and confused efforts to reach definite results are replaced by a definite phraseology, in which the results of speculation have been summed up in brief dogmas, expressed often with an obvious desire for the paradoxical and the bizarre. The allegories, not rarely found in the Upanisads of the older class, which share them with the Aranyakas, disappear altogether. More marked still is the relation of the texts to the other collections: the Katha bears the name of a famous school of the Black Yajurveda whose Samhita is still preserved for us, but its nature is that it is really a rewriting, from a philosophical as opposed to a ritual point of view, of the story, found in the Taittiriya Brahmaṇa, of Naciketas and the winning of boons from Death by him. The Mahānārāyaṇa is reckoned in some authorities as the tenth book of the Aranyaka of the Taittiriya school, but the Aranyaka is a body of very various and confused contents, and between it and the Upanisad there is no inherent connexion at all, such as always exists in the previous group. Similarly the IŚa Upanisad has succeeded in obtaining entry as a book (x1) of the Vajasaneyi Samhita, with which it has nothing really to do, and which

has been much added to in the course of time, parts of its contents in books xxxi, xxxii, and xxxiv1 belonging in conception to the period of the Brah- manas. The CvetaŚvatara and the Mundaka have not even a nominal effective connexion with any extant text, beyond the fact that the Mundaka uses the Atharvaveda (x. 7), and we need not suppose that they ever had any such connexion. 

2 

In this group it is quite clear that the Katha takes the first rank its style is suggested already by the metrical part of the Kena and by verses found in the Bṛhadaranyaka in a later addition. The IŚa is clearly dependent on the Katha, and the CvetaŚvatara is certainly well aware of the Katha, and is probably a good deal later even than the IŚa, which is free from the sectarian spirit of the CvetaŚvatara in which the philosophy leads up to the glorifica- tion of Rudra as the god par excellence. The Mundaka uses apparently the ŚvetaŚvatara, and it again is probably presumed by the Mahānārāyaṇa." 

5 

The last group of important Upanisads consists of the PraŚna, the Maitra- yaniya, and the Mandukya. They are in prose, but they differ essentially in every respect from the older prose Upanisads: the diction is in style much more elaborate than the early prose, and in the case of the Maitrāyaṇiya, which Max Müller wrongly believed early in date, the language is obviously closely allied to classical Sanskrit, which it follows in the introduction of greater development and complexity of style. The order of the Upanisads in this group is certain as regards the PraŚna and Maitrayaniya," and pro- bable as regards the Maṇḍūkya.8 In philosophy they show their wide know- ledge of the earlier texts, which they freely use. The PraŚna is proved to be later than the Mundaka by the fact that it presupposes it and quotes it." 

With these the list of important Upanisads closes: but the manufacture of these works went on indefinitely down even to modern times. The later Upanisads claimed connexion with the Atharvaveda, and it is probable that the Mundaka and the PraŚna were really so connected: the others had no real bond of union, but were pleased to assume one for their own purposes. These Upanisads fall into four classes, according as they (1) merely develop doctrines already found in the older Upanisads; or (2) devote themselves to

the glorification of the Yoga practices, by which religious ecstasy was pro- duced; or (8) deal with the condition of the Sannyasin; or (4) finally give themselves up to the glorification of Rudra-Śiva. 

The history of the text of the Upanisads is of interest, but not of impor- tance for philosophy: the Atharvan Upaniṣads seem the first to have been collected into one set: we know of collections 1 of 34 or 52,2 in which case others from the older type were added. A later collection, which arose in South India, has 108 Upanisads, including all the great Upaniṣads of the older type. A collection of 50 Upanisads was made at some unknown date and was translated into Persian in 1656 for Dara Shukoh: a literal Latin translation from the Persian made by Anquetil du Perron in 1801-2 was the means of bringing the Upanisads to the notice of Schopenhauer, and winning for them that place in the history of philosophy which they have never lost. The collec- tion includes in 12 Upaniṣads the older texts, 26 Atharvan Upaniṣads and 8 others, and makes up the total by adding four chapters of the Vājasaneyi Samhita. Of the dates of the making of these collections we have no proof: it is, however, possible that by the time of Śankara (9th cent. A.D.) the PraŚna and Mundaka were already studied together. It is certain that he made use of all the Upaniṣads included in the three great groups, save the Maitrāyaṇiya and the Maṇḍūkya, which he perhaps did not regard as an Upanisad at all. To him also are ascribed, though with doubtful justice in all cases, commentaries on these Upanisads, except the Kausitaki and the Maitrāyaṇīya, and also a commentary on the Māṇḍūkya, which however is probably the work of a different Śankara.5 The Upanisads used by Rāmānuja include all those of the great groups, save the Māṇḍūkya (though the Kārikā of Gauḍapada is cited), the Subāla and Culikā, and once even the Garbha, Jābāla, and Maha. The Jābāla and Paiñgi as well as the Kārikā are mentioned by Śankara. 

The question of absolute dates for the Upanisads is one far more difficult than that of the relative order of the texts, and admits of no decisive solution. The one argument of weight is the fact, really undeniable, that the doctrines of the Upanisads are presupposed by the doctrine of the Buddha, and that, accordingly, if we accept the view that the opinions of the Buddha can be gathered with approximate accuracy from the older texts of the Pāli Canon, it is probable that the older Upanisads are, substantially at least, older than say 500 B.C. The argument is not by any means perfect: it may be criticized

on the ground that even now the date of the Buddha is only established by very conjectural means, and still more so by the fact that the date of the Buddhist Canon rests on mere tradition, which is demonstrably in many respects defective, so that the frequently repeated assertion that the Nikayas represent approximately a period shortly after the death of the Buddha is wholly unproved and almost certainly quite untrue. A more serious argument is afforded by the really antique character of the metre of the metrical Upanisads, such as the Katha, Kena, and IŚã, but here again no absolute date is arrived at, since the only standard of comparison is either the epic, which is of very uncertain date and being not in pari materia not an absolutely safe criterion, or Pāli texts, which, apart from their own uncertainty of date, are written in a different speech, and, therefore, certainly not cogently to be adduced as evidence.2 Perhaps more secure is comparison with the metre of the Bṛhaddevata, which is with much plausibility assigned to the fourth century B.C., and this certainly suggests that the metre of these texts is older.

6 

More positive evidence cannot be found: the view that the Katha Upanisad is older than Buddhism, because the legend resembles in some degree the legend of the Buddhist Māra, ignores the fact that the story is already found in the Taittiriya Brāhmaṇa. The suggestion of Walleser 5 that in the Tevijja Sutta we are to find a reference to the Aitareya, Chandogya, and Taittiriya Upaniṣads is quite impossible, and the definite use of any particular Upanisad by any Buddhist Sutta has still to be proved. The similarity of the language of the early Upaniṣads to that of Panini is decidedly against a very early dating. Certainly it is wholly impossible to make out any case for dating the oldest even of the extant Upanisads beyond the sixth century B.C., and the acceptance of an earlier date must rest merely on individual fancy. 

In the case of the later Upanisads any dating must be still more vague. Hopkins indeed suggests the fourth century for such works as the Katha, Maitrāyaṇīya, and the CvetaŚvatara, but this appears to be as regards the Maitrāyaṇīya much too early a date: style and content alike suggest that this is one of the most recent of the important Upanisads. In the case of the CvetaŚvatara, the date selected by Hopkins appears high in view of the fact

that he is convinced that this Upanisad is later than the orthodox atheistic Samkhya, and than the theistic Samkhya-Yoga, and marks the appearance of the illusion doctrine foreign to the early Upanisads. But this view of his can hardly be accepted for reasons which will later be given, and there is, accordingly, no strong objection to the suggested date beyond the fact that there is no cogent evidence for it. A very different view of the date of the ŚvetaŚvatara, the Mundaka, and the Māṇḍūkya Upanisads is suggested by Walleser,1 who holds that the illusion theory is posterior to, and derived from, the nihilistic school of Buddhist thought, and that in particular the Maṇḍūkya is not necessarily anterior to the Kārikā of Gauḍapāda-taken by him as a designation of a Bengal school, not of an individual-which expounds the illusionist form of Vedanta for the first time, and which was in being by A.D. 550, but not necessarily very much earlier. This view, however, is with- out any sound foundation, and of these Upanisads no assured date can even be suggested. 

3 

The investigation of J. Hertel 2 as to the age of the Mundaka Upanisad yields little that is positive. Its comparatively late date is assured, apart from its imitations of the Katha among others, by the fact that it mentions for the first time, except perhaps for the Taittiriya Aranyaka, the seven worlds by name, that it has a list of Vedic sciences which includes the six Vedāngas, though that term is not used, and the Atharvaveda by that title, and uses the term Vedanta of the doctrine of the Upanisads. It knows in all probability the personal Brahman.5 In certain points Hertel indicates similarities with Jain views; thus, as the title indicates, the work seems to belong to an Athar- vavedin sect which practised the habit of shaving the head or pulling out the hair, a Jain practice. The Purusa in the Upanisad is described by comparing his various members to the fire and other cosmic powers; the Jains, unlike Buddhists and Brahmans, are wont to represent the universe in human shape in their cosmographical fancies. The Upanisad approves asceticism, as does Jainism, and treats release as attained by one who has gained the Brah- maloka, and it is from that world that the man who is freed' attains his final abode in the Jain system, and a parallel can be drawn between the terms in

which the Upanisad and the Jain texts describe the ascent. Certain of the terms of the Upanisad have Jain currency (cyu, nirveda, rāga, vītarāga, samyag- jñāna, granthi). It is, however, clear that in all these cases there is no reason to assume Jain priority. Nor do metrical tests do more than show what is other- wise certain, the priority of the Katha.1 Grammatical forms of pronounced inaccuracy suggest careless composition rather than assure any definite date. 

2 

Another possible source of evidence is the date of IŚvarakṛṣṇa, the author of the Saṁkhya Kārikā. It is perfectly clear that the Samkhya system was substantially older than he in its substance and even in detail, so that a considerable age must be assumed for it, if IŚvarakṛṣṇa is to be assigned to the first century A.D. or even the first half of the second century A.D. Unfortu- nately the evidence as to IŚvarakṛṣṇa is by no means satisfactory. It seems, however, clear that he was either an older contemporary, if he is identified with Vindhyavāsa, of Vasubandhu, or still older, but this clearly, accepting the earlier date of Vasubandhu, which terminates his existence about A.D. 350. does not lead us further back than about A.D. 300, or half a century earlier." A further argument, however, has been adduced by S. K. Belvalkar, who holds that the commentary on the Kārikā, which was rendered into Chinese by Paramartha about A.D. 560, was the work of Maṭhara, and is to be dated about A.D. 400. Now as the Maṭhara-Vṛtti frequently calls IŚvarakṛṣṇa Bhagavant, a term which would not readily be applied to a recent author, we may assume the date of the first century A.D. or shortly after for IŚvarakṛṣṇa. 

Unfortunately the evidence for these conclusions is peculiarly unsatis- factory. The work for which the title of Mathara-Vṛtti is claimed bears this title on the strength of a single colophon only in a MS. apparently of A. D. 1400, which is a very slender piece of evidence. The careful analysis of Belvalkar himself shows that it contains up to 3 per cent. of what he regards as con- taminations with Gauḍapada, and 20 per cent. of students' additions, includ- ing a reference to the Hastamalaka attributed to Śankara, while it gives apparently an extra Kārikā, which certainly has no real claim to be original. In these circumstances, instead of claiming that we have the Maṭhara- Vṛtti established as the source of Paramartha and Gauḍapada, the natural conclusion seems to be that this is a compilation derived from the original commentary, now lost, to which the style of Maṭhara-Vṛtti has been given without authority in the lighthearted manner of scribes and owners of MSS. Practically fatal to the theory of Maṭhara as the author of the original com-

ment is the fact that the translator nowhere gives or hints at this name, which is also ignored by Gauḍapada. What we really do know of an early Mathara is that Jain texts 1 which refer to the Satthitanta add to it the Madhara, which means probably that Maṭhara wrote on the Sastitantra, with which agrees precisely the assertion of Gunaratna Sūri in his commentary on the SaddarŚanasamuccaya that Maṭhara's Bhāṣya was Şaşṭitantroddhara- rupa. Otherwise, the silence regarding Mäṭhara as a commentator of the Kārikā is complete. We are, therefore, left without any evidence of the real authorship of the original commentary, which, if not by IŚvarakṛṣṇa himself, need not go back earlier than A.D. 500. 

Mention should perhaps be made of the argument deduced by Jacobi 2 from the Kauțiliya ArthaŚãstra from which he infers that the Samkhya and Yoga systems were in existence as well as the Purva Mimänsä and the materialist system of the Lokayata by the fourth century B.C. Unhappily the evidence adduced for this is not satisfactory, as the date of the ArthaŚãstra must probably 3 be placed some centuries after the date of the minister of Candragupta under whose name it passes. 

From a literary point of view the Upanisads command interest by their introduction of new forms. The dialogue appears beside the simpler dogmatic exposition of the Brahmanas, expanded and developed from the brief dis- cussions in this form of ritual problems which the Brahmaņas occasionally present. The individual character of the new teaching, which was a mystery, naturally furthered this mode of treatment, and dialogues are recorded between very strange interlocutors as well as between teacher and pupil. Interesting is the fact of competitions in which the speakers contend against one another, in order to win favour and the prize offered by a rich prince. Or two Brahmans are enjoying the meal offered by admirers; one comes to them and wins food by setting a clever riddle. A son returns to his father to report that he has been questioned, and has found himself unable to return a reply; his father assures him that he has told him all he knows, and goes with him to seek instruction. The wise can be induced by strange causes to give of their wisdom. The geese sing the praises of Raikva; he is found under a cart, scratching himself; offers of cows he haughtily refuses, but, when JanaŚruti presents his daughter, he taunts him with not realizing that this was the boon with which he should have sought his favour.4 Janaka of Videha is the king who appears as the greatest of patrons, and Yājñavalkya the wisest of Brahmans; in one contest of wits alone he vanquishes nine opponents;

the head of the last, Śakalya, splits open as the result of his failure, while robbers steal his bones.1 Women are not excluded from contests, a maiden seized by a Gandharva or even one of Yajnavalkya's wives shows herself an adept in these questions. The gods appear; Prajapati instructs the intelli- gent pupil Indra and the stupid demon Virocana." Animals lend their quota of tuition; the pupil, who watches his master's kine increase, receives instruction from the bull of the herd, from the fire, from a gander, and from a Madgu bird.3 It would, of course, be rash to trust to the historicity of the dialogues; they are attached readily to famous names, as in the Katha Naciketas and Yama carry on a dialogue in the later form of verse. 

There is, of course, much that contrasts strangely with the Platonic dialogue. An element of grave risk enters into such discussions, as we have seen in the case of the rivals of Yajñavalkya; to hold a wrong view often involves risk of death in an age when the curse is believed to have power to work its own end. Again of real dialectic there is hardly any; the inquirer is ignorant and makes wrong guesses, the teacher dogmatically expounds the truth, with little or no leading up to it, and with still less reasoning for its support; curiously enough, it is in the discussions between Indra and Praja- pati that we find more of the expression of uncertainty leading to a final illumination than usual. There are, however, especially in the dialogues of Yajnavalkya, signs of planning; the outcome is attained by a process of rejection of inferior views, arranged in something like a series of lower to higher.6

No serious advance in logic is made over the Brahmanas, though faint traces of induction by simple enumeration may be traced." On the other hand, there is a certain gain in literary form; the description of the unity of the universe produces passages of much higher feeling than was possible when dealing with the sacrifice, and distinct power is shown in the invention of such designations of the Atman as 'Not so, not so,' which excludes all particularization, while the phrase That thou art' not unworthily sums up the mystery of the identity of the self and the universe. In other cases we have empty mysticism as in the unintelligible jalan or tadvanam 10 as expressions of the absolute. One distinctive feature of value is the use of similes, often of complexity and interest; they are treated as conclusive arguments, though often only fanciful analogies, and though as always, if these are pressed, they tend to confuse the precise meaning of the text, and have afforded cause for doubt both to ancient and to modern interpreters."

inherited from the sacrificial tradition, are curiously rare, though not unknown, and in the carlier Upanisads the employment of verse is restricted, though it occurs here and there in the Bṛhadaranyaka and the Chandogya. Inter- esting as presaging the manner of the Pāli texts is the constant repetition of the same idea in slightly different forms; thus whatever is said of one sense is normally repeated verbatim, with only the essential changes, for another; the generic terms which would have spared the tedium have not yet been invented or even felt to be necessary and appropriate.1 

## 03. The Interpretation of the Upanisads 

It was attempted by the great philosopher Śankara to find in the Upani- şads the expression of a single simple doctrine, carried out consistently through all, and in his commentary on the Vedanta as set out in the Brahma Sūtra of Badarāyaṇa it is his object to interpret that Sutra and to bring out at the same time the doctrines of the Upanisṣads, the whole forming a great system of philosophy in which no contradictions should exist. The plan adopted by the philosopher for this purpose was simple: he found in the Upanisads the principle that knowledge was of two kinds, wholly different. On the one hand the higher knowledge recognized the existence of absolutely nothing save the Brahman or the Atman, the one unity, which was at once real, thought, and bliss. The force of these terms must be understood in a special sense reality is not something outside the Brahman: no predication is possible of the Brahman, for predication involves diversity and in the Brahman there is no diversity. Thought or consciousness, which is not an attribute of, but the essence of the Brahman, does not mean actual activity, the vous voyoews of Aristotle on the most probable view of that famous doctrine: it is consciousness without any object or subject, and therefore differs so entirely from the very nature of consciousness as not in our view to deserve the name at all. The bliss also is that of being which has no con- sciousness of any kind and no feeling, and therefore is merely a metaphorical expression. This single thing is all that the world really is, the one Brahman which is the Atman. All the multiplicity of phenomena is unreal: the saving truth which redeems the individual from the constant stream of births is the recognition of this fact, that he himself is really the one Atman, not related as part to it, but solely and absolutely it. In the expression That thou art"," which is enunciated in the Upanisads, is set out the fundamental fact of all existence, the indivisible unity.

The Philosophy of the Veda 

[Part V 

The apparent multiplicity of the universe and the empirical knowledge of man is not in the view of Śankara to be denied for a moment. Śankara wages war both against the idealistic school of Buddhism, which denies that there is any real distinction between dreams and waking reality, and the nihilistic school, which asserts that all is mere void. Existence is not momentary at all: it has a substantiality and is real, but only from the point of view of the lower knowledge.1 The Atman in itself has allied with it a power, Māyā, illusion, which limits it: the limitation is not indeed real, for that would hopelessly violate the essential doctrine of Śankara which denies any dualism whatever; but from the point of view of the lower knowledge that illusion exists, and through that illusion exists all that there is in the universe as known to us. Thus, there is room for a great god, the Hiranya- garbha of the Veda, who occupies the position of a demiourgos, inasmuch as he is the Atman, when it is obscured by illusion, and there is afforded an explanation for the seeming multiplicity of souls, for the unending stream of life, for the world of living creatures and inanimate nature. All indeed is an illusion, but it has within that fundamental fact all the appearance of reality.2

It will be seen at once that in this doctrine Śankara has a powerful weapon, with which to explain the whole of the system of the Upanisads as the product of a single philosophical impulse. Nevertheless, the attempt is undoubtedly merely a clever tour de force without final validity, and its ingenuity is as great but no greater than its improbability. That this is the case could be easily proved by the examination of the Upanisads in detail, but it is sufficient to state that the Brahma Sutra itself did not take the view adopted by Śañkara : it is now certain, thanks to the efforts of Thibaut, Sukhtankar, and Jacobi," among others, that the real view taken by Badarāyaṇa was more akin to, though not identical with, that taken by the commentary of Ramanuja," whose work dates some two centuries after Śankara. The view of that scholar was that the explanation of the world and of the individual souls as mere products of illusion, enveloping the nature of the Brahman, was wholly wrong on the contrary the two elements, the world and the indivi- dual souls, had a definite entity of their own, which was perfectly real, even if they were only parts of, and, therefore, much inferior in order of rank to, the Brahman, who is conceived no longer as merc impersonality but as per- sonal being. The views of Rāmānuja are in many points difficult to formulate

The Interpretation of the Upanisads

with precision: there is vagueness regarding the position of the individual soul, the world and the divinity, which is probably unavoidable, but certainly undeniable. But at any rate the system of pure idealism of the most abstract kind, which Śankara put forward, is confronted with a system which is pantheistic, for the individual souls and the world are in some sense part of the deity, but which has also a strong theistic element in the fact that the indi- vidual souls, even when they become free from transmigration through the influence of their devotion to the lord and his compassion for them, are deemed still to retain a separate existence and not to be merged in the deity. As in the case of all Indian thinkers, the tendency of Ramanuja is to be hazy regarding the nature of the deity, and the part played in that nature by consciousness, which, as we have seen, for Śañkara disappears into a meaningless abstraction, but the individual soul seems, contrary to the clear tendency of the Upanisads, and of the epic Samkhya-Yoga,1 to retain in its final form of existence some kind of consciousness which is consistent with its enjoyment of the most perfect bliss. 

Rāmānuja quotes the Upanisads as agreeing with his doctrine, but he has not made any such determined and deliberate effort to bring the Upanisads into one definite scheme as has Śañkara: he relies rather on the Sutra than on the Upanisads, but still he offers an alternative view which suits admirably many of the Upanisad passages, which he cites. He has, of course, the obvious advantage that the distinction of two kinds of knowledge is one which is artificial, and which has no direct sanction from the Upanisads themselves, so that Śankara is forced in effect to postulate a distinction of knowledge, which is not asserted in his sources. 

3 

Of modern interpreters of the Upanisads, the most important, Deussen,2 as before him Gough also, has endeavoured to show that the view of Śankara is the best key to the secrets of the Upanisads: Deussen insists that in his view, which is that of the Yajnavalkya of the Bṛhadaranyaka Upanisad, Śankara formulates the essential doctrine of the distinction between the empirical reality and the thing in itself, which was first made perfectly distinct by Kant, and which reaches its complement in the Christian and Schopen- hauerian doctrine of the primacy of the will over the intellect. Deussen holds that this form of idealism is the main doctrine of the Upanisads in the sense that it was definitely formulated and laid down, and that other doctrines are really deviations from it, caused by the inability of man to remain on the high level of thought postulated in the distinction, and by the constant effort to apply empirical categories to the thing in itself. From the tendency to regard 

1 This doctrine is definitely pantheistic; the Brahman realizes itself in the individual selves through the operation of Buddhi, 'intellect', and Ahaṁkāra, the prin- ciple of individuation, and recognition of the unity of the individual and the Brahman is the release aimed at; sec 

Dahlmann, Nirvana and Die Samkhya- Philosophie, who contends that this is the primitive Samkhya as a logical (anvikṣikt) science of the Brahman; see below, § 7. Phil. of Up., pp. 39 ff. Philosophy of the Upanishads.

The Philosophy of the Veda 

[Part V 

the universe, however, as actually real and an absolute thing, there grows up the view that the Atman is the universe which we know, that is a system of pantheism. Even Yajnavalkya, like Parmenides in Greece,1 could not resist this tendency, and falls into the error when he describes the Atman as the internal ruler, or as supporting the sun and moon, heaven and earth, and the whole universe, or as expanding into the whole external universe. But this standpoint was also liable to difficulties: the identity was difficult to hold fast, and gave way to the simpler empirical conception of causality: the Atman produces the universe, and he enters into it with his self, an idea which of course had abundant parallels in the Brāhmaṇas, when applied to personal deities such as Prajapati. This doctrine is found, he thinks, nowhere in the Bṛhadaranyaka, but in the Chandogya, the Taittiriya, the Aitareya, and later. The Atman, however, still remains the same in the world as in itself: it does not create other spirits, but enters in as itself. The pantheism thus passes into cosmogonism, and from this point of view or from the former can be explained the insistence on the identity of the spirit in the heart with the infinitely great outside. The next stage of thought pro- duces theism: the relation of the Atman to the soul in man is conceived as no longer one of identity, but as one of some degree of contrast and independence: the Atman of the individual is set over against the Atman in its highest aspect, tentatively even in some old passages, then definitely and openly in the Katha Upanisad, and still more markedly with the presentation of the Atman as the god Rudra in the CvetäŚvatara Upanisad. The road was now open for the disappearance of the deity, since the individual souls were now indepen- dent entities, and could explain the universe if taken in conjunction with the principle of the world other than souls, Prakṛti, the primeval nature. The idea of god, therefore, disappears in the Samkhya faith, and later the Yoga, which in deference to the demands of the popular movement of the day asked for a god, introduces the divinity ab extra with an obvious inconsequence, which makes him of no real importance in the philosophy of the theory. 

This is a brilliant and attractive theory, and it, of course, affords a far more rational ground for the historical comprehension of the Upanisads than does that of Śankara with its contrast of the two kinds of knowledge, and its wholly incredible suggestion2 that the authors of the views found in the Upanisads really were making this distinction between the higher and the lower forms of knowledge, when it is plain to the reader that they are simply doing their best to express their philosophic beliefs for what they were worth. Nevertheless, the idea that the different stages of view are related in the form given by Deussen is one impossible to accept: the obvious history of the Upanisads, if we are not led astray by the belief in the opening up of new 

1 What was Parmenides' real view in the second part of his poem is doubtful in the extreme, and Deussen's assertion is far from being certainly correct.

ideas by the warrior class, would suggest that the cosmogonic is the oldest form of the doctrine of the Brahman or Atman. The Vedic cosmogonism is the natural standpoint: we have there the first principle, the first creation or emanation of that principle, and the entry of that principle into the creation. The tendency of the Veda is throughout to treat creation, not as something which is developed by the mere will of the creator, but as something lying in his nature ab initio creation is rather development than the bringing into being of something hitherto not existing in any way. Hence the way is paved for the doctrine of identity in the Atman:1 the principle is manifested in the whole world, as in the myth Puruşa by his sacrifice becomes the whole world, and the further step of identifying the spiritual principle in each man with the spiritual principle which is the prius of the world, is an obvious and easy one. The pantheism of the Brahmaņas is thus inseparably connected with their cosmogonism: it would be unwise to seek to establish for the Upanisads any real distinction between these ideas. 

The tendency of the Brahmaṇas is certainly to diminish the personal aspect of the deity, but the influence of the popular religion must be borne in mind, as explaining the nature of the development of the philosophy of the Upani- sads. The worship of Rudra was, it is perfectly clear from the Brahmaṇas themselves, a very important thing indeed for the Brahmans and the people alike, and the inevitable tendency of this vivid belief in powerful and real gods, not an abstraction, was to make the character of the universal change. Praja- pati had been in some measure a god of the ritual: his name helped to make him more than mere priestly fiction, but he could not be expected to have that vivid nature, which is the characteristic of the form of Rudra. The effect of this personal adoration of great gods with the sense of dependence on them and trust in them, which is a real element in the religion of India,2 shows itself in philosophy in the theism which begins to be clearly marked in the Kaṭha Upanisad and which is expressed in the doctrine of predestination there enunciated, in the form that the saving knowledge is not a matter of learning, but is revealed to the fortunate man by the highest power itself. It is only a step hence to the sectarianism of the CvetaŚvatara Upanisad, a work which has often wrongly been deemed of much more modern date than it really is, because of the belief that the spirit of devotion to god was a product of the introduction of Christian influences. The theism of the Upanisads is, then, we may believe, a later stage than their pantheism and cosmogonism, and is due to the influence of the personal element in the religion of the priest and Brahmans alike. 

tinuity of the Vedic tradition; the philosophic hymns of the AV. have relations with the Upanisads. 

1 Hopkins (JAOS. xxii. 380, 381) insists that Atmanism without illusion is the essential side of the Upanisads and that illusion is late, but this again is over- straining the position to some slight 

extent at least.

The Philosophy of the Veda 

[Part V 

There is, however, undoubtedly another side of the absolute, which must be set off against the theistic development which in the time of Rāmānuja was used to place on a philosophic basis the worship of Vişņu, as in the CvetaŚvatara Upanisad it had been made the base of the worship of Rudra. We know of its existence from two independent sources of the highest value, the Buddhist and the Samkhya systems of philosophy, which reveal to us such despair of and disbelief in the one Atman and the absolute as to present us with nothing but individual souls in the Samkhya, and even to deny, though in a foolish and superficial way, the existence of souls in the Buddhist faith. It is certainly not easy to see how the pantheism and cosmogonism or the theism of the Upanisads could have produced this outlook on the world, and it suggests that there must have been in existence a view of the Atman as absolute which emptied it of much significance, and made it therefore tempting for those, who desired to rise superior to the mere fictions of the popular religion, to find true reality in something nearer hand, the existence of the individual and of the external universe. The theory which postulated an Atman of no real content was indeed to be found, and that was the theory of Yajnavalkya. It is true that the teaching in question is not consistently carried out, as Deussen admits, but it is plain that it lays stress on the three propositions that (1) the Atman is the knowing self, is the subject of cognition; (2) that as such it can never be an object of knowledge of any sort; and (8) that beyond the Atman there is no reality at all, as it is the sole reality. These propositions form the basis of the views of Śañkara, and it would be a com- plete error to suppose that the position of Śankara was really due1 to the effect of the teaching of the nihilist and idealist schools of Buddhism, the Madhya- mikas and the Vijñānavādins. That Śañkara was deeply influenced by their doctrines is doubtless true enough, but at the same time it seems beyond doubt that the doctrine which he maintained was originally the property of a school of Aupaniṣadas, and that, therefore, it was descended from an inter- pretation of the Upanisads, whose accuracy is confirmed by the actual texts of the Upanisads in so far as they bear out the meaning of Yajnavalkya's own doctrine: the distinction of the two forms of knowledge, and the effort to show that other views in the Upanisads can be reconciled with Yajnavalkya's on this basis, are of course the work of the predecessors of Śankara. 

The view of Yajnavalkya cannot, save by paradox, be deemed the earliest view or the dominating view expressed in the Upanisads: it must be taken as one view of considerable importance, which has received expression in portions of two of the oldest Upanisads, the Bṛhadaranyaka and the Chand- ogya, but most of all in the first. Independent and older are the cosmogonic and pantheistic views which appear in the Aitareya Aranyaka and in the 

As held by Ganganatha Jha, Khanda- nakhanḍakhadya, i. p. xii; cf. Keith, JRAS. 1916, pp. 879-81. The same view appears in Walleser, Der ältere Vedanta (1910), but it is incredible that,

as he held, it is really first in Gauda- pada's Kārikā on the Mandukya Upa- niṣad that the real Vedanta appears. Keith, Aitareya Aranyaka, pp. 41 ff.;

Brāhmaṇas, and the dominating influence of the view of Yajnavalkya ascribed to it by Deussen cannot be established. Its interest for us is not lessened by that fact it is the most characteristically individual of the doctrines of the Upanisads, and in some ways of the greatest philosophic value. It is, more- over, the chief matter in which an advance on the views of the Brāhmaṇas can be recognized. 

If we are to seek a more plausible theory of stages of development, we may assume that the fundamental question of finding a unity in the world was attacked from two points of view, already foreshadowed in the Brahmanas. On the one hand the conception of the Brahman was developed to include the whole of the universe; the holy power which controls things becomes expanded in idea into that which contains and accounts for all. On the other hand the psychic element is also developed, in part doubtless through the study of the stages of the spirit in waking and sleep; the unity here is imagined first as breath, Präņa, then it becomes conceived as intellect, Prajñā, and finally in the more abstract form of the self, Atman, a term which has the advantage of including the conception of breath, and also of intelligence, while transcending both. A decisive advance occurs when, in lieu of inade- quate efforts to express the nature of the Brahman, we have the pregnant assertion of the identity of the individual Atman with the Brahman regarded as a cosmic Atman. But this assertion leaves us with unsolved difficulties; on the one hand it leads to suggestions such as those implied or made by Yajnavalkya which indicate the illusory character of the world of appearances, asserting the unity of Atman, broken in life by the duality induced by indi- viduality, which is merged temporarily in deep sleep, finally in death; on the other we have efforts, as in the Katha, to accept as real, and deduce from the Brahman, the whole of the spiritual and non-spiritual world, efforts which lead to antinomies regarding the relation of the absolute and individual souls and end in the abolition of the absolute in the Samkhya, and of both absolute and individual in Buddhism. 

## 04. The Problem and Conditions of Knowledge 

It is an essential feature of the Upanisads that, though they make, as we have seen, little or no advance in logical doctrine, they do tentatively raise and deal in some measure with the question of the source of knowledge of the Brahman or Atman. The view of the Brahmaņas, of course, is that knowledge is to be found in the Vedas, and the authority of the Vedic texts is not dis- cussed. In the Upanisads, however, we find that the question of the means of knowledge is definitely raised: the three Vedas or the four, which are some- times recognized, are not always recognized as the sources of complete know- ledge Cvetaketu, despite much Vedic learning, cannot solve the question of transmigration, Narada admits to Sanatkumāra his incompetence to under- stand the Atman. The Taittiriya Upanisad1 expressly reduces the knowledge

514 

The Philosophy of the Veda 

[Part V 

of the Vedas to an inferior position by assigning them to the stage of the mind- made Atman, which has to be surmounted before reaching the final truth. But these views were gradually and naturally supplemented by another, which makes the Upanisads an essential part, the secret instruction, of the Veda hence the term Vedanta which first occurs in the CvetaŚvatara Upanisad and denotes the Upanisads, as the end of the Veda in which its deepest secret is disclosed. 

2 

The Brāhmaṇas had recognized, beside study of the Veda, the duty of sacrifice, and the importance of asceticism, and on both these points the thinkers of the Upaniṣads were bound to take a clear stand. The sacrifice is least reputed in the Bṛhadaranyaka Upanisad where, with a certain insolence, the worship of anything except the self is derided, and the rela- tion of the ordinary worshipper to his gods is compared with that of housedogs. Again Yama is said to have his abode in the sacrifice, and the sacrifice in the fees. The Chandogya 3 also seems in part to recognize the demerits of the sacrifice. But it would be an error to think that the general depreciation of the sacrifice is characteristic of the Brahmans; it is clear that a few en- lightened minds had a poor opinion of the whole apparatus, but the normal view of the Upanisads is quite removed from that of opposition to sacrifice, which is often believed to mark them out. The sacrifice, however, is expressly relegated to an inferior place: the faithful performance of offerings takes a man but to the world of the Fathers, whence he will return to earth again in due course, and not thus can final liberation be won. On the other hand the actual performance of the sacrifice is rendered needless by the substitute for the ritual acts of allegorical acts: the three periods of life supersede the three Soma offerings, inhalation and speech the Agnihotra, the organs of the self the four priests, and so on. The tendency, however, to restore the sacri- fice to honour steadily grows the Katha recognizes it as of value. the ŚvetaŚvatara recommends recourse to it, the Maitrāyaṇīya asserts that without the study of the Veda, the observance of caste duties, and the following of the orders of life, through the stage of student householder, forest hermit, and wandering ascetic, the reunion of the individual and the personal self is impossible. Doubtless in this we can recognize the growing aversion of the Brahmans to the Buddhist and the Jain tenets.

The part of asceticism in the pursuit of knowledge is similar to that of the sacrifice. The Bṛhadaranyaka 10 is not inclined towards it, recognizing in it as in sacrifice at most a way to the lower bliss of the world of the Fathers,11

the Chandogya 1 substitutes the faith of the forest dweller for penance. The Taittiriya Upanisad, on the other hand, places value on Vedic study and asceticism, and even insists on the supreme value of the latter: the Mahānā- rāyaṇa 3 sets renunciation, Nyasa, above even asceticism: and from the Kena onwards the value of asceticism for the obtaining of the knowledge of the Brahman is absolutely recognized and sometimes insisted upon. In this, as in regard to Vedic study and sacrifice, the process is one of steady accommoda- tion to the popular view, which was at the same time the profitable view to the priests. It is needless, however, to see in this the fact of the borrowing of the theory of the Atman from an external source: the facts accord perfectly with a reform within the Brahmanical fold: the reformers gradually sink back into the main body, while their doctrine in some degree at least is adopted by the main body of the priests.

Nor in the oldest stratum of the Upanisads do we find the necessity of instruction by a teacher laid down: Yajñavalkya on several occasions teaches persons such as his wife, Maitreyi, informally and without initiation, and AŚvapati teaches the Brahmans who come to him freely. The rule of taking a teacher is absolute in the Katha,' and is approved in the Chandogya, where the teacher is regarded as being as essential as the removal of a bandage to a blindfolded man, who wishes to find his way home to Gan- dhara. In these texts the vague requirements also occur that a man should be endowed with self-restraint, renunciation, tranquillity, patience, and collectedness. 

9 

But beyond these minor matters, which are none of them recognized as essential in the oldest Upanisads, a further question arises, how far there can be real knowledge at all of the Atman. The natural desire of the philosopher is to know the Atman: the Upanisads are in very real sense the search for that knowledge, but the conviction is clearly early felt that there were serious difficulties in assuming the possibility of empiric means giving the desired result. The Rigveda already contained the idea that the first principle in some degree disguised itself, and the world of name and form becomes in the Bṛhadaranyaka 10 the immortal concealed in truth, or reality, and as the reality of reality is seen the self. The only normal sense which can be given to these passages is that suggested by the description of the whole universe in the Chandogya as a matter of words, a mere name. The reality of the world is empiric, the true reality is the Atman, which the empiric reality conceals. It follows, therefore, that all so-called knowledge is really ignorance, Avidya, and that in death in casting off the body the soul throws aside ignorance.12

The Philosophy of the Veda 

[Part V 

The Katha illustrates this theme: ordinary knowledge aims at pleasure, real knowledge at salvation, and it must be accorded through a teacher,2 and by the favour of the Atman,3 a doctrine which develops into the express declaration that the favour of the creator is essential. The CvetaŚvatara " carries us to the logical result and offers prayers to the gods for assistance, inculcating devotion, Bhakti, to god and to the teacher.

On the other hand, there arises in the doctrine of Yajnavalkya a distinct and different element: the self in this view cannot be known at all. There is no consciousness after death, he explains to Maitreyi, and the grounds of his explanation are that duality is essential for consciousness. The absolute self is unknowable, for there is no duality between it and anything else: the individual self is also unknowable because it must be the activity in knowing, and cannot be the object. The doctrine has echoes in other Upani- şads, and it results in fierce attacks on knowledge, which is ranked as worse than ignorance by the IŚa. The Katha lays stress on the necessity of turning the eye inwards in contrast to the mere use of the senses to grasp what is external, and insists that the only assertion that can be made of the self is the mere declaration of existence pure and simple. The way is, therefore, clearly open to the development of the doctrine alluded to in the earlier Upanisads, but not developed until later, which seeks by means of processes of physical and psychical disposition to produce the trance condition in which unity with the absolute, the only possible form of knowledge, is arrived at.

## 05. The Nature of the Absolute 

The Upanisads are essentially concerned with the endeavour to describe the nature of the absolute, and the rich abundance of attempts to succeed in this end, proved by the references to conflicting theories in the Upanisads, is clear proof of the busy mental activity of the period. From the earliest Upanisad we have, the view is clear that there is a unity, that it is necessary further to grasp the nature of that unity, and that the proper names of the unity are either the Brahman or the Atman. The two ideas whose history we have seen in the Brahmanas are used constantly in alternation with each other. It is clear that they must have been felt to be practically akin. 

Many of these attempts were, it is clear, of little worth: Bālāki Gārgya in

The Nature of the Absolute

his interview with AjataŚatru puts forward twelve 1 or sixteen views of the nature of the absolute. They are all of the same type, the soul in the sun, the moon, lightning, ether, fire, water, the person in a mirror, the sound that follows one as he goes, the person in the quarters, the shadow, the person in the body, &c., to which the king opposes in reply the conception of that whence the breaths proceed, and on which the worlds, gods, and men depend. Other suggestions made by Śakalya 2 which treat breath, love, forms, ether, &c., as the basis of the absolute are refuted by Yajnavalkya, who also rejects the suggestions of speech, the breath, the eye, the ear, mind, and the heart laid before him by Janaka as doctrines enunciated on this head. Yajnavalkya shows that these things are only the basis of the attributes of the divine unity, and that it is necessary to go behind the mere attributes or their manifestation, which can only be done by recognizing the essential identity of the absolute and our own spirit. The Brahmans who with Uddālaka are instructed by AŚvapati Kaikeya are supporters of the claims of heaven, sun, wind, ether, water, and earth as the absolute unity, there conceived as the Atman VaiŚva- nara, an idea borrowed from the Agni VaiŚvänara which forms the subject of discussion in the secret doctrine of the fire in the Śatapatha Brahmana. The king, on his part, insists that the Atman must be within, not an external object. A much longer and more elaborate series of imperfect views is repre- sented in the instruction of Narada by Sanatkumāra, where from name the advance is made through speech, mind, conception or judgement (samkalpa), thought, intuition (dhyāna), knowledge (vijñāna), force, food (i.e. earth), water, heat, ether, memory, and longing (aŚā), to the breath which is the individual soul, and finally to the great one, Bhuman, which comprehends all, fills space, and is identical with the principle of egoism, Ahamkära, and the self, Atman, in man. The transition from the individual to the great one is made thus: truth depends on knowledge, this on thought (mati), this on faith, this on concentration (niḥṣṭhā), this on productive power, this on pleasure, which exists in the unlimited.

More important than these theories are others: Indra and the demon Virocana went to Prajapati for instruction: he first describes the Atman as the body, a view thought adequate by Virocana, who is the prototype of all men who merely see in the body the hope of immortality, and, therefore, deck it out on death with gay raiment. Prajapati then explains the self as the spirit in dreams, but Indra is not satisfied, since the spirit is still in this con- dition opposed to a world beyond itself. Prajapati then propounds the self in dreamless sleep, where there is no distinction of subject and object, which he explains as not the annihilation of the self, but its entry upon the fullest 1 BAU. ii. 1; KU. iv.

light in identification with the absolute. With this view must be compared a more developed one expressed in the Taittiriya Upanisad,1 where there are distinguished five Atmans; the first is the annamaya, which corresponds to the body; then the pranamaya, which corresponds to the life of the breaths or vital airs; the manomaya, the self of the mind, which here clearly means the activity of the self as conscious will in such actions as sacrifice and study; the vijñānamaya, in which for sacrifice is substituted knowledge and worship of the deity in that manner; and finally the anandamaya, that of joy before whom words and thought recoil, not finding him. This last self is not an object of knowledge, and hence it is described as not real-empirically, as unconscious and unutterable. In it is bliss, which is broken by the belief in any difference between the self and it. 

2 

Other efforts are made to realize the Atman by a process of examination of the merits of the different claimants. Thus we have the account of the rivalry of the senses foreshadowed in the Brāhmaṇas carried out in detail. The breath is the victor over speech, the eye, the ear, and mind, because when all the others go from the body still it is left animated, and from another point of view breath alone is able in the conflict of the gods, the senses, and the demons to overthrow the demons.3 Another version 4 adds to the other powers the cosmical equivalents, and ranges speech, eye, car and breath against one another, and fire, sun, moon, and wind against one another; in each case the result is the victory of breath and wind. In the Kausitaki Upanisad, following the Aitareya Brahmana, the cosmic divinities fire, sun, moon, lightning, and the psychic divinities, speech, eye, ear, mind, enter into the wind and the breath respectively. The same idea occurs in an earlier version of the Catapatha Brahmana: in sleep speech enters the breath, and so with eye, mind, ear, and correspondingly with fire, sun, moon, and the quarters in their relation to the wind. Hence we frequently find that the breath is set up as an idea of the Brahman, but merely to be rejected as inadequate.

Still more clearly inadequate are the identifications of Brahman with mind," which as in the Brahmaņas never achieves a decisive place of im- portance, and with more material concepts, such as the sun and as the ether. The sun is interesting, as it is clear that efforts were made- as in Egypt in the reform of Akhenaten-to penetrate beyond the mere physical sun to the man in the sun, with whom the dying man declares his identity.10 The real

relation to the sun is, however, declared to be something above that,1 and similarly against the conception of the absolute as there is set the view that the absolute is in the ether, and is the controller of the ether.2 

Another set of conceptions is rather different: they are not so much real efforts to explain the absolute as merely to bring it into contact with the sacrifice it was clearly the most natural thing in the world for the various schools, which were contemporary with the development of the Brahman, to apply to the chief concepts of their special branch of Vedic literature the idea of identification with the absolute. Thus the schools of the Rigveda fixed upon the Uktha,3 the litany, especially that of the Mahavrata ceremony as the absolute, the Samaveda schools chose the Saman and in special the Udgitha," and the schools of the Yajurveda the horse 5 offered at the sacrifice. Much more common is the view that by the mystic syllable, Om, originally no more perhaps than a formal word of assent, the Brahman is denoted." 

7 

A more advanced conception is to be found in the Aitareya Aranyaka which uses the old conception of breath, but identifies with it Prajñā, 'intel- lect'. On intellect the whole world is based, it is guided by intellect, and know- ledge is the absolute. The same view is expressed in the Kaușitaki Upanisad 8 where the identity of breath and intellect is asserted absolutely, but also later on is more precisely investigated: it shows that the objects of sense depend on the organs of sense, and the latter are dependent in turn on intellect, but it still adheres to the identification of the two. The Chandogya itself identifies breath, ether, and bliss. The breath, therefore, still here and there appears with its claim to be the Atman, but it is also now and then made dependent on it, or even the shadow of it. 

9 

But the nature of the Brahman is not intellect alone: it is also bliss and reality, and these ideas are here and there already united as in the later Upanisads, though the enumeration of the triad as the actual character of the Brahman is not actually found in the early Upanisads. In its place the Taittiriya once presents the Brahman as being (sat), thought (cit), and eternity, where ananta, ' eternity', stands probably in error for the Ananda, ' bliss', of the later triad. As being the Brahman, it is at once being and not- being the old duplication of the Rigveda,10 which asserts that at first there was neither being nor not-being is recognized here and there, but in the definite sense that, as not-being, the absolute is not empirical being, and that as being it is also not empirical being, so that the question is one of terminology

alone and is decided in favour of the appellation being. Much more important is the attribute of thought, which is asserted repeatedly in the doctrine of Yajnavalkya." He there asserts that the hearer, the seer, the understander, the knower, are all unknown: they are the soul within, which again is in essence the divine, for all else than it is liable to suffering. In this subject of knowledge ether or space is interwoven it is the meeting-place of all sounds, smells, sights, and other experiences. The different organs-and their functions-are only names for the one subject. In his conversation with Janaka, the philosopher traces the Atman as the knowing subject, which persists without change through the stages of waking, dreaming, deep sleep, death, trans- migration, and final deliverance of the soul. The spirit in the waking state beholds the good and the evil of the world, but it is not moved by it, since as subject it is really incapable of affection in the state of dreaming it builds up its own world, and in deep dreamless sleep, wrapped round by the intellec- tual self, it has no consciousness of objects, and yet is not unconscious. The self is compared to a lump of salt which has no inner or outer aspects it is simply a single unit, and so consciousness has no inner and outer side, and is one unity alone. The Brahman is also the light of lights, and through it alone is there any light in the universe. For the wise man there is perpetual and abiding light, and this idea in the later Upanisads appears in a variety of metaphors such as the day of Brahman which is eternal. 

6 

5 

The conception of the self as essentially consciousness is not, however, confined to Yajnavalkya: the same view is expressed, in words which may be dependent on the Bṛhadaraṇyaka, in the Chandogya, and the Aitareya and the Kausitaki texts as we have seen emphasize the same conception under the view that the self is intellect. In neither case, however, need we assume dependence on Yajnavalkya, for unlike the case of the Chandogya the line of argument differs, and is, in the later case directly, and in the former indirectly, linked with the conception of the self as breath, which does not appear in the development of the ideas of Yajnavalkya. 

The nature of the absolute as bliss is also asserted by Yajnavalkya," who brings the conception into the closest relation with his idea of its nature. The bliss which he contemplates is that of the man in dreamless sleep, when the consciousness of individuality is lost, and when the self, therefore, is above

all pain and grief and enjoys pure bliss, whence it is a simple step to the equation of the absolute and bliss. Nor is there much doubt that here again the Chandogya1 depends on the Bṛhadaraṇyaka, when it enunciates the doctrine of the absolute as ether, breath, and joy under the mystic name of Kha. The Kaușitaki 3 also seems to borrow from the Bṛhadaraṇyaka, and the whole idea is further developed in the Taittiriya,4 in the Anandavalli. There special stress is laid on the error of seeking to find any division of subject and object in bliss: that would create division and would admit the idea of fear, which can arise only from division. The dependence on the Bṛhadaranyaka of this doctrine is borne out by the relation of the anandamaya self to the vijñānamaya: in the former text they are the same idea, and, therefore, the conscious self is the highest, there being no difference of subject and object in it the Taittiriya refines by making the vijñanamaya still have the distinction of subject and object, and then erecting the anandamaya above it in rank. It is characteristic of the growth of these distinctions that, later on," the anan- damaya itself became regarded as a mere sheath (koŚa) in which the self or the Brahman resided. 

The other side of this exaltation of the bliss of the absolute is of course the view that all the world is misery, but the pessimism of the Upanisads is moderate we hear of the miseries of old age and death or disease, and trouble which the knowledge of the absolute removes, but the growth of the spirit of pessimism is only to be traced in Upanisads of the quite late class. 

7 

But, despite the giving to the absolute of these three attributes or charac- teristics, Yajnavalkya returns constantly to the fact that they are not to be taken in the empirical sense, and that, therefore, our knowledge of the absolute is non-existent. (The most drastic expression for this view is the formula neti neti, not so, not so ', which denies to the absolute any and every attempt to define it in terms of ordinary knowledge) Its existence is a transcendental reality, which is essentially from the empírical point of view a nonentity; its consciousness involves the essential fusion of subject and object, and the transcendence of their diversity, although the phraseology of the Upanisads always treats the Atman as subject, and, therefore, is not ordinary consciousness at all, and the bliss arises from this state of non-dis- tinction. Hence we have two different conceptions which are repeated times without number: on the one hand every empirical attribute is attributed to the absolute and also denied of it: in the second place the most contradictory

[Part V 

observations are made regarding it. The ideas thus enunciated are clear: the absolute is not in space 1 which is expressed by the assertion that it is infinitely large and infinitely small, that space is interwoven in it, and that it is all pervading. The absolute is not in time: 2 hence it appears as above the three times, independent of the past and the future, at its feet time rolls on its course on the one hand it is of infinite duration, but at the same time it is of the instantaneous character of the flash of the lightning, or the swift rush of thought. The absolute is also free from causal connexion: 3 it is said to be absolutely without diversity, and this point is variously developed the Katha is emphatic that the absolute is independent of becoming and not becoming, of good and evil, of past and future, the knowing seer is not born, does not die, abides from everlasting. The IŚã 5 insists that it is unmoving, yet swifter than mind; far, yet near; within, yet without the universe; above knowledge and ignorance; that it differs essentially from coming into being and not coming into being. The final answer to the question of the nature of the Atman is that recorded for us in a legend by Śankara: Vāṣkali asked Bahva as to the nature of the Brahman: the latter remained silent, and on being pressed for an answer replied, 'I teach you, indeed, but you understand not: silence is the Atman.'

## 06. The Absolute and the Universe 

The theory of Yajnavalkya asserts, as we have seen, that the absolute is unknowable and not definable by any empirical predicates. It, therefore, becomes obviously a pressing question to connect the empirical and the real universes: the gulf between the two is only accentuated by asserting, in so determined a manner, that there is a deep division between the one and the many. The relation of the universe as known to the one is, however, the pro- blem which all philosophies find insoluble in greater or less degree, and the efforts of the Upaniṣads to bridge the difference are not at all satisfactory. The answer given in fact is merely that the absolute is the same as the world, or that the world is the product of the Brahman. The difficulty, however, arises, in considering these passages of the Upanisads, which present the doctrines of cosmogonism and pantheism in close and inextricable union, to know whether we have here efforts to explain the Brahman understood in the

The polemic is rather against knowledge as the one way of salvation, but a reply to the Mundaka specifically need not be assumed.

sense of Yajnavalkya, or merely the natural continuation of the doctrines of the Brahmanas. It is on this point that it is necessary to part com- pany with Deussen, who in his aim at system assumes that the doctrine of the absolute, as expounded in the Bṛhadaranyaka, underlies the whole thought of the Upanisads. We can only say that the deeper view of Yājña- valkya may, though not very probably, have been held now and then by those who express the more crude views of the identity of the absolute and the universe. 

In the Aitareya Araṇyaka, an early text, we find a simple and clear assertion of the presence of the self, Atman, in living things, but in different degrees, without here, as yet, any implication of the absolute character of the self or its identity with the universe. He who knows more and more clearly the self attains fuller being; the self is revealed in an ascending order or revelation in plants and trees, animals, and man. In plants and trees sap only is found, in animals consciousness is present, but man excels since he is highly endowed with intelligence, saying what he has known, seeing what he has known, knowing to-morrow, the world and its opposite; by the mortal he desires the immortal, being thus endowed. As for the others, hunger and thirst comprise the power of knowledge of animals; they say not and see not what they have known. Man also is likened to the sea, for the insatiable nature of his desires; whatever he attains he desires to go beyond it; if he gains the sky, yet is he not content.1 

The pantheistic view is undoubtedly present in the many passages in which the development of the world from the absolute is expressed in metaphors: thus in the metaphor of the spider from which the thread proceeds, or the fire whence come forth the sparks. Often too the Atman is declared to pervade the whole of the universc, it is likened to the lump of salt which in water disappears, indeed, but leaves all pervaded by it,3 a view which must be older than the more refined conception, which, as we have seen, is applied to the Atman when the object of comparison is a lump of salt, which has no inner or outer aspect, but is but one in itself. The Katha Upanisad compares the self to the light which penetrates everywhere, and adapts itself to every form. This view is found also in another form, in the laying down of the view of the self as the inward controller, as the greatest of powers, in which the heaven and the earth alike are contained. This view sets the self over against the world, and in doing so it adopts the old view that the seat of the self is the

Aristotle', is inadmissible. The effort to make personalities out of the Upanisad teachers is vain, while to treat Aghamarṣana as the first philosopher of India is absurd.

heart, in which accordingly the lord of the universe resides, infinitely small, yet greater than the earth, the atmosphere, and the heaven. He is the pro- tector of the universe, the guardian of mankind, the bond which holds the worlds together and prevents them coming into conflict. It is in this connexion that the terms 2 tat tvam asi, that thou art', and etad vai tat,3 

3 that is this', must be understood they assert the essential identity of the self and the universe, but they do not necessarily or originally depend on the adoption of the view of Yājñavalkya, though they may later be regarded as a natural adaptation of it to meet the question of the relation of the universe and the final reality. 

The impossibility of ascribing these views of the absolute and the world to attempts to solve the problem suggested by the transcendental view of the absolute is seen in the many cases where the realism is material and gross : thus the old doctrine of the creator, the primeval substance created by him, and his entry into it, which appears in the Aitareya Upanisad, cannot be treated as a later development of a primitive identification of the universe and the absolute it derives directly from the Brāhmaṇas, and shows the early, not the later, date of the Upanisad, as compared with the doctrine of Yājña- valkya. The same primitive ideas must be seen in the view that the Purusa dwells in the body as a span in height, as flame without smoke. 

:

From this cosmogonism or pantheism it is not a difficult step to arrive at atheism the attitude of the Brahmaņas, as we have seen, is not theistic, for they tend undoubtedly to depart from the primitive conception of Prajapati as a creator god in favour of the idea of the more impersonal Brahman or the Atman. But the tendency to abstraction was always, doubtless, confronted with the realism and clinging to personality of the average intellect, and that realism results in the growing tendency to separate the individual and the supreme self, which is a perfectly natural development from the hasty unity of pantheisms. The Katha Upanisad undoubtedly shows this tendency in its distinction of the supreme and the individual self as light and shadow, and in the doctrine of the grace of the creator which gives man saving know- ledge the idea is, however, far more effectively brought out in the Cveta- Śvatara, where the identity of the supreme and the individual souls is not indeed denied, but can only be realized by the favour of the supreme lord, the IŚvara, who thus appears as in some measure distinct from the individual soul. The IŚvara is also a maker of magic, and the universe is the product, the illusion. The Upanisad shows no trace of the presupposition of the doctrine of Yajñavalkya: it is adequately explained as the mere develop- ment of primitive pantheism, or cosmogonism.

In this Upanisad it is of importance that the conception of theism is allied 1 CU. iii. 14. 2; 13. 7; viii. 1. 3; BAU. iii. i. 11, 12; cf. CU. vi. 8. 3; TU. ii. 6;

to the name of Rudra: the Vedic gods in the Upanisads exist as much as men,1 but they are nothing more important than men, and need the knowledge of the Brahman as much as men; Indra and Prajapati himself are, though the keepers of the door of heaven, unable to turn back the man who knows the Brahman. The Vedic gods are in themselves not enough to account for the prominence of the theistic aspect it is essentially connected with Śiva or later with Viṣṇu, new great gods of the popular side of Brahmanism. The new relation is seen in the use of the term IŚvara, IŚa, or synonyms, of the god, and in the use of these terms later of the supreme god in Indian philosophy : these are names obviously in harmony with the chief name of Rudra as the İŚana, the lord, among the gods and the world in general. 

The nature of the process by which the universe comes into being is con- sidered under many different aspects, but they all rest on the old hypothesis of the mode of creation of the universe. They adopt just the same sort of language: there was according to one version first not-being, which was being: it arose an egg was evolved: it lay for a year: it split open into two halves, one of silver which is the earth, and one of gold which is the heaven. The material of the world as it exists is in the most primitive view the waters, an idea already found in the Rigveda 2 and this conception is adhered to in the Aitareya Upanisad. A more developed, and probably later, view is that of the Chandogya Upanisad, which makes the Brahman resolve to create the world, and therefore to create heat, whence arosc, as sweat arises in man, the waters, and from the waters came food, after which the supreme self enters into the three as the individual self, the Jivātman. Thereafter a further step is taken the Jivātman having entered, the three elements are mixed together so that existing things are composed of the three separate elements, an idea which is the source of the distinction of the subtle and the gross elements, which occurs as such first in the PraŚna Upanisad," where the earth, water, heat, wind, and ether elements are distinguished from the earth, water, heat, wind, and ether. A further and very important development of this theory is that of the Taittiriya Upanisad which derives from the Atman the ether, wind, fire, water, and earth. This five-fold division may be regarded as the established order in the philosophy of India, and the fact that the Aitareya'

has not it in definite form shows that it is earlier than the Taittiriya. With the five elements correspond the five senses. 

The absolute, after the production of the elements, must enter into the world, and many texts refer to this entry. Hence the world is penetrated throughout organic nature by the self of the absolute, which exists in the plant world, in insect life, in animal life, and in man, in things born of the egg, born alive, and sprout-born 1 or born from sweat, a category including insects.2 The tree and the plant alike are regarded as animated by a spirit. The idea is seen frequently in the doctrine of transmigration where animals, insects, vegetables and gods appear as subject to transmigration. The Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upanisad has, in a legend which may be compared with the famous observa- tions of Plato in the Symposion, a theory of the Atman as neither male nor female which is cleft asunder and attains fresh unity in the creation of new life, human and animal alike.

It was inevitable that, in the view of the universe which regarded it as a creation, and distinguished between the soul of man and his body, there should arise the conception of the soul of the universe related to it as the soul in man to his body: this conception is made material in the person of Hiranyagarbha, who in the Rigveda is the golden germ which enters into creation after the first action of the creator, or of Brahman as masculine. The position of either of these deities is first quite distinctly asserted in the Kausitaki Upanisad, and the idea appears in prominence only in the theistic ŚvetaŚvatara Upanisad, where a third name occurs, the red seer, Kapilaṛṣi, a term often, but certainly wrongly, assumed to refer to the founder--who is a very legendary figure and may owe his name to this passage of the Samkhya system. But the idea is found in a less theoretic form in the Katha Upanisad, where in the development of principles the great self' stands after the undeveloped and the primeval spirit, and later in the Buddhi of the Samkhya.

The absolute is not merely the creator of the universe: through it the universe after creation continues to live and move and have its being in its bliss the universe tastes of bliss itself. Yajñavalkya expresses this thought in his conversation with Gārgi, in which 10 he points out that at the bidding of the imperishable one heaven and earth, the minutes, hours, days and nights, half-months, and months, the seasons, and the years are kept asunder, and the streams run from the mountains cast and west, men praise the generous givers, the gods favour the sacrificer, and the Fathers desire the offerings to the dead.

absolute and the AŚvattha tree, which sends its shoots downwards. He is the dike which holds apart the worlds to keep them asunder,1 but the same metaphor, by another turn, is made to yield the idea that he is the bridge which secures continuity between the past and the future. From another point of view the absolute is the ruler, the Antaryamin of the universe, who is the controlling power in the earth, water, fire, atmosphere, wind, sky, sun, the heavenly regions, moon and stars, ether, darkness, and light, of all living creatures, and of the eight organs, the whole complex forming his body, being distinct from him and not knowing him, but yet being ruled by him. In this way again we come to the idea of the world soul, but the difference between this and the view of the CvetaŚvatara Upanisad is that the internal ruler is still merely the absolute. 

But an important conclusion follows inevitably from the view that the inner power in all is the absolute: he causes the man whom he will lead on high from these worlds to do good works, and he causes the man whom he will lead downwards to do evil works. The gods are also determined by him: the grass cannot be burned by Agni, nor swept away by Vayu, apart from the will of the Brahman. This idea is found repeatedly in the Upanisads, and is contrasted with the position of the spirit, which leaves the world after having known the soul and the true desires, and whose part then in all worlds is the life of freedom: he who departs without knowing the soul has in all worlds a life of constraint. The recognition of the freedom of the self is due to the recognition of the fact that the self is the real actor, and that, therefore, the constraint, to which it seems to be subject, is the constraint which it itself exercises on itself: as the Maitrāyaṇīya Upanisad has it, Ile fetters him- self by himself, as a bird by its nest.'

An interesting development of the doctrine occurs in the Jaiminiya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa; the picture is drawn of a deity, described probably as 'the good deity', and therefore indicating Agni-Rudra, who bars the passage to the sun or beyond to the soul, on the score of the evil he has done, declaring that only the doer of good deeds may pass. The soul replies, Thou didst see whatever I used to do; thou wouldst not have made me do it (i.e. had it been evil); thou thyself art the docr. The answer satisfies the deity, who, there- fore, lets him pass. The dangerous implications of the doctrine are obvious and undeniable. 

If the will is thus empirically completely subject to determination, it is inevitable that, with the growing tendency to view the relation of the soul to the absolute from the point of view of theism, there should arise the position

The Philosophy of the Veda 

[Part V 

that the absolute assumes the appearance of a personal providence. This is clearly the case in the CvetaŚvatara Upanisad,1 where the Atman is the over- seer of actions, who apportions his qualities to each person, who executes justice, who restrains the evil, allots good fortune, and brings to maturity the actions of the soul. The Katha Upanisad 2 faintly adumbrates the same idea in the view that the wise self-existent one has assigned ends for all time, an idea which an interpolator has made more precise by adding, to the destruction of the metre, the word yāthātathyatas, according to the quality of the works of the individual souls. 

5 

In detail we learn very little indeed of the creation of the earth and the world: the old Vedic ideas coexist, according to which there are three worlds, earth, air, and heaven, but the primeval waters are regarded in the Aitareya Upanisad3 as lying above and below these regions. They are also said to be interwoven in the ether, by which space may be meant, as the latter is in the Brahman. From the practice of equating the regions with the worlds of the sacrifice, Bhūḥ, Bhuvaḥ, and Svar, a fourth region is added as Mahas, in the Taittiriya Upanisad denoting the Brahman: the Mundaka adds three more, Janas, Tapas, and Satya are given as their names in the Mahānārāyaṇa :* still later, seven lower worlds are invented to correspond with them. A different conception is, however, found in the Bṛhadaranyaka Upanisad,' where on the basis of the old cosmic egg there is devised the view that the inhabited world is surrounded by the earth, and this again by the ocean, the world being 32 days' journey of the chariot of the sun in breadth, the earth 64, and the sea 128. Where the heaven and the earth as the two layers of the egg of the universe meet, there is the space of a razor edge or the wing of a fly, by which access is attained to the place of the offerers of the horse sacrifice, no doubt the back of heaven. A divergent view is found shortly after, in which there are ten layers over the universe, the worlds of the wind, the atmosphere, the Gandharvas, the sun, moon, stars, the gods, Indra, Prajapati, and Brahman. The only importance of these questions attaches to the case of the sun and the moon, which become associated with the doctrine of trans- migration the sun, indeed, is actually apparently deemed nearer the earth than the moon.

In the later systems of India it is an essential principle that, in accordance with the doctrine of transmigration, there can never be an origin of the world in time, and, since, on the other hand, the origination of the world was an accepted doctrine, the difficulty was overcome by the theory of the periodic destruction and regeneration of the world. This doctrine, which has been wrongly seen in the Atharvaveda, is certainly not to be found in any older Upanisad, and must be regarded as a definite sign of late date. It is found in the CvetaŚvatara Upanisad1 when the god, who puts forth many times one net after another in space, is compared to a spider. It is also made clear that it is the actions of the soul which result in the activity of the creator in appor- tioning to each person all their attributes. The later Upaniṣads 2 recognize frankly the destruction of the universe by periodic fire. The only idea in the older texts which affords the slightest analogy is the mere mention of the fact that into the Brahman the individual must fall on death, an idea which has no logical connexion with the developed theory. The latter may have arisen as a mere desire to apply to all the worlds what applied to the individual: more probably perhaps it is due to the needs of the doctrine of transmigration.

## 07. Māyā and Prakṛti-Illusion and Nature 

(a) ILLUSION 

In the doctrine of Yajnavalkya we have seen the tendency of the Upani- şads to assert over again, and in still more emphatic terms, the unity of the world, which the poets of the Rigveda already foreshadowed, and to deduce from it the conclusion that the world is nothing that is real in the full sense of the word, since everything in it is not ultimately to be regarded as having a truth of its own. In what sense, then, can the empiric world be said to exist? This Yājñavalkya leaves vague, but in his exposition to Maitreyi of the doctrine that after death there is no consciousness he uses terms to which later at least great weight was attached. A duality is necessary, he argued, for one to see another, smell another, hear another, and so forth, and in death no such duality is present; the phrase, however, which he uses in this contention is 'where there is a duality as it were (iva)', and it may be deduced, not unfairly, from the addition of the qualification that he was not prepared to admit as absolutely certain the existence of the duality. Later in the Upani- şad we have similar wording, 'when there seems to be another', the same

particle being used. Here again we cannot simply ignore the qualification; to do so is as one-sided as to ascribe to it the value of a definite assertion of the unreality or illusory character of the universe. What we have is the germ of the illusion theory. 

A further passage which has been adduced in this connexion is the declara- tion of the Chandogya Upanisad1 regarding the modifications of the three fundamental constituents of being, fire, water, food; just as all that is made of clay, copper, or iron, is only a modification, a verbal expression (vācāram- bhana), a mere name, the reality being clay, copper, or iron, so all things can be reduced to the three primary forms of reality. Further, all reality, it is clearly indicated, is reducible to reality only, all things being mere modifica- tions, &c. In Deussen's view 2 we have here the first open assertion of the unreality of the universe, a doctrine which shortly afterwards was to be realized by Parmenides in the famous declaration : 

τῷ πάντ' ὄνομ ̓ ἔσται 

ὅσσα βροτοὶ κατέθεντο πεποιθότες εἶναι ἀληθῆ γίγνεσθαί τε καὶ ὄλλυσθαι, 

and later by Spinoza in his doctrine of modes of the one substance, God. The alternative view 3 is to regard the whole as frankly realistic; the name is not a mere name in the sense of disguising a reality; on the contrary it serves to mark out a reality, just as the phrase nama-rupa can be used to designate a concrete individual made up of intellectual and other faculties and matter. In this case we have a doctrine frankly pantheistic, but not of illusion. The difficulty of deciding is increased by the uncertainty of the correct rendering of the text, which Deussen interprets as directly asserting that 'change is a mere matter of words, a simple name', treating the words vācārambhaṇaṁ vikāro nāmadheyam as a distinct sentence, instead--as is possible of taking it as a predicate description, 'a matter of words, a change, a simple name', and it would be unwise to draw any far-reaching conclusion from the passage. 

We find also in the Bṛhadaranyaka Upanisad in a verse which occurs with slight variation in the Katha, a distinct assertion that there is no diversity and that a failure to realize this fact is the source of repeated death. The IŚa emphatically demands that the universe be merged in God, and, moreover, denies becoming and passing away, thus condemning the doctrine. of the reality of change; this at least is Deussen's interpretation, though it is open to argue that the real sense is merely that the absolute stands above becoming and passing away, which it transcends. In the late Maitrāyaṇīya Upanisad' we find the comparison of the absolute with the spark which, made

to revolve, creates apparently a fiery circle, an idea which is taken up and expanded by Gauḍapada in the Maṇḍükya Kärikā, and which undoubtedly is consistent with the conception of the illusory nature of empirical reality. In other cases adduced by Deussen 1 there is no need to suspect any idea of the world as unreal, the frequent assertion, that with the knowledge of the self all is known, does not exclude the reality of what is derived from the self; the reality of the absolute may be contrasted 3 with empirical reality, which is styled real by man, without making the latter an illusion; when the Aitareya asserts that the universe is founded in consciousness and guided by it, it assumes its reality, not its merely apparent existence, and, if the elements of being rest on the consciousness and it on the Prana, we need not suspect any lack of reality in them.

Far more importance attaches to a late Upanisad. The precise character of the nature of the external world is sunimed up finally in the doctrine of the ŚvetaŚvatara Upanisad,' which sees in the world other than the absolute- which it conceives in a theistic way-an illusion, Māyā, a term thus first introduced into the philosophy of the Upanisads, to become, through the adoption of this theory of the universe by Gauḍapada and Śankara, the basis of the orthodox Vedanta system. It would, however, it is clear, be a mistake to regard the new term as being a mere individual innovation of the ŚvetāŚvatara school without previous preparation in the literary tradition. The idea of the concealment of the divine nature by illusion is seen in the Atharvaveda, where it is said that the flower of the water, who is Hiranya- garbha, the personal Brahman, in whom are fixed gods and men as spokes in a nave, is concealed by illusion, and the illusions of Indra in his many shapes are mentioned in the Rigveda." It may, therefore, be assumed that the term had obtained considerable favour in philosophic circles,10 before it appears in the Upanisad as a definite doctrine of importance. Still more important is the fact that the term was by no means ill adapted to express the nature of the relation of the empirical world to the real absolute, as it was conceived by Yajnavalkya. It is, of course, impossible to say that the actual term and its precise connotation would have approved themselves to that sage, or to those who evolved the doctrines which passed current under his name: on the other hand, the doctrine is a legitimate and natural development from the principles which he enunciated. They are clearly not to be derived in any reasonable way from a system, which was pantheistic or cosmogonic, and in which, therefore, the assumption that the world was illusory would have been ridiculous. A pantheism and still more a cosmogonism are under the danger of falling to the level of materialism, but not of evoking an illusionism.

The Philosophy of the Veda 

[Part V 

A very different suggestion as to the development of ideas is put forward by Schayer.1 On this theory the Maya doctrine comes in as the expression of a conception wholly alien to the normal Brahmanical idea of the regular working of the world, in which nature and the ritual stand in constant paral- lelism. The Brahman signifies the regular and orderly procedure of the universe; Māyā, on the other hand, introduces the conception of the unregu- lated, self-determined, intervention of a god; Indra's Maya in the Rigveda 2 is the expression of his might, revealed in his great deeds. When, naturally, opposition came into being directed against the Brahmanical conception of the Übermensch whose knowledge makes him ruler of the universe, we find the idea of the necessity of divine intervention as in the Katha Upanisad,3 and the condemnation by the IŚa of knowledge as even more unsatisfactory than ignorance, and finally in the CvetaŚvatara 5 the natural step is taken of ascribing to god the epithet māyāvin. The suggestion is ingenious but uncon- vincing. The CvetaŚvatara certainly does not mean that god is a real creator and that matter is his real creation; the sense of delusion or illusion" is para- 

mount. 

(b) NATURE 

While, however, one side of the teaching of the Upanisads develops in this brilliant manner, and in the hands of Gauḍapada and Śankara emerges as the chef d'œuvre of the Indian philosophical intellect, another and important scheme of philosophy was growing up, and was destined to exhibit itself, at a period not far distant from the close of the great Upanisads, in a living and effective form. The existence of this system as the definite Samkhya of the classical period is not attested until comparatively late: the oldest text-book, the Samkhya Kārikā, may be assigned to about the fourth century A. D.," and for the earlier form of the system we are reduced to conjectures built on that text, the history of the parallel system of Yoga, and the indications of the epic, which knows well the Samkhya and Yoga systenis, but which in regard to its date is so uncertain, that it does not necessarily afford us any information older than that contained in, and to be inferred from, the

• Schayer's effort (cf. also pp. 42 f.) to establish the doctrine that Māyā is a free creation, not an illusion, is as ingenious as it is unconvincing. There is no evidence that the idea of illusion was unknown to India in connexion with a juggler's work (contrast the stories given ibid. pp. 53), and the 

synonyms of Maya include such as Gandharvanagara. The idea of Māyā is akin to the product of the juggler in the Ratnavali who conjures up the appearance of a fire, into which the king rushes, whereas none exists. Cf. Asanga's account in the Sūtrālam- kāra, as given by Schayer himself (ZII. ii. 103-5), which is perfectly clear as to the unreality of Māyā. 

7 A later date is usually given (cf. Garbe, Samkhya und Yoga, p. 7), but the earlier date is now the most probable; see Winternitz, Gesch. d. ind. Lit. ii. 256; iii. 452 f.

Samkhya Kārikā itself. Very briefly put,' the classical Samkhya system discards entirely the idea of an absolute: it reduces the universe to a multi- tude of individual subjects, which have nothing true about them save their subjectivity, a subjectivity which has no creative power and is not properly realized at all by having an objective content. On the contrary, it is only by error in any way connected with the existing world, through its fancied con- nexion with Prakṛti, nature'. Through the development of Prakṛti there arises the principle called the great one or intellect, Mahan or Buddhi: the Prakṛti is, therefore, to be regarded as purely unconscious, a conception vaguely analogous to the Aristotelian Hyle, and connected, directly as it would seem, with the older views of the Rigveda and the Brahmanas as to the primitive condition of the universe as a chaos. The development of con- sciousness must therefore, it would appear, be cosmic, and the Mahan or Buddhi would thus correspond to the Hiranyagarbha of the later Upanisads and the Vedanta, the spirit which, in the earlier view, appeared on the waters after the creation of the waters by Prajapati or the Brahman. But at the same time the Buddhi is the first element of the subtle body, the Liñga, which is the essence of the individual spirit, and which passes through trans- migration. The Buddhi serves as the basis for the development of the prin- ciple of individualism, Ahamkara, from which are derived on the one hand the mind and the ten organs-or rather potentialities or faculties of sense, five of perception, and five of action, and on the other hand the subtle elements, from which in their turn come the gross clements, though an epic variant gives in lieu the elements and the objects of sense, sound, &c.2 The Linga, which is perhaps most appropriately called the 'psychic apparatus', contains in itself all the elements down to the subtle elements, and even of the gross elements it has the fine parts, and it is through it that the individual subject experiences -or rather seems to experience-the facts of this world. The experience is painful and unhappy, even though alleviated by the joys of earth, and the real aim of life is to be rid of the connexion with nature. But that connexion does not really exist: it is only thought to exist by an error and, when this error of ignorance is removed, then the connexion is seen not to exist and ceases to exist, the subject being freed from any connexion with an object, and on the other hand, the Prakṛti is freed from any pain or trouble, since being absolutely unconscious in the absence of subject there is no possibility of its suffering or enjoying anything. Strictly speaking, therefore, the spirit is never troubled In the main I agree with Deussen (Gesch. * Deussen, Gesch. der Phil. I. iii. 497. This

or suffers anything or enjoys anything: it merely illumines nature, which accordingly suffers, but is set free by the cessation of illumination. But the difference of the result in the two cases is enormous: the subject by ceasing to have an object is emancipated for all time, the Prakṛti in that one case is delivered, but that is a matter of indifference since the infinite number of other souls means that Prakṛti is ever being unrolled for the gaze of the subject and ever is suffering. 

The whole theory is one mass of difficult paradoxes, despite its seeming elegance and simplicity of structure. The main basis of the conception, that there is suffering through the connexion of the soul with nature, is contra- dicted by the fact that there is really no connexion: the suffering is pro- duced by a connexion which does not exist, and is only imagined to exist, but an imagined connexion is no ground for results which a real connexion alone could produce. The relation of the one Prakṛti with the psychical apparatuses which are not conscious except under the illumination of the subject is never clearly explained, or perhaps understood.1 At best we may endeavour to conceive the position that the connexion-which, however, as we have seen, is not really existent of the spirit with Prakṛti, as a single undifferen- tiated unit, produces a primal consciousness (Buddhi), which develops under the influence of the individuation (Ahamkara) of the spirit an individual form or psychic apparatus, on which is based the life of the individual. In that case the conception of a cosmic development of individuation and the other things would be in the main a mistaken complement of the system which is not essential to it. But there is the grave objection to this theory that already in the Samkhya Karika the paternal and maternal portions of the gross elements are supposed by the author to fall back into and be picked up out of Prakṛti by the psychic apparatus in the case of death and rebirth, and not as would be logical and proper, if the development of Prakṛti were individual from the point of Buddhi onwards, recalled into and evolved from the subtle clements, while the Prabhūtas, which represent the material world, are made to stand over against the selves as an independent real world. 

It is, however, unnecessary to consider further the contradictions of the Samkhya, and it is only requisite to note that in the nature of Prakṛti there is supposed to be contained a triad of constituent factors, Guņas, literally 'threads' rather than determinant qualities', which in the passive condition of Prakṛti are in a quiescent state of equilibrium, but which in the process of evolution develop differently in the several psychic apparatuses, producing, therefore, the very varied characters of men and of life. These factors are Sattva, the light, the intellectual principle, Rajas, the active and emotional principle, and Tamas, the dark and gloomy principle. The terms are wholly indefinite and unphilosophical, and the use made of them in practice is mainly

psychical, whereas, as constituents of Prakṛti, they ought to have received. some different cosmic sense, such as that of conditional being, energy, and inertia, suggested by Hopkins. Their importance in the system, however, cannot be underestimated, and it is significant that, while Śañkara rejects definitely the validity of these principles, they are accepted by the later school of Vedanta and interwoven with the Vedanta philosophy." 

(c) THE ORIGIN OF THE SAṀKHYA AND BUDDHISM 

The question inevitably arises in what manner these views are to be con- nected with those of the Upanisads,3 and the further problem must be men- tioned of the origin of Buddhism, which has been traced to the Samkhya. The Buddhist system differs in one essential from the Samkhya: it abolishes, as does that system, the principle of an absolute, with which the individual souls are identified, and it goes further than that system in seeking to deny the existence of soul. The latter aberration need not, however, be taken very seriously the Buddhists, being determined believers in transmigration, had to produce an entity which would transmigrate; the entity provided does not differ, in any very essential way, from the ordinary view in India of a transmigrating soul, and certainly is philosophically inferior to the ordinary conception, unsatisfactory as that in itself is. 

4 

No Upanisad attains the point of view of the Sāṁkhya system, and it is therefore only possible to indicate the mode in which the conception of the absolute tended to fade away and to leave the individual spirits confronted with nature. The essential feature of the Samkhya is the evolutionary series, and the name Samkhya, 'examination', 'calculation', or 'description by enumeration of constituents 2,5 rather than a mere counting, suggests that the philosophy owed its importance to its insistence on the principle of careful examination of the clements of the process of development from the absolute. Now in the Upanisads the first case in which the order of evolution from the absolute is stated with precision-even then incomplete is in the Katha Upanisad, where we find that in the carrying out of meditation, Yoga, in order to reach the absolute, the objects are merged in the senses, the senses in the mind, the mind in the intellect, Buddhi, the intellect in the great self,

The alternative view that the Samkhya is of independent origin, based on an independent analysis of consciousness, and that the Katha represents a compromise may be men- tioned (cf. Oltramare, L'histoire des idées théosophiques, i. 221 ff., for a critique of Garbe's view on this point). But it is not possible to ignore the obvious fact that the Purusa of the Samkhya is merely the Atman made many.

which is also then merged in the undiscriminated, Avyakta, described as the calm self, and that again in the spirit, Puruşa, which is the absolute. The similitude of these views to the series of development of the Samkhya is obvious the separation of the Mahan Atmā, the great self, and Buddhi is a distinction which it is difficult to appreciate in the Katha and would naturally disappear on further reflection, with the abandonment of a cosmic Atman, while the interposition of the undiscriminated, which corresponds to the position of the old primitive material or waters of the Brahmanas, between the spirit and the intellect, corresponds also precisely to the position of Prakṛti in the Samkhya system, except for the fact that the Katha is still monistic, and still regards the spirit as an absolute, whence nature is derived, the individual spirit being identified more or less clearly with the highest spirit. But it must have been an obvious, if no less a very important, step when it was decided by some thinker that there was no necessity to imagine the unity of all the spirits in one. Ex hypothesi the spirits were all identical with the one spirit, and, therefore, each must have the same creative power to produce the undiscriminated as the supreme spirit. To what end then to feign a supreme spirit? Moreover, from another point of view the postulating of a supreme spirit would appear unsound: the enormous variety of individual experience of life, the plain facts of every-day existence, show that there is not one spirit merely but many.1 The theory of unity of all spirits is difficult and con- fusing, and the obvious refuge from these difficulties is to admit that each spirit is a separate entity. The relation of the spirits and Prakṛti would follow at once, when this was accepted: the doctrine of Yajñavalkya was clear that the self was merely the knowing subject: clearly, therefore, as the self was the subject only, Prakṛti cannot be produced from the spirit in any material sense it is the independent object merely of spirit.2 

It is important to note the real similarity between the self in the view of the Yajnavalkya of the Bṛhadaraṇyaka Upanisad and that of the Samkhya; both are absolutely without quality or activity, completely inactive, the capacity of knowing without content; both, we may fairly say, represent bare abstractions which could never as such be real. If the self of Yajnavalkya is wholly apart from empirical existence and knowledge, the same thing really applies to the spirit of the Samkhya, for it is not really in contact with matter. In the Buddhism of the Sarvästivādins we find the same view of Vijñāna, which remains wholly apart from real connexion with the object, being, like it, merely a momentary flashing wholly transitory and uncaused. Naturally in all three cases some effort must be made to explain the connexion of this 

1 Cf. Samkhya Kārikā 18.

subjectivity and the object which makes its potentiality concrete knowledge, and equally naturally at this point in all three systems we have a lacuna, which is filled up by unintelligible assertions, the Buddhists resorting to a relation of Sārūpya, 'co-ordination' or 'co-relation', which is found also in the Yogabhāṣya 1 of Vyāsa as the mode of bridging over the gulf between knower and knowledge. 

If we seek to find in the older Upaniṣads a more direct connexion with the doctrines of the Samkhya than the conception of the self in Yājñavalkya, then the most obvious parallel, in addition to the scheme of evolution in the Katha, is the passage in the Kauṣitaki Upanisad 2 in which a list of ten senses is opposed to a corresponding number of objects, and the presence of intellect, Prajñā, is said to be essential for every kind of sense-knowledge, including the activity of mind in respect of thought and desire. We have here the prototype of the curious feature in the Samkhya of the senses and mind as alike only potential until reflected in some manner in Purușa. The more common idea of the senses being powerless without mind lies doubtless at the back of this more advanced conception, a fact which illustrates the remarkable dependence of the Samkhya on older ideas. 

A certain degree of parallelism to the Katha evolution series is present in doctrine of the mode in which on death according to the Chandogya Upanisad speech (the eye, the car, and the other organs are presumably here typified by speech) enters the mind, the mind the breath, the breath the brilliance of fire (the other two elements of the Chandogya, water and earth, may be included), and that the supreme deity. In deep sleep, again, we have a series in the PraŚna Upanisad 3 where we may understand that the five gross, the five subtle, elements, the organs of sense, all enter the mind, it the intellect, it individuation, it thought, it brilliance, it breath, and it the self, but this latter passage is too vague to be of much importance save as showing how prevalent were these efforts to find the order of evolution. 

In the Mundaka Upanisad 5 we find an expression of the order of develop- ment commencing from the absolute, as all-knowing, the second element being food, an expression perhaps for the undiscriminated, the coming breath, which may correspond with Hiranyagarbha, mind, truth, the worlds, and actions. The more precise similarity of the doctrine of the Mundaka to that of the Katha is maintained by Hertel,' who has endeavoured to reconstruct an original text of this Upanisad by conjecture from that which, as he holds, based on a single manuscript which was far from correct, has been preserved

According to Oldenberg (Die Lehre der Upanishaden, p. 226, n. 1) it means "das Ichmachen," d. h. das Ichsagen und Betätigen der Ichheit,' rather than *der Ichmacher'. The genesis of this

entity may be connected with the speculations of the Upanisads on deep sleep, in which individuality disappears; Heimann, Die Tiefschlafspekulation der alten Upanisaden (1922), pp. 13 f. i. 1. 8, 9; ii. 1. 2, 8.

to us by Śankara. Reconstructions of this kind seldom permit of any satis- factory result to others than their author, and there is always the fundamental difficulty, apart from minor points, whether the incoherence of thought which gives rise to the reconstruction is not, as most probably in the case of the Bhagavadgītā, due to the author, and not the result of interpolation. If, however, we omit the whole of ii. 2, and iii. 1. 4-10 and 2. 8 and 9, we obtain the doctrine that, as in the Skambha hymn of the Atharvaveda,1 which affords part of the material of the Upanisad, the highest thing in the world is regarded as personal, from which there emanates the Brahman and whatever else exists. On this view the ultimate fate of the soul on its return is not absorp- tion in the Brahman but union with Purusa, the world of Brahman serving merely as the place of those who fully perform the sacrificial ritual in the mode approved by the Mundaka. The other portions, however, of the text, which cannot with any assurance be ascribed to working over, definitely identify the highest principle with the Brahman, adopting the regular identification of the Brahman and the Atman, and treating the final result to be aimed at as the recognition of the identity of the Brahman and the Atman. Moreover, even in the verses which are spared by Hertel, we find hints contradicting his theory of a simple doctrine; thus in i. 1. 7 all is stated to arise from the imperishable (akṣara), while in ii. 1. 2 we find the personal highest being declared to be above the imperishable, and in ii. 1. 10 the Brahman and Puruşa are directly identified, unless we hold with Hertel that there is a lacuna in the text for which we have no other ground. It is significant also that the interpolator has to be credited with iii. 2. 3, which adopts the Katha doctrine of salvation by the favour of the lord, so that we have to assume that, on the one hand, he altered the personal aspect of the Upanisad by insisting on the primacy of the impersonal Brahman, while, on the other, he deliberately added one of the most personal touches in the shape of the doctrine of grace. This is plainly incredible, and we may safely assume that, while the author worked on an older idea of a personal prius as in the Atharvaveda, and accepted the doctrine of grace from the Katha, he himself adopted the Brahman standpoint.3 The resemblance of the Maitrāyaṇīya Upaniṣad to the Samkhya is of a

To certain of Hertel's metrical views the strongest exception must be taken. To carry out his rule that the first syllable of a dissyllabic, and the second of a trisyllabic, middle part of the Triṣṭubh is short he has to argue for oṣadhyaḥ, purăstäd, paramaṁ (sāmyam) as two shorts, suriasya, kavayo yanti, and agràhyam; he turns -āni and -eşu into single final syllables, and postulates a great number of quite impossible elisions of short vowels. These, added 

to text alterations, enable him to reform the metre, but they do not justify his severe censure of Deussen for his perfectly just strictures on the metre of the text as we have it. Every metrical irregularity could thus be removed from any text, and Hertel's procedure is specially inconsistent, since he objects to alteration of Prakritic irregularities in grammar, which might equally well be changed, if the Upanisad is to be rewritten. But metre may be excused in a philosopher. Cf. E. A. Welden, AJP. xxxv. 32 ff.

different character from that of the Katha; it is due in all likelihood to direct Samkhya influence at a much later date. In this Upanisad we find an answer attempted to the question why and how the absolute self enters the world and appears in individual form. Prajapati, existing alone, had no joy; therefore he created offspring as inanimate, and to enjoy them he enters with the breaths into them, thus animating them, and then by means of the organs of sense and action and the mind he has joy of them. But the absolute self, Prajapati, remains wholly unaffected, though an apparent actor; action actually belongs to the Bhūtātman, or clemental soul, which overcome by the fruits of action passes to a good or evil birth, and is merged in existence, while the true self remains unaffected like the drop of water on a lotus leaf. The clemental soul is overcome by the qualities or factors of nature, Prakṛti, and thus conceives the erroneous impression of individuality; thinking This is I' and 'That is mine' he binds himself as a bird with a snare.1 But the pure self is not without responsibility for this evil state, for a definite though obscure statement attributes it to the fact that the elemental self is overpowered by the inner Purusa. The composite character of the text reveals itself in the further con- ception of the self as the enjoyer, while the elemental soul is made out to be the body, which it enjoys. We find also the three factors named and described at length, essentially as psychic, and Prajapati as affected by Sattva, goodness, as a factor is equated with Visņu, as affected by Rajas, activity, with Brahman, and as affected with Tamas, dullness, with Rudra. It is characteristic that the Upanisad shows equally knowledge of the development of Yoga doctrine, though its scheme of stages of exercises has six in lieu of the classical cight." Further, it is markedly pessimistic, the evils of empirical existence being set out with an elaboration of comparison and detail such as is only to be paralleled in the Buddhist texts, which it doubtless knew in some early form. It shows an advanced psychology, for it recognizes the function of individuation, though not as in the Samkhya in its classical form, as placed between intellect and mind and as the source of the latter, but as following on mind and intellect, without any assertion of derivation, and it conceives of the existence of the subtle body, or Linga, though it is not clear whether it actually asserts that the Linga possesses not merely the fine elements but also the gross elements as part of its composition.5 Moreover, the question is actually posed whether it is merely the factors that are really subject to bondage, or the self; the classical Samkhya asserts definitely, though not always consistently, that the self is not really bound, but this is not the view accepted by the Upanisad, which insists on the bondage of the self, exhibited in the actions of intellect, mind, and individuation, and promises release when the sense organs, mind, and intellect have ceased to function."

The Philosophy of the Veda 

[Part V 

For the doctrine of the Gunas or factors there is obvious a parallel in the CvetaŚvatara Upanisad,1 which has on the ground of its content often been needlessly supposed to postdate the Samkhya system, a view which cannot be supported on any cogent ground. In it, we are told, that one she-goat, red, white, and black in hue, produces many young like herself: one he-goat leaps on her in love, the other abandons her, after associating with her. The idea of the relation of nature to the many spirits seems obviously expressed in this metaphor. But it is clear that the red, white, and black colours carry us beyond doubt to the Chandogya Upanisad, where everything in the universe is declared to be connected with the three elements, the red of fire, the white of water, and the black of food, probably an allusion to earth, this being the order of creation when the absolute first produced heat, thence water, then earth, in the shape of food. It is not necessary to suppose that in the ŚvetäŚvatara there is anything more meant than the three elements: the transformation of these to psychic forces, which is prominent in the Saṁkhya, though the other conception is implied in the ascription of the three to Prakṛti, would then be a later development, which in the Upanisads occurs first in the Maitrāyaṇīya.1 

It is clear, therefore, that the seeds of the Samkhya lie in the philosophy of the Upanisads: the conception of the deliverance from the round of rebirth and misery is wholly absurd on the Samkhya theory of the universe, which denies any real connexion of spirit and nature, and, therefore, makes any suffering impossible, since without connexion there is no illumination, and without illumination of nature by spirit no suffering of any kind. In the doctrine of Maya there is an illusion which is perfectly real though an illusion, and knowledge can dispel it and its products. But the ignorance which must be dispelled in the Samkhya is the belief in a connexion which does not exist, and the Samkhya philosophy never suggests that the misery of the universe is due to the belief: it is only possible because of the connexion: ignorance does not produce the connexion: therefore logically there is no misery. The mere fact of this illogicality alone and the marked pessimism of the system would testify to its derivative character. 

6 

A somewhat divergent view of the development of the Samkhya is suggested by Dahlmann, who in several works has insisted on the view that 

iii. 5; v. 2. 

1 iv. 5. 

2 Hopkins (JAOS. xxii. 380-7) insists that sāmkhyayogādhigumyam in vi. 13 must refer to the system of the epic Samkhya- Yoga, but this is not in the least proved; see Deussen, Gesch. der Phil. I. iii. 15. Morcover it is difficult to reconcile Hopkins' view with his date of the 4th cent. (ibid. p. 336) for this Upanisad. Kapila in v. 2 is clearly mythical (cf. iv. 12), not the teacher. 

3 vi. 4. 

This leads Speyer (Indische Theosophie, p. 113) to the conjecture that an originally materialistic system has been trans- formed in an external method idealis- tically. But this theory rests on no solid basis and ignores the essential link of connexion with the Upaniṣads. So with Jacobi, Festschrift Kuhn, pp. 37 ff., and Berndl, Über das Samkhya. For a later view of Jacobi, see below. 

• Das Mahābhārata als Epos und Rechtsbuch;Chap. 28] 

The Origin of the Samkhya 

541 

the epic reveals to us the oldest stage of the Samkhya philosophy and not as maintained by Hopkins,1 and in some degree 2 Deussen among others, an eclectic philosophical view. Dahlmann's position is obscured by its connexion with his ingenious but unsuccessful effort to prove that the epic is in itself a unity consciously produced at a period before Panini, a thesis which rests on absolutely no cogent or even plausible evidence. Nor have we any tolerable ground for the view that the system of Samkhya as first evolved under that name was other than atheistic, in the sense not merely of denying an İŚvara which in a degree Dahlmann would admit, but also of denying an absolute. Further, it is most natural to hold that the Samkhya-Yoga of the epic is a definite theistic modification of the Samkhya, which is more really theistic and absolutist than the later Yoga, in which as a system attention is directed towards the Yoga practices and not so largely to the theistic aspect. But the rejection of Dahlmann's theories in these respects does not deprive of value his theory of the development of Indian philosophy. He argues that the first stage must be looked for in a view which is in close touch with the expres- sions of the Brāhmaṇas as to the process of creation, in which there is more or less consciously assumed to be some material beyond the actual creator, and he points out that in the early speculations of the Upanisads we learn of the Atman on the one hand, but also of what is not the Atman, which is full of misery. In more philosophic form this appears as the doctrine of the Brahman, beside which stands Prakṛti, into which is emptied the whole of the ordinary world of thought and action, while the Brahman remains outside all contact with thought, affording the end, Nirvana, which is to be attained by the extinguishing of all kinds of feeling, by the negation of everything empirical. From this dualistic basis he deduces on the one hand the Samkhya and on the other the Vedanta of the illusionist school. The former view is arrived at by a determined effort to make logical the process of development in final release it became intolerable to contemplate that there was really only one Atman, which, by connexion in some unexplained way with Prakṛti, produced the innumerable separate spirits through the action of Buddhi and of Aham- kāra, since release became meaningless, and it, therefore, assumed that there were innumerable Atmans, whose derivation from the primitive Atman was proved by the fact that they retained the characteristics of omnipresence and infinity, which belong properly only to the one Atman and which, applied to all, lead to absurdity. On the other hand, the Vedantins laid such stress on the unity of the universe that they denied the existence as real of Prakṛti, contenting themselves with the idle doctrine of illusion, which was clearly inconsistent with their own principle of unity. Moreover, he argues, materialism was a natural product of the carly view, since it really emptied

the Atman of all empirical reality, and gave such reality to Prakṛti, and thus encouraged the view that matter by itself was able to produce the universe, while on the other hand by its subjectivism in the doctrine of the Atman encouragement was given to scepticism, and finally to the philosophic in- difference of carly Buddhism. 

Apart from the fact that there is really no good ground for calling the first stage Samkhya,1 and that the denial of illusionism cannot be accepted as absolutely true of the Upanisads, Dahlmann's theory has the merit of directing attention to a real aspect of the philosophy of the Upanisads and the epic : there is a real affinity between the process by which Buddhi and Ahamkāra are deemed to produce the world of experience and the older myths of Prajā- pati and his desire, Kama, as playing their parts in the creation of the world, while still further back we have the picture of Puruşa as at once the material and the spiritual source of the world. But it would be a mistake to accept the view that the aspect insisted upon by Dahlmann was really either the sole aspect or the chief aspect of philosophy in the period of the later Upanisads. In particular Dahlman goes clearly too far in stressing the independent character of the evolution of Prakṛti, and in his insistence on the nature of IŚvara as the world soul arising from Prakṛti alone, thus placing Prakṛti beside the Atman as in itself accounting for the whole of the empirical world. It must never be forgotten, as Dahlmann himself elsewhere 2 recognizes, that the spiritual side of existence is essentially conditioned by the fact that in Prakṛti the Atman is present as the observer, a fact which in the Samkhya is preserved and emphasized in the insistence on the doctrine that but for the connexion of Puruşa and Prakṛti there would be no cognition or feeling of any kind. When due weight is accorded to this fact, we reach fairly closely to a concep- tion which is not far different from that of Badarayana as the normal, not unique, doctrine of the Upanisads: there is an absolute on which matter is dependent indeed, but not illusory, and individual souls which in the Upani- şads, but not in the Brahma Sutra, at the end are resolved into the absolute, but which are not in themselves illusory, being, we may assume, the necessary result of the coexistence of the absolute and matter, and therefore endowed, until united with the absolute through knowledge, with a certain relative but real independence.3 

The real question is in a sense whether we can legitimately call Samkhya a system which accepts an absolute, and differs from the normal Upanisad doctrine essentially in the attention given to derivation from the absolute of Prakrti and individuals. The best defence of this suggestion is that of Olden- berg, who faces the fundamental difficulty that a system with an absolute in

the epic is not normally Samkhya, and that the twenty-five principles of the Samkhya of the epic seem in their correspondence with the classical school to negate the presence among them of the absolute. Oldenberg's suggestion, that the twenty-fifth principle includes both the absolute and its manifesta- tions as individual, is ingenious, but hardly convincing, and as a matter of terminology and historic fact it seems unwise to employ the term Sāṁkhya as applicable to any system which acknowledges an absolute. The facts of the derivation of the Samkhya above accepted are, of course, not affected by the question of terminology, and in view of the extremely composite nature of epic philosophy we need not be in the least surprised to find a conglomerate of this side of Aupaniṣada views with genuine Samkhya, and the blend which the epic knows as Samkhya-Yoga, and which has the somewhat unfortunate appearance of an effort to reconcile the Upanisads and the Samkhya. 

An interesting and ingenious effort, however, has been made by Professor Edgerton1 to establish the doctrine that the epic knows nothing of a Samkhya which denies the world soul or an IŚvara, and that in it Samkhya and Yoga do not denote philosophical systems but means of realizing that unity with the world soul, which is the aim of all philosophy in this period which is not materialistic. Samkhya denotes simply reflection-doubtless its primary meaning and Yoga practical exercises tending to produce the unity desired, the details in the Mokṣadharma showing that a sort of self-hypnosis is aimed at, while in the Gita the method is that of unselfish normal activity in the position of life in which fate has placed a man. Ingenious as this effort is, the denial of a specific Samkhya doctrine appears, on the whole, untenable. It compels us in the passage xii. 11037 ff. to render the words aniŚvaraḥ katham mucyet as 'how the soul may be saved', and to hold that in this passage no distinction is being drawn between the views of Samkhya and Yoga, which is to put an intolerable strain upon the language.2 Nor does it seem possible in xii. 11408 to render aniŚvaram applied to the twenty-fifth principle merely as supreme'; the term iŚvara in the preceding verse makes it clear that a contrast is intended. Another reference to the distinctive Samkhya insistence on a multitude of spirits must be seen in xii. 11488,4 and the whole matter appears clearly from xii. 13713 ff. In this passage we find two very distinct views set out the Samkhya and the Yoga accept a multiplicity of souls, while Vyasa insists that all the souls at bottom rest on the world soul. To endeavour 5 to explain away this obvious distinction by the theory that the real distinction is between a full and a brief exposition, and not between the views of Kapila and others and of Vyāsa, is as unsatisfactory as the suggestion that adhyātma in the description of Kapila's activities means that he took thought on the supreme soul; the reference is clearly to the soul only. Nor is there anything

out of place1 in the allusion to the Yoga, for on the score of the multiplicity of souls Samkhya and Yoga in their classical forms agree. The effort also to remove the significance of the addition of a twenty-sixth principle in the Yoga on the score that, as Oldenberg suggested, the new head serves merely to distinguish the souls as released, is clearly a tour de force; the twenty-sixth is IŚvara, with whom, indeed, the enlightened soul may be identified.3

In the very different view of Berndl the Sāṁkhya system, as we have it in the Kārikā of IŚvarakṛṣṇa and later, is a serious deviation from the true views of Kapila, who may have been the first teacher to express his views in prose. The original doctrine which denied any soul has been recast to meet Brahman prejudices, and has thus lost its definite character. Traces of the older view may be found in the assertion of the Mahabharata 5 which gives number and matter, Prakṛti, and twenty-four principles as the essence of the Samkhya. Originally the doctrine recognized only three Gunas, Charactere', whose interactions, themselves uncaused, since cause does not affect these things in themselves, produce the whole empirical world, which is ruled by absolute necessity. The Gunas are not material, but are capable of mutual attraction, repulsion, and experience, and their interaction results in the formation of complexes (Empfindungszentren), which are selves, but which true knowledge shows are not distinct, eternal, metaphysical entities. But each is conscious of its essential relation to the Gunas, and this is expressed, subjectively, in the consciousness of transcendence, and, objectively, in the will to live and to maintain one's individuality. Space is an abstraction made by the subject from the relations of things inter se and to itself, to which there corresponds only a manifold of heterogeneous sensations of quality, which the subject, by reason of the difference from its own homogeneity, experiences as something without. Time is also an abstraction made by the subject, to which alterations of external and internal conditions correspond, the ground for distinguishing them being their different characters, those without being many and cutting across one another, while those which are internal are individualized and unified. The suggestion is ingenious, but it is perfectly clear that it is unhistorical. To eliminate Purusas as an essential feature opposed to Prakṛti is to contradict everything we know of the Samkhya, and it is difficult to appreciate why the system should thus have been transformed, nor do the changes in the system of Empedokles made by Anaxagoras provide

79 ff.). 

The latter invented nous because the fact that the elements of Empedokles were conscious was forgotten, in Berndl's view. The view of Kapila was similarly altered, but illogically many selves were admitted, to avoid adopting the Vedanta view. But, while Anaxagoras was a pioneer as to nous, Kapila was a rebel against the Brahman soul doc- trine, which ruins the alleged parallel. 

Chap. 28]

an adequate parallel. It is necessary also in Berndl's view to deny the doctrine of necessary periodical destruction of the universe, since all that is requisite is that, since things have originated, they cannot be permanent, and to question the early character of the marked pessimism of the Kārikā as incon- sistent with the date of 700 or 800 B.C. ascribed to Kapila. 

A different view of the relation of the Upanisads and the Samkhya is presented by Professor Jacobi,' whose latest view is that a distinct gulf lies between the older Upanisads, and the middle and younger groups, terms which denote the Kaṭha, IŚa, ŚvetāŚvatara, Mundaka and Mahānārāyaṇa, and the PraŚna, Maitrāyaṇīya, and Maṇḍükya respectively. 

The middle group is 

marked out from the oldest group by the absence of Aranyaka characteristics, the fact that the thought of the Upanisads is no longer in the making but already expresses itself in characteristic verses and turns of phrase, and the metrical form, while, as Jacobi points out, there appears in the middle and younger groups a large number of technical terms of philosophical interest which are unknown to the earlier texts. In Jacobi's view there is also a vital philosophical difference between the two strata; the middle and younger Upanisads are composed under the direct influence of the Samkhya system which had come into being after the oldest Upanisads. The vital element in the new point of view is the manifestation of the belief in the doctrine of the personal immortality of the souls of men and other creatures conceived as monads or as a multiplicity of immaterial substances, this view being accom- panied by the clear distinction of what was material and what was immaterial. The souls of the Samkhya are derived, in his view, from the aspect of the self as composed of intelligence or consciousness (vijñānamaya) in the older Upanisads, but with the essential difference that the soul is no longer regarded as being derived from and merging on death into the Brahman. At the same time the being (sat) of the Chandogya Upanisad 2 with its three constituents, which in the Upanisad are regarded as living, is distinguished as purely material, and its constituents figure as the Gunas of the Samkhya, while the Buddhi of the Samkhya is a transformation of the vijñānaghana ātmā of Yajnavalkya, the whole somewhat bizarre conception being due to an effort at an early date to make a coherent system out of the confused thoughts of the oldest Upani- şads. This system was of influence, though it did not prove generally accept- able. The middle and younger Upanisad groups represent efforts to compro- mise between the Samkhya with its kindred Yoga, and the pantheistic spirit of the Upanisads, an effort continued in the Bhagavadgita and the philosophical parts of the Mahabharata, and finally resulting in the compro- mise of the Purāņas. One doctrine, however, that of the personal immortality of the soul, became generally accepted, figuring in the Nyaya and VaiŚeṣika schools, the Vedanta of Badarāyaṇa, and even the Purva Mīmānsā, as well

as in Jainism. In the latter case the conception both of soul and matter seems to have been developed contemporaneously with the Samkhya views, though it is probable that the idea of the soul as essentially pure intelligence and immortal was taken over by the Jains from some other doctrine, much of primitive hylozoism clinging to their view of the soul. 

C 

This view has been accepted as regards the origin of the theory of soul by Prof. Stcherbatsky,1 who holds that the fact that the theory was few was the ground why it was so bitterly assailed by the Buddhists. He admits that the idea of a surviving personality is not unknown in the Veda, and that its essence and its relation to the Brahman are the main topic of discussion in the Upanisads. But this self is a psychological entity, different explanations of its nature are proposed, and materialistic views are not excluded.2 The idea of an immortal soul in our sense, a spiritual monad, a simple, uncomposite, eternal, immaterial substance is quite unknown in the Veda inclusive of the older Upanisads.' Most regrettably neither Prof. Jacobi nor Prof. Stcher- batsky has pointed out the passages in the middle or younger Upanisads in which this new idea of an immortal soul is to be found, as contrasted with those in the older Upanisads; and it appears to me wholly impossible to find any such distinction as real. The idea that at this period in the history of Indian thought the conception of an immortal soul was first introduced appears wholly without warrant, and to misunderstand entirely the course of development of Indian philosophy. 

The fact, of course, is that the primitive Vedic belief clung to the doctrine of the survival of something after death, and that, therefore, immortality was no new idea. The view as to what survived was as hazy as it is to-day in popular and philosophic thought alike, for then, as now, it was practically impossible to form any intelligible conception of what a soul is, for such a description of the modern view as that given by Prof. Stcherbatsky cannot be said to have any intelligible meaning. But superinduced on this simple view we have the philosophic doctrine passed off under the name of Yajnavalkya, which asserts that the soul is not, as the ordinary man thinks, independent; it is only a part of a greater whole or more accurately an aspect of that whole, so that at death there is no separate existence in the sense of personal im- mortality. That this view was ever generally accepted in philosophic circles is not suggested in the older Upanisads, and the middle and younger Upanisads show that it was not attractive and that the tendency was to consider the matter more theistically, the absolute taking on a definitely personal appear- ance and less stress being laid on merger in it, though it is essential to note that merger remains as a doctrine alongside with the contemplation of continued existence. But there is not the slightest trace of the advent of 

The Central Conception of Buddhism (1923), 

pp. 69 ff. 

That such views are allowed in the older Upanisads seems an error, perhaps 

based on Jacobi's older suggestion of materialism in CU. vi, which seems tacitly revised in op. cit., pp. 11 f. 

Chap. 28] The Origin of the Samkhya and Buddhism

personal immortality or the spiritual nature of the soul as new ideas in the period of the middle Upanisads; the soul there remains a psychological entity exactly to the same extent as it was such an entity in the older Upanisads. 

Prof. Stcherbatsky, however, maintains that the old and the new soul theories were clearly distinguished; thus all Buddhists rejected the doctrine of a self corresponding to the psycho-physical individual, Atmavāda, but the Vātsiputriyas and Sammitiyas accepted the theory of the doctrine of per- manent soul, Pudgalavada. This basis of distinction, however, is clearly illegitimate, and is not given by the Buddhist texts; instead the Pudgala is clearly a self corresponding to the psycho-physical individual, since it is main- tained that it assumes new elements at birth and throws them off at death,1 and the other Buddhist schools justly rejected either doctrine, seeing through the subterfuge by which these two schools endeavoured, while evading direct contradiction of the master's insistence on Anatta, negation of a self, to preserve the existence of something which could transmigrate, thus preserving the reality of the doctrine of moral retribution, which utterly disappears in the ordinary conception of Buddhism.2 Nor is there any plausibility in the view that the Kaṭha Upanisad already recognizes what Prof. Stcherbatsky- on dubious grounds-claims to be the fundamental doctrine of Buddhism, the existence of Dharmas conceived as a plurality of subtle, ultimate, not further analysable elements of matter, mind, and force. The theory is based on the fact that in that Upanisad (iv. 14) we find a condemnation of him who sees Dharmas separately (prthag dharmān paŚyati), which is a very different thing from Stcherbatsky's rendering 'maintains the existence of separate elements'. The idea that Dharmas in this passage are 'elements' is as implausible as that the term Dharma in i. 21 has this sense; the word seems to mean in both instances something like thing' as taken by Geiger,3 and this use harmonizes with dharmya as opposed to what is subtle (anu) in ii. 13, a passage ignored by Stcherbatsky. With this rendering disappears wholly the idea that the author of the Katha is directing a polemic against a doctrine which denies both the old and the new theorics of the soul, or that Dharma is a catchword referring to a new and foreign doctrine, some anatma-dharma theory'. Nor is there the slightest justification for the view that Panini is aware of Buddhist and Samkhya views of causation, for his explanation of the use

Pāṇini's knowledge would be increased if we accepted Charpentier's claim (ZII. ii. 140 ff.) that he lived not later than 550 B.C., since he knew the title of Kamboja King, which was extinct after the death of Kambyses (= Kam- boja King, title of older Achaime- nidai). But this rests on a number of conjectures, all unproved and all most implausible. 

548 

The Philosophy of the Veda 

[Part V 

of samskṛta and upakṛta or upaskṛta corresponds very poorly with this suggestion. 

Stcherbatsky 1 suggests further that from the Samkhya the Buddhists derived the incentive to the doctrine of the world as consisting of momentary elements of mind, matter, and force. The Guņas of the Samkhya on this view are interpreted as fundamental principles, matter, mind-stuff, and energy- stuff, acting as interdependent moments in every real and substantial exist- ence; the infinitesimals of energy, present everywhere, are semi-material; although different from the inertia of matter and the luminosity of mind, they are separate and substantial'. The Buddhist elements arc a reply to the Samkhya by an architect of greater skill. Ingenious as this theory is, it depends, even if we accept the suggested view of the Buddhist Dharmas as primitive-which seems impossible on the belief that the interpretation of the Gunas adopted is really that of the early Samkhya. This seems frankly impossible in view of the silence of the Samkhya texts and of the epic alike. The interpretation is based on the Yogabhaṣya of Vyasa, who is a compara- tively late author, and who shows every sign of influence by the Buddhist schools. To substitute his views for those of the origin of the Samkhya is as unwise as to adopt the doctrines of the Sarvästivādins, as expounded by Vasu- bandhu, as representing the early doctrines of Buddhism from a philosophical point of view. The same error marks the suggestion that the name of Samkhya is borrowed from Samkhya in the sense of Prajña, that intellectual insight which destroys the infections (kleŚas), through which the spirit is bound to con- tinued existence. There can be no question that the epic explanation of the term as Parisamkhyāna, enumeration (of principles)', is to be preferred to this suggestion, though it is still more probable that in its earliest stage the term simply referred to reasoning.

It itself denotes the exertion which results in hypnosis, praxis as opposed to theory, but it assumes other shades of meaning, including the restraint of the senses (cf. Güntert, Der arische Weltkönig, p. 225) and the joining of the spirit to that of IŚvara or an absolute. Cf. Keith, Samkhya System, chap. iv.

as a discipline by which the mind can be withdrawn from the things of this world and unity with the absolute can be attained, although it is only in the Katha, the CvetaŚvatara, and the much later Maitrāyaṇiya that these traces are of importance. The CvetaŚvatara, however, contributes an element which in the classical Yoga distinguishes it from the Samkhya, the presence of a personal deity, though the figure of the god in the Upanisad is infinitely more vivid and important than that of the IŚvara of the Yoga. This Upanisad, however, is distinctly marked by lack of clearness of conception, and attempts at harmonization of contrasting views. Recognizing the strength of the popular religion which craved for aid from the gods, and in no wise satisfied with mere Yoga methods of securing the end desired, the CvetäŚvatara intro- duces into its system the conception of god. But in this introduction we find a repeated confusion between god as an addition to the empiric universe beside matter and spirits, and god as identical with the absolute. In the first sense we have the conception of the absolute as comprehending the three; god, who is the knower, the inciter to enjoyment, the lord; spirit, the enjoyer, the ignorant, not the lord; and nature, which is to be enjoyed by each spirit according to its merit or demerit. Two birds there are dwelling in one tree, one eats the sweet fruit, the other merely gazes on the scene; one, spirit, is dis- tressed in contact with nature, but when it beholds the other, the lord, is freed from its woes. In the classical Yoga this picture presents itself in the form of a god who is a special spirit untouched by the impurity of the world, by action and its fruits, and who promotes the freedom of unemancipated spirits. The objections to the later view are obvious; how can there exist a god, who is not removed from all connexion with the world as is the released spirit, and yet is untouched by the misery of the world? In the Upanisad, however, god has a much more real existence; he is hailed as Rudra 2 and begged to spare the votary; he is invoked with the names of MahcŚvara, Hara, and Śiva, and he is identified at times with the Brahman, which, though also set above Rudra, is immediately after 3 expressly given the name of Lord, IŚa, which is essentially that of Rudra. The end of man is to know, to see mystically this god, who is the magician who creates the universe in which the soul by illusion (māyā) is bound. He is the maker of all, all-knower, self-sourced, intelligent, the author of time, yet above the three times and impartite, possession of quali- ties, omniscient, the ruler of matter (pradhāna), and of the spirit, lord of qualities, the cause of transmigration and of liberation, of continuance and of bondage. When men shall roll up space as if it were a piece of leather, then only will there be an end of evil apart from the knowledge of god."

god,1 a doctrine which suggests not the later Yoga, but the spirit of the Bhagavadgita and the general adoration of the teacher, as an essential part of the way of salvation, in the sectarian religions. 

2 

The early Upanisads contain no clear trace of the doctrine which is later found in the Buddhism of the Sarvästivādins, and which discriminates between the power of knowledge to remove causes of existence and that of ecstasy, assigning to the latter alone the power of suppressing all material elements and all sensuous consciousness, knowledge dealing with mental clements and mental consciousness. Such a distinction has every appearance of being an excrescence on the original Buddhist doctrine, evoked by the desire to find a logical place for ecstasy as opposed to mere knowledge, but it may have been early in appearing. 

6 

Slight as is normally the recognition in the Buddhist texts of the Brahman doctrine of their rivals, Geiger 3 has shown that the term Dhamma not rarely is used as a substitute, in expressing the Buddhist ideal, for the Brahman of the Upanisads, while the term Brahman itself is occasionally preserved." The famous phrase Wheel of the Law (dhamma-cakka)' is also paralleled by Brahma-cakka; 5 the Dhammayana by Brahmayana; the Tathāgata is not merely an incorporation of Dhamma but also of the Brahman, he has become not only the Dhamma but also the Brahman; the Dhamma even claims the worship which is the lot of the Brahman in the Upanisads." 

9 

7 

6 

Nor in choosing the term Dhamma for the system was Buddhism without Upani- şad precedent; the Bṛhadaranyaka tells that Brahman created the Dharma, than which nothing is higher, and the Mahānārāyana 10 asserts that the whole universe is encircled by the Dharma, than which there is nothing harder to describe. 

While it is, as has been seen, impossible to accept the derivation of the Samkhya from a materialism, it is probable that its realistic elements were partly due to a contemporary tendency in this direction of which, not un- naturally, we have no direct carly evidence. The CvetaŚvatara Upaniṣad, however, records 11 possible or actual theories of the absolute or final principle (brahman),12 which include necessity (niyati), chance (yadṛccha), time, inherent nature (svabhāva), matter (bhūtāni), and spirit. In the records of Buddhism 18 we have given to us as existing contemporaneously with the Buddha the doctrine of Ajita Kesakambalin, who was in effect a materialist, and who, according to the Jain tradition,14 believed, as did the Cārvākas of the later tradition, in pleasure as the one end to be followed.

doctrine 1 certainly suggest that it was based on some degree at least on the principle enunciated by Yajñavalkya,2 that on dissolution of the body there exists in certain cases no consciousness, which, if the belief in the existence of the Brahman be removed, would result in a pure materialism, regarding the body as the reality of which life is a mere accompaniment, a view attributed also in Buddhist tradition to the king Payasi, who experimentally established that soul did not survive bodily death. The records are important, since they show that the renunciation of belief in the Brahman could produce materialism as well as the Samkhya dualism and the negation of soul in Buddhism. 

The other principles enumerated by the CvetaŚvatara as possible theories are less important. Necessity figures also in the system of Makkhali Gosāla, while inherent nature appears also as an aspect of that system; 4 time has Vedic authority and persisted much later; chance is rather an element in a system than an actual system, while the brevity of the allusion renders it obscure what particular doctrine is referred to.

## 08. The Supreme and the Individual Souls 

In the philosophy of Yajñavalkya the identity of the supreme and the individual souls is carried to the extreme extent, but at the same time the term soul is deprived of any distinct meaning. The identity of the soul of man and the absolute is due to the mere fact that, by reducing the soul to nothing save what may be termed the mere abstraction of subjectivity, or of the transcendental unity of apperception, the soul becomes nothing but an aspect of a process. It is perfectly legitimate then to identify the supreme and the individual souls, but we are really carried no further by this than the occasional remarks of the Bṛhadaranyaka Upaniṣad, which regards the universe as made up of nothing except subject and object. It is in fact perfectly true that all the world can be regarded as distinguished as subject and object, but, unless we are able to show that this is the sum total of all that we can know, it is clearly impossible for philosophy to stop there. The actual existing world of thought, emotion, and action requires explanation and investigation. In the Vedanta the matter is solved comfortably by the doctrine of the two forms of knowledge: on the upper stage the identity of the self and the absolute is recognized, on the lower there is found to be a personal deity, Hiranyagarbha, and personal selves, who are indeed the absolute self, but fall under the influence of conditioning facts, the Upadhis, mind, the

senses, the vital airs, and the body, which, while in reality no more affecting the reality of the nature of the absolute than the red colour the rock crystal, nevertheless convert it into the self or soul, Jiva,' of everyday humanity. In the Upanisads we naturally expect to find both sides of this doctrine, and we do find them in point of fact quite clearly expressed. On the one hand, we have the constant efforts to show that there is but one self, that there is no multiplicity and no change, which is pure idealism of a very intransigeant type, and on the other the reality of the individual self is constantly insisted upon. It is, however, constantly repeated that the individual and the absolute self are the same, and this is true no less in those cases where we may accept the view that idealism of the Yajnavalkya type is present, than in those, in which there is mere pantheism or cosmogonism. In the latter cases equally there is no ground to distinguish ultimately between the selves, since at the most the individual is merely the absolute in another form. But even when the Upanisads are theistic in spirit, like the Katha and still more decidedly by far the ŚvetaŚvatara, they never reach the view that the supreme and the individual souls are anything really different. The Katha, however, is marked by its clear enunciation for the first time of the conception of the enjoyer as the union of the self with mind and the senses. It also describes the two aspects of the souls as light and shadow, while in the CvetaŚvatara we find the metaphor of the two birds on a tree, one eating the sweet berries, the other merely gazing downwards, without eating. It also develops the idea of the individual soul, as endowed with the faculty of framing concepts and resolves, individualism and intellect, as enjoying the fruit of action, ast small as a thumb in height, or a needle's point, or the ten-thousandth part of the tip of a hair, which is yet identical with the infinitely great supreme soul, a statement which is clearly identical in essence with the Vedanta position as seen in Śankara.

The cause of the appearance in this restricted form of the supreme soul is given by Śankara as the effect of ignorance, and with him that explanation ends the matter, since it is impossible to go further than this. In the Upanisads, apart from the many creation legends which yield no philosophic result, the actual nature of the problem is rarely expressed and very slightly explained. The view of the PraŚna 4 is that breath is born from the self, and it is likened to the shadow on a man. Unhappily the rest of its explanation is obscure if rendered according to grammar, it distinctly says that the position is involuntary (manokṛta) on the part of the self: the version of Sāyaṇa, which is defiant of grammar, takes it that the result is produced by the previous acts of the will of the man in question; it is possible that we must amend so as merely to say that the mind attaches itself to the breath, but this suggestion of Böhtlingk's 5 is doubtful, and the best plan seems to be

to recognize that the process is not voluntary, which is in agreement with the Vedanta view. In the Maitrāyaṇīya,1 which is influenced by the Samkhya views of the constituents of nature, the doctrine is laid down that the self is overcome by the Gunas, and falls into an illusion in which it becomes weak, disordered, sensual, and believes in the separate existence of the self, fettering itself by its own action like a bird by its nest, while an addition 2 to that text gives the different conception, that the supreme soul becomes individual, in order to experience life in the world as well as eternal verity. 

The description of the parts of the individual souls in the Upanisads is far from uniform or homogeneous. In the Samkhya, as we have seen, it is a union of the individual spirit with the elements of intellect, individuation, mind, the five organs of intelligence and the five organs of action, and the subtle elements as well as the fine parts of the gross elements. In the Vedanta the position is not essentially different: the soul is the absolute enveloped in the Upadhis in this case they are mind, the ten senses, the five breaths, which are the organs of nutrition, and the subtle body, that is the subtle parts of the elements which form the seeds of the body. In both cases there must be added the psychic disposition which causes the kind of rebirth and secures that rebirth, the Bhāva of the Samkhya, the Karman of Śankara. 

In the Upanisads the terminology centres mainly in the word Prāṇa, which every now and then, as we have seen, is treated as a synonym of the absolute, but which on the whole is more normally of less consequence. The Prāņa often represents the senses, but the numbers of Prāņas, into which it is divided, differ greatly: the origin of the various calculations may certainly be traced in part at least to the Atharvaveda, where we are told of the head as a drinking bowl with seven seers in the apertures: the sense ascribed to the seven appears to have been the eyes, ears, nostrils, and the organ of taste, for the Bṛhadaraṇyaka Upaniṣad adds to the seven an eighth in the form of speech. The Upanisads normally enumerate a series of five, breath, eyc, ear, mind, and speech, but these are sometimes reduced to four or less; thus the Jaiminiya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa repeatedly dwells on the series, speech, mind, sight, hearing, and the breath or breaths; the cosmic parallels are fire, moon, sun, the quarters (i. e. space), and wind. A different. view is that of a passage of the Bṛhadaranyaka Upanisad,' where the organs

of smell, speech, tongue, eye, ear, mind, hands, and skin are enumerated as the eight Grahas, and the corresponding objects, odour, name, taste, form, sound, desire, action, and touch are set over against them as the Atigrahas, possibly an indication, since Graha may mean seizer, that the soul was fettered by the organs and their activities, an idea carried out in the phrase 'bands of the heart', which is first found in the Chandogya Upanisad.1 The later term Indriya is first found in the Kauṣitaki Upaniṣad," when on death the father hands over to his son his speech; smell; eye; ear; tastes; actions; pleasure and pain; bliss, delight, and procreation; movements; mind; and intellect (prajñā), where the usual later enumeration of ten with mind is followed, with one exception. In the Bṛhadaranyaka Upanisad we find the skin as the uniting-place of touch; the tongue of tastes; the nose of odours; the eye of forms; the ear of sounds; the mind of conceptions (samkalpa); the heart of knowledge; the hands of actions; the generative organ of pleasure; the anus of procreation; the feet of movements; and speech of the Vedas; but the name, Indriya, is not used. The normal later total of ten with mind, including the heart, as Indriyas is found in the PraŚna, in a passage which also enumerates the five subtle clements, the five gross elements, intellect, individuation, thought, brilliance, and breath.

It is of importance in the history of Indian philosophy to note the develop- ment of the sense of Manas, mind'. In the earliest period, and in the Brāhmaṇas, and even in the Upaniṣads, mind is a vague term 5 denoting con- sciousness generally, whether feeling," willing, or thinking, and it can be used as a synonym for Prajapati, when it is sought to reduce that figure to some- thing more abstract and less mythological. From that use it is later sometimes definitely minimized to mean the power which forms ideas and decisions, but it is probably in the wider and less precise sense that it still appears in all the old lists of the breaths beside speech, cye, ear, and breath. The more limited meaning is possible in cases where mind is said to be the uniting place of con- ceptions, the heart of knowledge, or mind discriminates names, and intellect (prajñā) deals with thoughts, what is to be understood, and desires. On the other hand, there clearly evolves itself, as in Epicharmos' doctrine: vous op kui νοῦς ἀκούει, τἄλλα κωφὰ καὶ τυφλά the idea that the presence of the mind, atten- tion in fact, is necessary to see, to hear, and so forth. Desire, judgement, belief, doubt, unbelief, firmness, weakness, modesty, knowledge, fear, all these depend on the mind. Mind therefore is regarded as forming into idcas the impressions of the senses, sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch, and it then-as will motived by desire-transforms the ideas into resolves, which

are carried out by the organs of action. It is the mind which drives man to beget on his wife a son,1 the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upanisad also says. Similarly the mind is the cause of all action of every kind, sacred study, or the gaining of wealth. In the metaphor of the chariot and the driver, the body and the soul, in the Katha the intellect is the charioteer, mind the reins, and the senses are only the horses. One of the selves in the doctrine of five selves in the Taittiriya Upanisad is expressly called the mind-made self, and its object is sacrificial activity. The Maitrāyaṇīya Upanisad develops the chariot metaphor further; the whip is nature, the horses the organs of action, the reins the organs of intellect, and the driver is mind who with his whip stirs the steeds to action under the control of the reins." 

The mind is specially concerned with Samkalpas, a term which appears only in a late passage of the Rigveda,' but is later frequent. The root idea is putting in order, so that a Samkalpa or conception may be equally well an idea or a decision, though in fact the word is frequently used with an implica- tion of will. Mind is the abode of all Samkalpas, but with the usual inconsis- tency we have Samkalpa ranked above mind, the product above the function." Mind is fundamental; what one desires with it is Kratu, conscious will. 

11

Beside mind we find sometimes the term Citta, which in the Pāli Canon is often a synonym for mind.10 The term cit denotes from the Rigveda on to notice something, whether by the sense organs or by mental activity; in the Chandogya " we find Citta, what is noticed, placed above Samkalpa which in its turn is superior to mind; a contrast is drawn between the man who knows much and has no Citta, and who is accordingly little regarded, and him who has Citta and, therefore, is in high repute. In the sense of thought as an activity Citta is later in use, beside Citti and Cetas, and occasionally mind and Citta or Cetas are directly identified.12 The term Citta becomes of special importance later in the Yoga system. 

Vijñāna, discriminating knowledge, which is made a synonym of mind in the Pali Canon, is sometimes merely a function of mind,13 but it also occurs not rarely in the older Upanisads with a distinct implication of a superior form of knowledge to the mere action of mind; thus hearing, thinking, and discrimi-

nating, or seeing, thinking, and discriminating, are enumerated, and in the final doctrine, which denies the possibility of knowing that which knows all, the term used is vijñā. But this idea is not formally developed, in accord- ance with the whole spirit of the Upanisads. 

On the side of feeling the terminology of the Upanisads marks a great advance in the normal employment of Sukha to denote pleasure generically and Duḥkha, based upon it, for misery. A generic term to cover both forms of feeling is not found before the Vedana of the Pali texts. But we have the definite statement 2 that, when a man experiences pleasure, he acts, when he experiences pain, he refrains from action, while the Kausītaki 3 asserts that pleasure and pain are felt by means of the body.

Of more philosophical interest are efforts made to render more precise the functions of the senses. Thus the Bṛhadaranyaka Upanisad in the doctrine above cited, of eight graspers, or apprehenders (grahas), and eight that are beyond (ati) the graspers, gives as pairs Prāņa and Apana, the former being used to smell odours; speech and names; the tongue and tastes; the eye and visible forms (rupa) (i. e. coloured extension); the ear and sounds; the mind and desires; the hands and action; and the skin and feelings of touch. In the Kausitaki we have speech and name as its external correlate; breath (i.e. smell) and odour; eye and visible form; the ear and sound; the tongue and tastes; the two hands and action; the body and pleasure and pain; the organ of generation and bliss, delight, and procreation; the two feet and movements; and the intellect and thoughts, what is to be under- stood, and desires. The Jaiminiya Upanisad Brāhmaṇa has a series of ten : mind and matters requiring examination (pariksya); speech (i. e. the tongue) 8 and tastes; breath and odours; the eye and visible forms; the ear and sounds;

So in JB. i. 269, where Prana covers smell (as in CB. x. 5. 2.15; BAU. i. 3. 3; CU. i. 2. 2; AU. i. 3. 4; KU.i.7; ii. 5, &c.), and beside ear, eye, smell, and tongue find mind which discriminates suhardasa and durhārdasa, that pleases and displeases the heart. The dis- tinction of functions of mind into sense- perception and the functions of heart and mind (Barua, Prebuddh. Ind. Phil., p. 178) attributed to Yajnavalkya and Mahidasa is clearly not found either in the BAU. or AA. As in JB., I. c., mind and heart are related as activity and organ in Buddhism; Rhys Davids, Buddhist Manual of Psychological Ethics, pp. lxxxvi f.; Keith, Buddhist Philosophy, pp. 87,

the skin and contacts (samsparŚa); the hands and actions; the belly and hunger; the penis and joys; and the feet and roads. These ten are for man either heavens or hells, according to their operation. 

Beyond these parallelisms the relation of sense and object is left unde- termined. The use of the expressions Graha and Atigraha might be held to suggest the view that sense seeks out its object and masters it, and the same doctrine may be found in the Aitareya1 and Kausītaki Upanisads. In the Katha Upanisad 3 we find that the objects are placed above the senses, which might be the sense of the first element in Atigraha, but also that the senses are the steeds and the objects their field of action. A more penetrating analysis is to be found in another passage of the Kausitaki Upanisad, where a set of ten senses and their objects is drawn up, similar to that above cited. In it the objects are described as the external existential elements, Bhutamātrā, correlated to the senses. The process of knowledge is then described by the metaphor of one mounting the object by means of intellect, Prajñā-which for the Kausitaki is the prius from which both senses and objects are derived- and thus attaining it. The senses are declared in similar detail to be uncon- scious without the presence of intelligence; the rule is applied even to mind, which here stands in the place of an organ and has as its object thoughts, what is to be understood, and desires. The passage, however, is characteristic of the somewhat complex and late character of the Upanisad, for the reason given why the other senses are unable to act without intellect is the fact that mind, in the absence of intellect, is elsewhere. Stress is laid on the necessary connexion of existential elements and intellect-elements, Prajñāmātrā; if there were no existential elements, there would be no intellect-elements and vice versa, and without the co-operation of both, no appearance (rupa) whatever would be brought about, the term appearance doubtless standing here as an example of visual cognition and applying to all the other forms of cognition enumerated. At the same time insistence is laid on the fact that there is no ultimate diversity; as the felly rests on the spokes, and the spokes in the hub, so the existential elements rest on the intellect elements, and they again are fixed in Prāņa, which is identified by the Upanisad with the intellect- self, Prajñātman." 

This doctrine obviously is more metaphysical than psychological in interest, and goes a very little way to solve the question of the nature of perception or sensation. This is further borne out by the failure to make clear what is meant by senses as opposed to objects; later we find in the Sāṁkhya' a

[Part V 

distinct recognition of the difference between function and the material organ, the faculty of hearing, for example, and the gross ear, but such a distinction is nowhere hinted at in the Upanisads, and it is uncertain how the matter was regarded in them. In the later texts we find two different theories represented: on the one hand, in the Samkhya philosophy there is a consistent and harmonious materialism of process which, however, is made conscious only by the intervention of the Purusa, which is the equivalent in that system of the Atman of the Vedanta. On the other hand, in the Vedanta, as interpreted by Gauḍapada, stress is laid on the fact that ultimately the visions of a dream and those of our waking state cannot be absolutely distinguished if the dream apparitions are truly produced by the activity of the Atman, so in the case of waking states the objects are equally produced by the Atman: the thing and its representation condition each other: each separately has no existence they exist only in the Atman, a position which, though differen- tiated by Śankara from the idealism of the Buddhist Vijñanavada, tends indefinitely to merge into it. As against these clear theories, which recognize the problem of ideal and real or even material factors in knowledge and supply their varying solutions, we have in Buddhist texts of the earlier period a theory of contact which in the Milindapañha is frankly materialist and was doubtless so ab initio, but which at any rate seems not to have appreciated the real question involved. It is to this confused species of thought that we must in the main turn in considering the views of the Upanisads: the haziness of their ideas is shown conclusively by the fact that often, as later in Buddhism, organ and function seem hardly consciously to be separated in their concep- tion of the activities of sense. Neither realism nor idealism can be said to be yet clearly held. If, as we have seen, in the Kauṣitaki Upanisad we find all existential elements, &c., referred to and made dependent on consciousness, i. e. apparently a subjective idealism, yet in the Madhyandina recension of the Bṛhadaraṇyaka Upanisad we expressly hear of the Atman that after death it is not possessed of empirical consciousness, because it is not in contact with Mātrā, which is most naturally interpreted as a realist or materialist concep- tion, somewhat like that of the Samkhya, such consciousness arising from the contact of the mind and matter, but the term Mātrā may have a wider sense of all empirical existence. Similarly there is abundant evidence of a naïve realism, which places side by side the facts of the macrocosm and the micro- cosm without suggestion that there is any but a real relation.

of the cosmic order (adhidaivata) with the disposition of man (adhyatma) is constant and wearisome; the space within the heart is parallel to cosmic space; 1 the breath of man to the wind, the speech to fire, the eye to the sun, the ear to the moon, the mind to the lightning; * there are five cosmic spaces, five gods of nature, five classes of beings, and correspondingly we have five vital airs, five senses, five parts of the body; to name, form, and action in the world correspond speech, sight, and man in the individual; there is Dharma, law, and truth for the world and for the man, and the macrocosm and the micro- cosm are interrelated in an indissoluble union of reciprocal service and support. The general attitude of the Upanisads must, therefore, be described as realistic, and, accordingly, not incompatible with a rejection of the subjective idealism of the Vijñānavädins. Here and there this interpretation suggests itself with special force, as when it is expressly made clear that the Atman is the real active force in seeing, in smelling, in speaking, in hearing, in thinking, and the senses are but means," or again the Atman is pictured like the occan as the abode of all the sense activities.8 From the Samkhya view the Upanisads are distinguished in an important respect, the frank recognition accorded by them of the activity of the Atman, while in the Samkhya view the Puruşa has really no activity, though paradoxically all consciousness is made to depend on the imaginary connexion of the Puruşa with Prakṛti. 

9 

There is, naturally enough, no trace in the Upanisads of any clear apprecia- tion of the distinction between mere sensation and ideas such as Dignaga made distinct in his doctrine of sensation as without operation of abstract thought (kalpanapodha) as opposed to definite cognition (savikalpaka),10 though, in a sense, this distinction might be held to be latent in the contrast noted above of the senses and the mind as sources of knowledge. This fact renders it most improbable, a priori, that from the very beginning Bud- 

dhism had established this difference: vijñāna and its synonyms, citta, manaḥ, represent pure sensation, the same as the kalpanapoḍha pratyakṣa of Dignaga, and sanjña corresponds to definite ideas'. The realization of the possibility

Both popularly and theoretically cakṣur duhkham means that vision is sorrow, not that vision is unrest. translation of arya-satya as Aryan facts adopted (ibid. p. 48, n. 3) is philologically objectionable, because we have not the slightest ground for belief that in the time when the phrase arose Arya had any ethnic connotation at all. 

The

thus of treating Vijñāna in the scheme of the five Skandhas must have been slow; it is emphatically not reached by the Pāli texts of the Canon,1 and, like all refined conceptions, can be attributed to early Buddhism only at the expense of historical truth. 

Naturally it might be expected that from an examination of the relation of the Atman to the questions of time and space some light would be cast on the aspect in which the Atman was viewed. But unfortunately the' account of time in the Upanisads is quite valueless from the point of view of philosophy: in the Atharvaveda we have Kala set forth as the highest principle of the universe, and the waters and even Prajapati are derived from it. In the Upanisads we have little more than this: an affectedly obscure passage in the later part of the Maitrāyaṇīya Upanisad exalts time as being the Brahman, the highest principle, the source of all that is; the CvetaŚvatara 4 mentions time, nature, necessity, accident, material, and spirit as various rival theories of being, but declares time as past, present, and future to be inferior to the Brahman; and the Bṛhadaranyaka Upanisad derives time from the Brahman, and declares it to be lord of the past and the future. In the view of Śankara," while time is absolutely non-existent in the true sense of existence, since all but the one is illusion, time, space and causality are in themselves on the standpoint of the lower knowledge truly real; but it is perfectly clear that in the case of the Upanisads the nature of time has not received any real investigation. 

5 

A more favourable view of the achievement of early Indian philosophy is taken by F. Otto Schrader," who contends that the distinction between the ordinary or empiric and a higher or transcendental time can be traced back to the Kala hymns of the Atharvaveda and is recognizable in the epic in such phrases as Time leads me in time'. With this distinction he connects the declaration of the Maitrāyaṇīya Upanisad regarding the time that has parts, and is later than the sun and the stars, and the non-time which is without parts, and is earlier, and the distinction later made between time which cooks, or matures, all beings and him in whom time is matured. Later doubtless we do find developed the doctrine that the changing time which we observe in daily life is only time as an effect (kāryakāla), the cause of which is a time without sections (akhandakāla) and unchanging, and that there must be a sphere or

condition which is totally unaffected by time, though time exist in it as an instrument. But there seems no real reason why we should ascribe any of these developed conceptions to the Upanisad period.1

The same remark applies even more strongly to space, the conception of which can hardly be said to be fully apprehended in the Upanisads. The term AkaŚa, which is rendered ether' in accordance with the established usage, denotes in the opinion of Böhtlingk the empty space, the elements Vayu and AkāŚa, representing wind and atmosphere, corresponding to the Greek ȧnp, there being no idea to correspond with the ether of the Greek view. The AkaŚa was conceived, in his view, as empty space, the atmosphere as opposed to the wind not being regarded as corporeal. Whether this view is correct can- not be determined with certainty from the evidence: it can be made com- patible with whatever is said regarding AkaŚa, but on the other hand it is not clear that this conception is always adequate. The term AkaŚa first appears in the Brāhmaṇa style, and denotes room or space through which one can pass or into which one can thrust a finger. Further, the space between the sky and the earth when they separated is the Antarikṣa or atmosphere, and, in contrast to the wind, Vayu, which as an element is normally rendered air, at the cost of some confusion of idea, the atmosphere is regarded as something empty, being compared in the Taittiriya Samhita 5 to not-being. On the other hand, just as not-being is in a sense something concrete, the AkaŚa is more than mere space. Man, the Kausītaki tells us, is born from the ĀkāŚa as from a womb ; when fire heats the AkaŚa, then rain falls, in the view of the Chandogya ; the Taittiriya makes the ĀkāŚa born from the self, and from the AkaŚa the wind is born. Yet in it are the sun and the moon, lightning, stars and fire; by means of it one calls, hears and answers; in it a man is born, and has joy; in it he meets a woman. Thus the AkaŚa approaches the sense of space, though a material space, but it seems that it does not denote space in the most general sense, but rather the space between the sky and the earth, which is around us.10 The idea is evidently a considerable advance on the mythological presentation of the quarters as divinities, which tends here and there to pass over into an attempt to express space as opposed to time, symbolized by the seasons. The combination of the terms, Dię and AkaŚa, appears in the Maitrāyaṇīya Upanisad, which describes AkaŚa as a lotus flower whose leaves are the four quarters and the four intermediate quarters or cardinal points.

have, however, in the fact that ether is treated regularly as one of the five elements a warning against regarding it as essentially distinct in the view of the Upanisads from the other more obvious material elements.1 Yet it must be noted that in Buddhism no serious advance was made in attempting to under- stand the nature of space; it was for some unintelligible reason excluded from non-derived Rupa,2 and, when the Andhakas claimed that the room between objects was perceptible, this view was rejected, a defect which has been traced to the failure of Buddhism to investigate the true function of mind.3 

The position with regard to causality is the same. In the Samkhya system and in the Buddhist the category of causality is regarded as truly existing, and the Samkhya quite seriously applies the doctrine of causality as enabling it to determine the nature of its final principles: the things of empirical life are referred ultimately to one ground in nature, Prakṛti, while again the unfolding of nature is essentially relative to some principle for whose advantage it takes place, which is the Purușa. In the Upanisads a theory of causality is not to be found, and the early texts have not the term, Karana; nor is this remarkable: in effect the Brahman is essentially above all cause: when the categories of place, time, substance, and cause disappear, then the Brahman remains over, as it is said in a very late text. The Chandogya Upanisad 5 uses the idea of root and shoot to convey the idea of derivation. 

Imperfect, however, as are the views of the Upanisads on these points, the defects of their theories must not be exaggerated. The amount of progress made in developing speculation on these questions for many centuries after was very slight, as can be seen from even a brief glance at the Buddhist theory of sense as developed in the Pāli Nikayas. In that theory the chief difference is unquestionably the effort to do without a self at all, which was clearly one aspect of the Buddhist faith, though by no means the only aspect and certainly in the long run not the most important. But apart from the odium theologicum it is impossible to grant this attempt any real validity at all: it would have been easy to show that the conception of the Atman attained by the Brahmans was inadequate, but it was merely a retrogression to solve the problem by ignoring its existence: there is nothing in the Nikayas to suggest the most moderate competence in treating of the matter, the whole Buddhist position

It may be urged that the view of the Buddhists has an analogy-imper- fect indeed-in modern psychology (Walleser, Das Problem des Ich, p. 74). But this proves the essential point that modern psychology is, as developed, an empirical science and therefore abstracts from its data by ignoring the transcendental aspect of the 'I' element. When as in Buddhism this aspect is absolutely denied, a process legitimate in science is introduced with fatal results into philosophy.

being rendered easy by the illegitimate assumption, whenever necessary, of the subject which is denied. It is an elementary fact that a sensation is nothing if not an experience for an individual being, and, while for a definite scientific purpose we are doubtless free, if we will, to ignore the subjective factor, if we carry this ignoring into the field of philosophy, we deal with a false abstraction; nor is it less false because it has appealed to the enthusiastic, but confused mind of William James.1 The Upaniṣads frankly do not face the question of memory, but leave it a possibility. But even in the Abhidhamma the problem of reinstatement and the conditions of reinstatement are not raised as matters calling for definition. If even we go to a far later period, 

6 

a formula 3 like the upspringing of potential cittas, not empty and mutually disconnected, but each fraught with the informing satti of this or that among former citta continua', appears both clumsy and question-begging as a sub- stitute for the conception of a real unity in multiplicity, since a citta continuum is clearly impossible without such a unity. 

6 

Nor is any progress made in the analysis of consciousness. It is true 4 that in place of the occasional remarks of the Upanisads we find in the Buddhist texts interminable repetitions of the same facts regarding all the senses which are, therefore, more definitely recognized than in some portions of the Upanisads, but any real progress in defining sense perception remains to be pointed out. On the contrary, we have the old view which makes no clear distinction if any at all between the organ and the sensation, and as late as the Milindapañha, as we have seen, sensation is expressed in terms of mere material contact. The position of mind, Mano, remains precisely what it was in the Upanisads: it is wholly erroneous 5 to compare it with the sensus com- munis of Aristotle, whose two special functions, that of self-consciousness and of consciousness of the common sensibles, by no means correspond with those of Mano, which is rather in origin a power without which the senses would in effect not perceive at all, and which in a more effective psychology might have been developed into the psychical representative of sensation conveyed through the physiological apparatus. Even the position of touch as in some sense the most fundamental of the senses which is claimed for the Dhamma- samgani can hardly be accepted as in any way a really scientific theory, as it is only enunciated in company with an extraordinarily unintelligible doctrine of the position of what is somewhat hypothetically interpreted as the cohesive element. The primitive nature of the process of consciousness as conceived in the Nikayas is obvious from the stereotyped account of the origin of

knowledge.1 Through the eye and visible form arises visual consciousness: the collision of the two factors is contact: conditioned by contact arises feel- ing: what one feels one perceives: what one perceives one thinks about: what one thinks about one is obsessed withal. The crudeness and valuelessness of the theory is obvious at once from the very fact that it is wholly impossible to understand what precise sense was attributed to the several terms, for the explanations of the scholiast are in all likelihood nothing but the interpreta- tions of later generations of thinkers, who had to do their best to make the most out of the tradition of the text. The Buddhists too remain with the Upanisads on the basis of the dwelling of the soul or its equivalent in the heart,* which is thus brought into the theory of sensation. What is indeed of interest is not the development of doctrine in the Nikayas, which give us only a few changes in terminology such as the metaphor of the doors of the senses,3 but the extraordinary persistence in Buddhism of the psychology of the Upaniṣads. 

In addition to the mind and the sense organs, the soul possesses the breaths or vital airs. Prana, originally breath', then used often as a name for the absolute, is in the Upanisads a constant expression for the whole sum of the organs of sense, and at the same time a special one breath, beside eye, car, mind, and speech. It, however, in the growing development of the doctrine of mind and the organs of sense is gradually reduced to minor importance, and becomes concerned not with the intellectual aspect of the soul, but with the principle of life as opposed to intellect. The single Prana in this aspect is divided into five, which, however, are also sometimes given as two, Prāņa and Apana, as three, these with Vyana, or four, these with Udana. The Jaimi- nīya Upanisad Brāhmaṇa gives Prāņa, Apāna, Vyana, Samana, Avana, and Udana; or seven in the head, or nine, including two below, and a tenth in the navel. The precise sense of these terms has been much disputed, but it is not open to serious doubt that alone Prāņa or Apana may mean breath simply, whether in or out, and therefore Prāņa may mean smell. In contrast, how-

ever, they are on the one hand expiration, on the other inspiration. Apāna, however, has the definite sense of the downward wind, which presides over evacuation in not a few passages; it also often denotes smell. Vyana is the bond of union of the two, that is either the power which maintains life when neither expiration nor inspiration takes place, or the breath connecting the upper and the lower breaths. Samāna is not clearly defined: it is said to connect expiration and inspiration, which seems needless; or to assimilate food. Udana conducts the soul from the body on death, or leads in deep sleep to the Brahman. 

But, besides these psychical and physiological elements, in the later view, the soul has, as individual, certain other permanent entities, the elements, and a mind-disposition attached to it. It is clearly 1 in one place regarded at death as being connected with earth, water, wind, ether, and fire and its opposite, and also with desire and its opposite, anger and its opposite, and justice and its opposite, as well as with the organs. The same idea seems in metaphorical form to be found in the view 2 that for rebirth the waters are five times offered in sacrifice as faith, the Soma, rain, food, and seed to become a man. The term Linga found in a verse added here is apparently used technically to denote the entity which transmigrates as early as the Kaṭha at least, and in the Maitrāyaṇīya Upaniṣad it has its full technical sense. Much more often, however, we hear of the moral qualities and power of remembrance of the self which go on the journey of transmigration.

Of the gross body we learn that the scat of the breaths, of the mind, and even of the organs of sense is really in the heart, where in sleep the organs remain and where in death they gather: nay, the heart is even identified with the Brahman, and is essentially its home: the name hṛdayam is derived from hṛdy ayam,' he here in the heart 2.5 In the golden lotus of the heart is the ether in which heaven and earth, sun, moon, and stars arc enclosed, into which

From the connexion of mind with the heart is derived the Theravadin (BSOS. iii. 353) view which places a hadaya-vatthu as the organ of mind, evidently the older Buddhist view as opposed to the refinement of the Sarvăstivädin (contrast Stcher- batsky, The Central Conception of Buddhism, pp. 17 f.).

the soul enters in sleep, and in which the immortal golden Puruşa resides.1 It is the cavity in which the Brahman is concealed. Round the heart are the veins 72,000 in number, and these, by another turn of thought, are conceived as of five colours, uniting with the rays of the sun similarly coloured and thus connecting the sun and the heart. In deep sleep the soul glides into the veins and through them it becomes one with the heart. At death the soul is con- ceived as passing out by the veins, and the rays of the sun, which the wise find open to them, while the entrance is closed to the ignorant. By yet another turn of thought the conception is reached that only one vein leads to the sun out of 101, the vein in question leading to the head, presumably in connexion with the fact that there is the suture, the Brahmarandhra,5 through which in the process of creation the Brahman is supposed to enter the body as spirit. Later accounts such as that of the PraŚna merge the two versions of 72,000 and 101 veins into one, the 101 veins having each 100 branches, each of which has 72,000 sub-branches, in all 727,210,201.

The body itself is derived from the three elements, recognized in the Chan- dogya Upanisad by the rule that the dense parts become the coarse (faeces, urine, bone), the medium the medium (flesh, blood, marrow), constituents of the body, and the finest the mind, breath, and speech, corresponding to food or earth, water, and heat. The soul is nourished by the blood massed in the heart, thus enjoying purer (pravivikta) food than the gross body.8 The pro- duction of the body is traced to the seed of the father," and different views of the nature of the process of generation can be traced; in the simplest form it is said that the seed is the self of the father, which enters the woman and becomes part of herself; 10 but it is also said, in more exact accordance 11 with the doctrine of the transmigration of souls, that the seed is merely a stage on the course of the rebirth of the soul, which in the moon has exhausted its good works it comes down through the ether, the wind, smoke, rain, plants, seed, and the mother's womb, in cach of which it of course has merely a tem- porary habitation: from yet another point of view 12 the cause of procreation is the desire for reunion of the two halves of the same being originally united, but divided as male and female by Prajapati. But the primitive view of the Upanisads is clear that the production of offspring is a religious duty, which was inculcated on the student at the close of the studentship: a chapter on how to secure certain qualities in the child is incorporated in the Bṛhada- ranyaka Upanisad 13 probably for this very reason.

is clear proof of the gradual advance of the spirit of asceticism, in complete harmony with the fact that the knowledge of the Atman shows that all desires for children to continue the race, to discharge the debt to the Fathers, to expiate the faults of their parents in life, are idle and foolish. The Brahmans, who have known the self, are twice declared in the Bṛhadaranyaka Upanisad 1 to have held aloof from the desire of children, 'What need have we of off- spring, whose soul is the universe?' By a bizarre conception, found here only in the late Garbha Upanisad, the embryo in the ninth month is conceived as remembering all its previous births and its good and evil deeds, a remembrance which is taken from it by the pangs of birth.2 

In addition to creatures born alive, other creatures exist born from a germ or shoot (udbhid), born from eggs, and born from moisture like insects and so forth. These ideas which are found only in two passages in the Upanisads a are decisive for later philosophy, but their connexion with the theories of the Upanisads is nowhere indicated. 

## 09. The Four States of the Soul 

The soul, despite its close connexion with the body, which we have traced in detail, is also enabled by its nature to approach closely the absolute. The spirit is most remote from the absolute in its normal waking activities: in that case the senses and the mind are at work, but when there is sleep the senses and the mind are merged in the breath. A further distinction is then made between the condition of the soul in the sleep of dreams, and in deep dreamless sleep, in which the soul enters into the purest light, and then as a consequence of its own nature emerges again from it. These three stages alone are found in the oldest Upanisads, and it is not till the latest Upanisads that a fourth is added in accordance with the constant tendency further to subdivide. 

The philosophical importance of the doctrine 4 lies in the effect which the investigation of the stages of the soul must have had on the conception of the soul itself. The early identification of the soul with Prāņa as breath must have been suggested by the fact of the permanence of the breath despite the cessation in sleep of the activities of the mind; death overcomes the voice, the eye, the ear, but while these are sunk in sleep the breath perishes not.5 It is a further step, but one intelligible enough, to the conclusion that, though the body perishes in death, yet the breath remains, for the breath is invisible and there is, therefore, no ground to assume that the falling to pieces of the body affects its being. We attain thus the conception of the self as

The Philosophy of the Veda 

[Part V 

something which does not perish, which, therefore, is without beginning and without end, and as the essential element in man we find all activities resolved ultimately into Prāņa on their cessation. On a higher level of thought we have the concept Prajña, intelligence, substituted for the breath, in recognition of the psychic side of man and of the fact that it is consciousness or intelligence which is aware of breath and of all man's life, and in it also all else is resolved. Advancing still further on the path of abstraction, we attain the concept of the Atman as that which knows, without possessing any empiric object, suggested inevitably by the condition attained in deep dreamless sleep. The identity of such an Atman with the Brahman is obviously an easy step, and this may well have been a factor in achieving the identification. Obviously also the tendency to attain the unity in question by means of artificial pro- cesses of mental suppression arises immediately from the desire to imitate artificially the condition achieved in deep sleep, but under natural conditions inevitably only for a limited period, and subject to the possibility of dreams.

In the waking state the man uses all his faculties and is confronted by a real world, but the waking state is in reality merely a dream condition, since it has not true reality, and the man who is awake is really furthest removed from the clear knowledge usually attached to the waking condition. Hence in the Aitareya Upanisad 1 we find three sleeps or dreams mentioned which may well be the three states, the first regarded as dreaming no less than the other two. In the case of a dream, however, the outer world is not there: 2 there are no carts, horses, roads, but he makes them for himself; there is no joy, happiness, nor desire, but he makes them for himself; wells, pools, and streams also he fashions for himself. The spirit serves as light for itself in this condition. From another point of view the primitive idea of the absence of the mind during sleep is recognized, and a warning given not lightly to waken the sleeper, lest he not easily find his way back to the body. These two views, the activity of the self in the body in sleep, and the journeying of the self from the body, are united in a third which pictures the self as engaged in the process of wandering through his own body here and there. The vital spirits are then treated as being his subjects, who attend him in his movements, like a king, through the realm of his body. The nature of the dream consciousness is shown also by the Upanisads to be closely connected with the character of the consciousness which was enjoyed in the waking life, and which thus is the material (mātrā) on which the soul acts; what a man feared might happen to him, to be slain, to be flayed, to be trampled on by an elephant, or plunged into a pit, all these ideas crowd in upon him. In the PraŚna the whole

process of dreaming is a review of what has been experienced in the waking 

state. 

From the ordinary process of dreaming sleep a transition is made to deep sleep, when the soul advances more closely to the world to come, and from the mere consciousness of individual things, such as the concept of being a king or a god, becomes conscious of itself as the universe, in which case, however, there is no longer any possibility of contrast between subject and object, and ordinary consciousness is superseded by the union for the time being with the Prajña Atman, the intelligent self, the absolute. In this condition, as a man in the embrace of his darling wife does not have any consciousness of outer or inner, so the spirit embraced by the self consisting of knowledge has no con- sciousness of outer and inner. The spirit in this condition is without desire and free from all pain; it is unaffected by good, unaffected by evil, the father ceases to be father, the mother mother, the worlds worlds, the gods gods. There is no interruption of seeing, though the spirit sees not: we have in fact the condition of a purc objectless knowing subject, continuing in this condition. The soul now passes from the 72,000 veins in which it has moved during dream-sleep, and rests in the pericardium in supreme bliss, like a great king or Brahman. The Chandogya 2 follows the same line of thought, but it lays stress on the entry of the self into the brilliance or heat, treats the soul as existing in the veins, which is possibly found also in the Bṛhadaraṇyaka, and, by a curious confusion of ideas which is already foreshadowed or perhaps rather later borrowed and interpolated in the Bṛhadaranyaka, the joys of free movement which belong mercly to dreaming sleep are in one later passage ascribed to the deep sleep also. The Kauṣitaki makes the deep sleep the union with breath, which in its scheme is identical with the intellectual self, which is the absolute. 

4 

In this condition of sleep without dreams it is clear that the older Upanisads find the highest bliss, the complete union of the individual with the absolute," which is all that can be attained by man. In the later Upanisads there appears the effort to add a fourth condition, called by its numerical designation the Caturtha or more archaically Turiya. This state is that which is attained not in deep sleep, but in the waking condition by the effort of concentration of the mind which is Yoga. The two conditions of deep sleep and the fourth differ, not in point of their failing to recognize plurality, but in the fact that the Turiya knows no slumber: the Turiya is neither deep asleep nor dreaming:

the dreamer has false knowledge, the sleeper has none. It is obviously im- possible to make much of this refinement and still less of the four subdivisions of it which a later Upanisad, the Nṛsinhottara,1 invents. Oltramare, while recognizing the possibility that even in the period of the Upanisads there may have been felt the necessity of making some effort to supply an ideal which would not, like the established conception, find the only true reality in an entity deprived of that consciousness which is in experience the most essential and real part of existence, admits that in this conception of the Māṇḍūkya Upanisad we have nothing more than a logical construction, even if in ultimate analysis the phenomena of ecstasy may have given a basis for the conception. 

The Upanisads assume in these accounts of the states of the soul the dis- tinction between the knowledge possessed in dreams and that which the soul enjoys in waking moments. But in what does this important distinction consist? The answer to this problem, which is much discussed in later philosophy, cannot be supplied effectively from the Upanisads themselves, which, as has been seen, still fall short of developing a theory of the nature of sensation and perception. 

## 10. The Doctrine of Transmigration 

The origin of the doctrine of transmigration is one of the most difficult problems of Indian philosophy: its extraordinarily firm hold on the mind of part at least of India, which is shown by the fact that Buddhism rests on the doctrine as an essential presupposition, makes it natural to seck the view in the earliest period of Indian religion, and this desire to find metempsychosis in the beginnings of Indian belief takes two forms. On the one hand there have been seen direct references to metempsychosis in the Rigveda, and on the other there have been traced there ideas which explain the genesis of the con- ception. 

The references to transmigration which have been seen in the Rigveda are all of the most improbable character: it is to ignore the nature of poetry to press the wish that there may be long life for man among the gods into the view that it contemplates rebirth: the attempt to find references to it in two of the verses of the riddle hymn of Dirghatamas 5 is bold, but not very plausible the allusion, in which Vasistha is made to refer to his previous

It is clear that the self is always an entity, but in CU. viii. 11. 1 the state of deep sleep is treated as annihilation, and in lieu the self is given the attributes of motion free from the body sporting with women or friends (as illogically in BAU. iv. 3. 15). This clearly indicates an effort to give individuality and pleasure to the self in its highest form.

birth, is quite impossible, and the same criticism can be applied in every other case.1 The effort to find such views is naturally not modern merely the commentaries on the Upanisads themselves seek to trace the idea, and the fact that they can adduce nothing worthy of consideration is surely con- clusive proof that there was nothing. In the Bṛhadaranyaka Upanisad it is sought by Śankara, without any good ground, and not in accord with the Upanisad, to show that Vamadeva, the reputed author of a hymn 3 beginning, 'I was aforetime Manu, I the sun ', refers to his former births, and in another passage of that text, in the exposition of the doctrine of transmigration, a verse celebrating the two ways of the Fathers and of the gods, on which everything meets which moves between father and mother, is pressed by the Upanisad itself into service, though the reference is merely to day and night. A third passage in the Aitareya Aranyaka, which refers to a third birth after death, beside that from the father and by initiation, makes also use of a verse of Vamadeva, in which lying in the womb the speaker learned all the births of the gods, but it is not proved or even plausible that the Upanisad itself refers to transmigration at all: the third birth may most probably have been in the next world, and in any case the quotation had nothing whatever to do with the subject. 

7 

The effort to find suggestions of the origin of transmigration in Vedic beliefs is worthy of more consideration. The ideas that the birds are the forms of the Fathers, and that the Fathers creep about the roots of the plants, and the practice of using an insect or other animal, which alighted on a gar- ment spread out with an invocation to the soul of the dead, when his bones cannot be found, to serve in place of his mortal relics, are points adduced by Oldenberg 10 as suggesting the groundwork on which the Indian belief developed. It is not necessary to brush " these ideas lightly aside, or even to point out that the evidence for them is late, and not of value as proof for the early Vedic religion. What is necessary is to point out that, while the ideas thus recorded are of some value as showing the presence in Indian religion of the belief of the incorporation of the souls of the dead now and then in animals or plants-of the latter there is even a hint in the Rigveda 12 itself-the importance

[Part V 

of transmigration lies precisely in the fact that the doctrine is an ethical system, and that it has, therefore, not merely a value totally distinct from the mere belief suggested by the evidence above adduced, but is thereby referred for its real origin to something quite other than popular belief. That it should have been so fully accepted by the people in course of time was doubtless aided by such views as that mentioned: but no such view could create metempsychosis as a system of the marked character of the Indian view. 

The Brāhmaṇas contain on the whole no acceptance of the doctrine of transmigration: the soul aims at the world of the Fathers as before the mere fact that as punishment for the cursing of a Brahman, the laying of violent hands on him, or the spilling of his blood, the wrong-doer is kept a hundred, a thousand years, as many years as the grains of dust moistened by his blood, from the world of the Fathers, shows that the view still prevailed that this world was the appointed place for the holy dead even as it is in the Rigveda. Nor in the main is that world distinct from heaven to which a man naturally goes but sometimes fails to reach, confused by the smoke of the fire which burned his body.2 The conception of weighing the good and evil of a man in a balance and his following whichever is the greater, and that of two fires which hold back the wicked from the way of the gods or of the Fathers, do not carry us to any definite view other than that of the Rigveda, and the con- ception of men being discriminated as good or bad in the presence of Yama is equally unimportant. But a new and important motive appears in the growing fear of death even in the world to come. 

5 

This fear seems, as we have seen, to have developed in accordance with the desire to distinguish the diverse degrees of good acquired by different modes of sacrifice; it was obviously necessary to admit that every sacrificer would receive reward by admission to the happiness of the world to come, but the Brahmans had to consider the claims of the richer of their patrons, and had to promise them more in the world to come than the poorer, who offered and gave less. Hence we find that the need of food in the next world may be severely limited, according to the mode of offering: it can be unnecessary for a spirit to feed oftener than once in fourteen days, in four, six, or twelve months, or even once only in a hundred years, or even never at all. Again it is said that sacrifice to the gods produces less than offering to the self." Naciketas begs that he may be granted the privilege that his good deeds shall not decay," while it is said that day and night wear out the good deeds in the

adoption of the view; cf. Oldenberg, Die Lehre der Upanishaden, pp. 27 ff.; Leumann, Buddha und Mahāvīra, p. 15. 1 TS.ii. 6. 10. 2.

next world of one who does not know a certain rite.1 The fear thus forms itself that in place of the desired immortality in the next world there will be renewed death, and many rites 2 are said to save from it, the Agnihotra, the Vişūvant, the Naciketas fire, the piling of the fire, the study of the Veda. There can be no doubt that the repeated death is in the next world, not in this it is applied to the Fathers, and from those who are born after death to immortality are distinguished those who are born to die again. The idea of the death as being a birth in the next world is not at all rare, as in the passage of the Aitareya Upanisad above mentioned, and the conception that death might there be repeated is a very natural one. It remained only to transfer it to the present world and the effect of transmigration was reached. But though this step is taken in the Upaniṣads it is by no means universally to be found there: there is no clear reference in the Aitareya Aranyaka or Upanisad, and the Bṛhadaranyaka 5 has passages which quite clearly do not recognize it at all.

9 

The earliest notice of the doctrine of transmigration preserved for us, apart from a few very dubious allusions in the Śatapatha Brahmana," is to be traced in the Bṛhadaranyaka Upanisad in the section ascribed to Yajnavalkya. It is founded in an idea which is plainly expressed but merely as an incidental view in the Rigveda that at death the eye of man goes to the sun, the breath to the wind, the speech to the fire, and the members are also dispersed. This conception which has no importance for the Rigveda is developed in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa in one of the passages which approach the Upanisad character, and in the Bṛhadaranyaka, after a long enumeration of the modes of disposal of the parts of man in this way, it is asked where the man then remains. On this Yajnavalkya takes the questioner Artabhāga apart and confers with him in secret, and what they conversed about was work, and what they commended that was work. In truth, it is added, a man becomes good by good works, evil by evil. In a subsequent passage 10 the matter is further explained by the doctrine that on death, like a caterpillar-or grass leech- proceeding from one leaf to another, the soul, having shaken off the body and freed itself from ignorance, presumably empirical life, makes a beginning on another body. As a goldsmith chisels out a newer and fairer form from a piece of carving, so the soul fashions for itself another newer, fairer form, whether it be of the Fathers, or the Gandharvas, or the gods, or Prajāpati, or Brahman, or other living beings; 11 just as man acts, just as he behaves, so will

he be born. He who does good will be born good, he who does evil will be born evil he becomes holy by holy deeds, evil by evil. Hence is explained the view that man is composed of desire, in proportion to desire is his will, in proportion to his will he performs acts, and according to his acts does it happen to him. Or, as an appended verse has it, having attained the end of his deeds committed on earth, he returns from yonder world to the world of work.

That this doctrine does not teach the transmigration from one body to another is asserted by Schrader,1 but this view can only be taken as a tour de force, even apart from the appended verse, which expressly makes the trans- migration clear. It is also certain that, apart from the verse which is doubtful in sense, it is a simple transmigration by reason of character or action. It is a change of the soul & from one body into another, and the instances cited are better bodies, as they are of better results from good action in the present life: the other beings who are mentioned are, therefore, to be understood of higher beings, in all likelihood, than man. It is only in the later Madhyandina recension of this passage that the form of a man is inserted. Yajñavalkya, then, considered that transmigration was the fate of men, who had not the know- ledge of the identity of the individual and the absolute, which ended the possibility of transmigration of any kind: exactly what sort of fate awaited the bad, he does not say, but clearly they would take on at best the forms of beings inferior to themselves, perhaps men of lower degree, animals, &c. 

The appended verse is interpreted by Śañkara to refer to the fact that the soul is not merely rewarded by being transferred to another body, but before 

Rigveda, which is an entity preceding 

its master to heaven; cf. Naciketas's store of good deeds. Geldner (see Lindenau, ZII. i. 49 n.) sees in AV. x. 7. 11 a reference to the persistence of Tapas, which is an element of Karman, but the passage is very obscure. 

1 ZDMG. lxiv. 333-5. 

2 Deussen, Sechzig Upanishad's, p. 476, n. 3; Windisch, Buddha's Geburt, pp. 70, 71. 

3 This is made clear by BAU. iv. 4. 3 ff., 

which Jacobi (Die Entwicklung der Gottesidee bei den Indern, p. 9) wrongly ignores in his contention that Karman was regarded as a transcendent power bringing into being a new psychic complex, no permanent self being known. It is also very dubious if we can accept his view that the origin of Karman in a philosophic sense is to be found in the Mimānsă doctrine of Apūrva, a mysterious entity, which attaches itself to the soul of man when he has offered sacrifice and clings to him until such time as his action bears 

its fruit (cf. Keith, Karma-Mīmāṁsā, pp. 36, 73 ff., 89). This theory was naturally enough evoked by the fact that the sacrifice often did not reap any immediate fruit, and it was, there- fore, necessary to provide something to preserve continuity. But we need not believe this bizarre speculation very old; it can hardly have been needed so long as any real belief in the Vedic gods survived; in the Mimänsä that has wholly disappeared. In the Jain theory Karman is definitely material (von Glasenapp, Die Lehre vom Karman), but it seems very dubious if Stcher- batsky (The Central Conception of Buddhism, p. 34) is right in ascribing a semi-material nature to Karman in Buddhism; the Jains remained on an extremely primitive level of thought which other schools earlier outlived. The idea of Karman, however, was doubtless affected inter alia by the conception of sin (enas, āgas) as clinging in a quasi-physical way to a man.

that period undergoes reward or punishment for its deeds in the appropriate place. The question of its precise meaning is not important: it may mean merely that he transmigrates after completing one life. But the important fact is that, with the doctrine of action as determining the future life of man, there comes to be combined the doctrine of reward in heaven or punishment elsewhere, which is already seen in the Rigveda and more clearly in the Atharvaveda, and which we need not doubt was a popular belief, and this combination is already found in the two main texts which are our sources for the transmigration doctrine. Of these the Bṛhadaranyaka 2 version is found in the sixth book which occurs in the appendix, and this fact alone indicates its later date. The other version is in the Chandogya,3 and here as always that Upanisad shows its dependence in the case of common material on the Bṛhadāraṇyaka. A somewhat corrupt version is also given in the second PariŚiṣṭa of the Nirukta. 

The account is divided naturally into two parts. The first is the theory the five fires, which is an account apparently of the mode in which the soul on death passes immediately, without intermediate reward or punishment, into the new body. The burning of the body on death is here taken by a new turn of thought as the offering of sacrifice, and the essential part of the offering, the action of man, is figured as the waters, which are offered with faith; hence the faith takes the place of the waters as the expression for the part which transmigrates. The faith, which thus ascends in the form of the sacrificial vapour to the gods, is by them offered in the heaven, the atmosphere, the earth, the man, and the woman as sacrificial fires, changing thus first to the Soma, then to rain, then to food, then to seed, and then to the embryo, and then receiving existence afresh. The mythical character of the whole is obvious, and reminds us that the new doctrine of action as determining the future life was decidedly disadvantageous to the sacrificial priest, and that it was natural to reserve it as a holy mystery. 

The second part of the account deals with the two ways, that of the gods and of the Fathers, and it teaches the doctrine first of punishment in the next world, and then rebirth on earth for those persons who were not to receive full enlightenment. The Devayāna, originally in the Rigveda the path by which the sacrifice of a man was borne to the gods or by which they came for it, and by which on death he joined the Fathers and the gods in heaven, is trans- formed into the path by which the soul goes to the gods or to the absolute. On the burning of the body the soul enters the flame, then the day, the bright half of the month, the bright half of the year, the year, the sun, the moon (in the Chandogya version), the lightning, and finally, led by a spiritual man or,

This is a point of difference from the

as the Chandogya has it, a superhuman man, into the world of Brahman. The terms are of course to be understood spatially, but in later India they were interpreted as temporal, and thus in the great epic the death of Bhisma is delayed by that warrior so that he may die in the Uttarayana, the northern course of the sun.1 In the case of the Pitṛyana the course is different: the moon is common to both since the moon was often regarded as the home of the dead, and in the Upanisads its waxing and waning were brought into con- nexion with the movements of the souls: hence the path is the smoke, the night, the dark half of the month, the dark half of the year, the world of the Fathers in lieu of the year, the ether not the sun, the moon, which is now not a stage of transit to the world of Brahman, but the highest place attained by the souls. The arrival of the souls fills up the moon, so that in the meta- phorical language of the Upanisads they are enjoyed by the gods, a view which the Vedanta reduces to the principle that the souls and the gods together delight therein. This time of felicity ends only when the merit of the soul is finished, and then it returns to earth by the process, in its last stages very difficult, of being materialized into ether, wind, smoke, mist, cloud, rain, plants, food, seed, and entrance into the womb of the mother to be followed by rebirth. The way of the Fathers is the lot of those who are bent on sacrifice, works of piety, and asceticism (in the Chandogya, sacrifice, gifts, and alms- giving), while that of the gods which leads to the Brahman is allotted to the wise who know the doctrine and those who in the forest worship faith (in the Chandogya, worship faith and asceticism, unless it means worship, holding that faith is asceticism'). The lot of the wicked appears to have been the third place which led to birth again as animals, of the lower insect orders, worms, or flies. In the Chandogya Upanisad the position is differentiated by the division of the classes of souls, which go to the moon, into those of good and those of abominable conduct: the former are reborn as Kṣatriyas, Brahmans, or VaiŚyas, the latter as dogs, pigs, or Caṇḍālas, but the absurdity is retained that the third class remains, described as beings which ever return. 

5

The Kausītaki Upanisad presents an accommodation version: here the souls are all sent to the moon: their knowledge is there tested, and according to the result they proceed by the Devayana leading through the worlds of Agni, Vayu, Varuna, Indra, and Prajapati to that of Brahman, or they return

There are quasi parallels in JB. i. 18 and 49 (Oertel, JAOS. xix. 111 ff.). The path to the moon in the latter version is through the fire, smoke, night, day, waning half of month, waxing half of month, and soul and body unite in the moon or month.

to earth in rebirth as a worm or a fly or a fish or a bird or a lion or a boar or a serpent or a tiger or a man or as something else. The later Upanisads add nothing of value to this doctrine: the Katha 1 refers to the rebirth of men as men or plants according to their deeds and knowledge, and the PraŚna 2 follows the Chandogya with some deviation. It, with the Jaiminiya Upanisad Brāhmaṇa,3 recognizes two ways from the start, one by the north course to the world of Aditya, the other by the south course to the moon, from the former there being no return. The mention of Aditya here is an archaic touch in comparison with the world of Brahman, while on the other hand it is more recent than the conception of the goal as the world of Yama, as in the Rigveda. The Jaiminiya version contains the curious assertion that a man can, after attaining the world of Brahman through the earth, Agni, Vayu, the atmosphere, the quarters, day and night, the half months, the months, the seasons, the year, the heavenly Gandharvas, the Apsarases, the sky, the gods, the sun, the moon, cach of which is the world of Brahman,5 choose at will birth in a Brahman or a Kṣatriya family, a clear proof of a doctrine independent of Karman, and a curious parallel to the Buddhist doctrine-found also in Jainism-of the choice of family made by the Buddha while in the Tusita heaven. In the Bhagavadgita" we find the process carried one degree further and above the world of Brahman, from which once no return was possible, is set that of Kṛṣṇa as all-god. The Mundaka makes the soul attain release by passing through the sun; Hertel's view that release is attained after life in the Brahmaloka seems erroneous; attain- ment of the Brahmaloka is release. 

8 

9 

In keeping with the curious vagueness of the Upanisads is the failure to make it clear precisely what is the ground which secures for a man union with the absolute in lieu of rebirth. In the Chandogya 10 the matter is fairly simple; the boon falls to those who know the doctrine of the five fires and the offerings in them which explain man's descent to earth after his death, and to those who practice worship in the forest, holding that faith is their asceti- cism; at least this is the more natural sense of the terms employed. Return to earth is attributed to those who in the village worship, holding that their sacrifices and their gifts to the priests are their tribute. In the Bṛhadāraṇ- yaka,"1 on the other hand, the distinction is between those who practise faith

and truth, and those who devote themselves to sacrifice, alms, and asceticism. In the Mundaka Upanisad1 the attainment of the absolute is the reward of those who wise, calm, of holy conduct, practise faith and asceticism, which is doubtless intended to be a reproduction of the view of the Chandogya, though its accuracy is dubious. In the PraŚna 2 the sun and the absolute are assured to those who give themselves up to holy conduct (brahmacarya), asceticism, faith, and knowledge, while rebirth is attained by those who hold that sacri- fice and gifts are their action. It may fairly be held that the earlier sources do not accept asceticism as any essential part of the equipment for attaining the absolute, while it is assumed as necessary in the later texts.3 

The nature of the being which passes through transmigration is not specially discussed in the accounts of the paths. The curious mention of the man, variously described as spiritual (mānasa) or as superhuman (amänava), who leads the migrating soul from the lightning to the world of Brahman, is trans- formed by the account of the Nirukta into a change effected in the soul itself, which becomes a spiritual essence, and with this conception Windisch 5 compares the fact that the Buddha emerges in spiritual (manomaya) form from his mother's womb, thus avoiding all injury to her, and the gods assume such a form. No certainty, however, is possible, and Deussen is equally certain that the manasa of the Bṛhadaranyaka version is merely a corruption of the amanava of the Chandogya text.

The nature of the soul which is fated, unlike this class of soul, to return to earth, is not here specifically described in any way, but in another part of the Bṛhadaranyaka Upanisad' we find the description of the fate of the soul on death, from which it appears that all the organs accompany the departing Atman, that it enters into the Samjñana, and so becomes possessed of know- ledge and consciousness, Vijñāna, while, it is added, its learning and actions hold fast to it, and its knowledge of what has been before. With this accords well enough the Buddhist view of the migrating substance which is composed of Vijñāna, and the other four Skandhas of Vedana, 'feeling', Samjñā, ' perception', Rūpa, corporeal form', and Samskāras, 'dispositions', and which also bears the compendious term of Namarupa, 'name and form', the former being essentially a brief designation of the four Skandhas other than form. Here, however, and in the orthodox doctrine of Śankara and the Samkhya, we have express recognition of a factor which is not mentioned expressly at any rate in the Bṛhadaraṇyaka, that of corporeal form. It is

The Doctrine of Transmigration

evident that this view was not absolutely necessary for the theory of the Atman, and its development went, we may assume, hand in hand with the development of the principle of the fine elements of matter, such fine elements being obviously necessary if they were to be conceived as accompanying an invisible entity like a transmigrating soul. We find, however, in the same Upanisad1 in the dialogue between Yajnavalkya and Artabhāga, which is preserved in one tantalizing fragment, that in the case of death a man's speech departs to the fire, his breath to the wind, his eye to the sun, his mind to the moon, his ear to the pole, his body to the earth, his Atman to the ether, his hair to the plants and trees, his blood and sced to the waters, but there remains to transmigrate his Karman alone. It is true that Śañkara proves equal to the occasion and disposes of the mention of the disappearance of the Atman by interpreting the ether as the space in the heart wherein dwells the self, but this explanation is a mere tour de force. On the other hand, Windisch suggests that the necessary element of personality must be deemed to be given by the persistence of the name, which in the preceding section of the Upanisad Yajnavalkya has declared to be the one thing which persists on the death of man, and this interpretation appears to be necessarily correct, while it suggests the origin of the use of the term 'name' in the Buddhist conception of Namarupa as the factor which passes through transmigration. Jacobi, again, suggests that the force of Karman produces a new complex of the elements, holding that the idea of a permanent soul was not yet known, but this is a far-fetched conception. In the vagueness of conception we have nothing to wonder at: the whole conception is seriously regarded so bizarre, that it is not surprising that to clothe it in definite language was beyond the power of the authors of the Upanisads. 

3 

In the later literature 5 there exist, despite the prevalence of the Karman doctrine, none the less the inconsistent ideas that on the one hand the sin of the father passes over to the child, apart from the action of the child in former births, and on the other that the saving grace of the Lord avails to break the chain of Karman. Still more naturally in the period of the Upanisads, when the doctrine of Karman was far from being a fixed dogma, it is not surprising that many traces of conceptions inconsistent with the Karman belief should appear. Of these the most obvious is the belief in the power of the Atman by special grace to manifest itself, which is found in the Katha, the Mundaka, and still more clearly in the CvetāŚvatara Upanisad, but equally important is the doctrine that in the son the father is continued in being in such a manner that the son takes over all that his father has, including his Karman, though 

1 iii. 2. 18. 

In Caraka's Śarirasthāna, iii. 14, the transmigrating element is the Sattva, while in each man self-consciousness, mind, senses, and the breaths are derived from the non-transmigrating self.

[Part V 

the term in the context applies generally to all action and has no moral reference, and that for any evil done by his father the son makes atonement,1 a view which results in the constant insistence on begetting offspring as a religious duty, and which in the later period takes the more crude and vulgar form that the mere birth of a son (putra) saves the father from the hell named Put, a pucrile verbal play in the precise manner of the Upanisads. This idea must clearly be reckoned along with those passages which declare that in the son the father is born again, an idea which is in itself not strictly reconcilable with the view that the soul transmigrates on death, since in the elaborate description of the Upanisads the tradition from father to son is of so complete a kind that it would seem that there was nothing more which could transmi- grate we have in fact three diverse ideas more or less blended, the birth of the father in the production of a son, the handing over by the father on death to the son of his whole personality, and the migration of the father's soul into some new existence. 

A further breach with the theory of Karman is to be seen in the case of the Kausitaki Upanisad, which tells how the man who attains the Brahman after passing by the river of immortality casts away his good and his evil deeds, which his friends and enemies duly share, while he from his lofty position gazes calmly at good and evil deeds, and the contrasts of night and day. This idea, as Hopkins has shown, has a ritual origin: in the Catapatha Brāhmaṇa we are told how the man who performs the Agnihotra after sunset and before sunrise escapes the fate which normally awaits men in the world to come, where the days and the nights gradually destroy their good deeds, and doom them in due course to that renewal of death which the Brahman regards as the worst of unhappinesses. Thus early it is clear the Karman doctrine had to face the competition of conflicting and doubtless older views, which never could be brought into real coincidence with it. 

Another of the many contradictions involved in the theory arises from the view that on the departure of the soul on death it is accompanied by its recognition of the past, that is, that it retains a real personality. The difficulty of disposing of the fact that in practice the soul has no such recollection in its new birth of this previous experience is met by the statement that the child in the womb in its ninth month of existence possesses this knowledge, but through the pangs of birth is deprived of it. The Buddhist view admits that the Buddha enters with complete memory and intelligence into the womb," but in his case his miraculous birth prevents the loss of his supreme powers. 

The later literature, by no means in harmony with the principles of Karman, assumes that great importance attaches to the thought which is in

the mind of man in the moment of death,1 and we find a faint premonition of this view in the insistence laid in the PraŚna Upanisad 2 that man's thought determines his next life. Possibly a similar conception may underlie the prayer put by the IŚa Upanisad 3 in the mouth of the dying man. 

## 11. The Way of Salvation 

In the view of the Buddhist the world is misery, and the whole end of man is to remove the misery of existence from himself by the destruction of that desire, which leads ever from birth to birth. But the wholesale pessimism of the Buddhist is by no means characteristic of the Upanisṣads: to find real pessimism in them, as apart from mild expressions of the unsatisfactoriness of the finite compared with the infinite, is impossible. It is also impossible, therefore, to trace to the empirical despair of the world the growth of pessi- mism; the most that in this regard can be said is that the tendency to take a pessimistic view of life may have been favoured among the upper classes of the Indians by the effect of the climate and admixture with the aborigines, which was steadily taking place and was weakening the mental character of the racc. Of the latter fact there can be no doubt the genius of the Upanisads is different from that of the Rigveda, however many ties may connect the two periods. The emancipation theories of the Upaniṣads must, therefore, be traced to some more intellectual ground. 

In the Rigveda and in the Brāhmaṇas the ideal aimed at is length of days on earth and life in the world of heaven in companionship with the gods. In the Brāhmaṇas we find that the reward of community of being, companion- ship, and fellowship with the gods is promised to the performers of various rites, in the case of diverse gods, Agni most of all, but also Vayu, Indra, Varuna, Aditya, Bṛhaspati, Prajapati, and finally even with the impersonal Brahman. The gods are then reduced to the position of being no more than means by which entry to the Brahman can be obtained, and even Agni is placed in this position as well as Indra and Prajapati. When the Brahman is also regarded as the Atman, the end becomes unity with the Atman, and this was the saving mode of emancipation, before transmigration was believed in. The knower of the wise long-cmancipated youthful Atman ceases to fear death; the finder of the Atman ceases to be stained by action; knowledge leads to the place where desire is at rest, where no sacrificial gift reaches, nor

the penance of the ignorant. It is clear that what is contemplated is attain- ing by knowledge union with the Brahman, but the influence of the traditional view is seen in the fact that it is still regarded as the arrival at a world of heaven as if the Atman were without the self. The same conflict appears in the view that the Atman is the infinitely great and the infinitely small, and that on the departure of the soul, it is to go to the Atman, and enter in. In all these passages it is necessary to recognize that the knowledge of the Atman leads only to unity with the Atman after death, and that the unity is conceived on the old model of community with a deity. 

9 

A further and important step is undoubtedly taken with the recognition of the fact that the emancipation desired is already achieved in this life by means of the recognition of the fact of the unity of the self and the absolute. He who knows 'I am the Brahman' becomes the universe: even the gods have no power to prevent him so becoming, for he is its soul. Or, in the words of the Mundaka Upanisad,5 He who knows the supreme Brahman becomes the Brahman." The mere knowledge constitutes the deliverance: the man ceases to be affected by any desires of any kind: his deeds good or bad cease to have any effect on him: like the recd stalk in the fire, his works consume themselves away: 7 as water does not stay on the lotus leaf, further works do not cling to him. The discussions of Yajnavalkya with the king, Janaka, reveal the truth that the absence of desire, the disappearance of every passion," is the mark of the man becoming immortal and attaining to the Brahman. Similarly, in veiled language he informs the king that death will not produce any essential change in the self, and he denies in his discussion with Maitreyi that there is any consciousness after death." Though later interpreted materialistically by the Carvākas, the sense is clearly otherwise. After death the indestructible self ceases to have that division of consciousness as subject and object, which gives the empirical consciousness of the world. The wise know that there is in the universe as we have it no reality, nor is there any further reality in immortality, if understood as a prolonged individual exis- tence after death. 

10 

The attainment of emancipation by this knowledge which gives it, and is it, results in the immediate cessation of every emotion: how can man desire any-

thing who knows himself to be all? How can he fear when there is no other? There can be no sorrow for him nor pain: he is like a blind man who has gained his sight, a wounded man healed, a sick man made whole. All his works are annihilated, as they have meaning only for an individuality. Future works have no effect upon him, but evil he cannot wish to do, since he has no desires: he may, if he cares, live on for the full length of life or do any action so long as he does it disinterestedly, a view which the IŚa Upanisad offers, despite its paradoxical appearance, doubtless as a sop to those who did not wish to be denied the position of emancipation, but preferred also to enjoy the things of life. He cannot again ever feel any doubt; 2 he has the full and abiding knowledge for all time. 

The view that the emancipation is attained in the moment of the know- ledge is, however, very far from being universally expressed or believed. The idea on the contrary occurs, ever and again, that the result of the enlighten- ment is only complete at the end of the life of the self, and that the enlighten- ment takes the form of an alteration in space to a new abode. These ideas arc, of course, mercly the ideas regarding the fate of the soul, transferred to the new conception of the gaining of knowledge. The view that the attainment of knowledge brought release was one, which, we may safely assume, was not easy to grasp or to hold, for the very good reason that it is as a matter of fact unintelligible. Hence the Upanisads as a rule merely consider that the advantages of the acquisition of knowledge are the winning of the desired immortality: the view of the merger of the Atman in the Atman as a mere recognition of identity is not the conception usually found, which is rather that the reward is eternity. Thus in the Katha Upanisad, in which has been seen the doctrine of final release by Deussen, there is no trace, as Whitney 4 has clearly pointed out, of anything more than the mere recognition of the winning of immortality as the result of knowledge, in this case philosophical knowledge, not as in the Taittiriya Brāhmaṇa, from which the conception of the Upanisad is borrowed, ritual knowledge. So we have many other accounts, all of the same kind: the soul is supposed to go out by the veins to the rays of the sun and to the sun; in the accounts in the transmigration doctrine the souls even of the men who have acquired knowledge are conceived as going by a long journey to the world of Brahman and the same idea is repeated in the variant versions of the Kausītaki Upanisad where from the moon such souls go by the worlds of fire, wind, Varuna, Indra, Prajapati and then reach Brahman. In the Aitareya Aranyaka we learn

[Part V 

that Vamadeva, as a result of knowing the Atman, ascended from this world, and attained immortality in yonder world of heaven. The Kauṣitaki also has an account in detail of the world of Brahman, with the Aparajita palace, which is derived from Varuna's Rigvedic abode, the tree Ilya, the Sãālajya city, and the sea Ara, the later conception being perhaps derived from the seas, Ara and Nya, in the world of Brahman invented by the Chandogya Upanisad.1 Yet another version makes the emancipated man be separated from the non- emancipated by the fact that at death his soul goes out by the 101st vein,2 whence he proceeds by the crown of the head, fire, wind, and sun up to Brah- man. All these are proofs of the perfectly simple meaning given to saving knowledge by the Upanisads generally. The knowledge might really confer the enlightenment in the view of a few minds, but the overwhelming opinion 3 of the age was that the reward was the heaven in one form or another. The later Vedanta endeavoured to bring order into these ideas, and reconcile them with the real nature of emancipation by the theory of the contrast between the Jivanmukta, who obtains release in perfection only on death, but who is really released in life by his attainment of knowledge, and the subject of the progressive emancipation, Kramamukti, by which the passage to the world of Brahman took place before the final release by the attainment of complete insight, but these devices remain as unnatural as possible.5 

## 12. The Ethics of the Upanisads and Yoga 

In comparison with the intellectual activity of the Brahmans the ethical content of the Upanisads must be said to be negligible and valueless. The total impression conveyed by the Upanisads is that of an intellectual exercise, whose aim was the attainment partly of immediate goods, partly of the highest good, normally the happiness of heaven which was often materially enough conceived, and there is made no attempt to make the theoretical philosophy a ground of morality of any sort. There are, here and there, moral maxims enunciated, but these are of no consequence and rise in no way above popular morality. On the contrary, the essential fact is expressed by Indra in his dialogue with Pratardana: the possession of knowledge makes a man independent of all morality, the slaying of an embryo, the murder of a

father or of a mother. It is, of course, true that these statements are not meant seriously, and that we may console ourselves by supposing that the priest did not hold that these crimes could really be disposed of in this way, though of that we cannot be certain as the same results can be attained by ritual practices. But they must have felt an exaggerated value to attach to their speculations, and have completely failed to see that morality is the most objective and essential part of philosophy, and is something other than sacrificial activity or intellectual gymnastics.

Here and there we have views which are sound so far as they go; the allegory of life1 as a Soma sacrifice postulates that the fee shall be asceticism, liberality, right dealing, non-injury to life, and truthfulness, and a list of a student's duties is given in the Taittiriya Upanisad. The student is bidden by his teacher not to be negligent of truth, virtue, welfare, prosperity, study and teaching, and in due course propagation of children. Further, duties to the gods, the Fathers, and parents are inculcated, and teachers and guests are to be ranked as gods. Those acts which are irreproachable alone should be practised, and good deeds alone should be revered. Refreshments with a seat should be provided for deserving Brahmans. Giving is regulated; 3 one should give with faith, one should not give without faith, one should give with plenty, with modesty, with fear, with sympathy. Further, a very useful practical rule is enjoined; if the student has doubt concerning an act or conduct, then recourse should be had to the attitude of Brahmans, competent to judge, apt, devoted, not harsh, lovers of virtue; as they behave themselves in such a case, so should the student demean himself, and similarly should he act in regard to persons who are spoken against. There is thus given as the norm of conduct the average righteous man, who embodies in himself the standard of action. In the same Upanisad 5 in addition to the essential study and teaching a further list is given which runs: right dealing, truthfulness, asceticism, self-restraint, tranquility, maintenance of the sacred fire, the offering of the Agnihotra, hospitality, courtesy, and duties to children, wives, and grandchildren. Another text secs in the voice of the thunder the rules 'Be restrained, liberal, merciful'. So we have condemned as sinners the stealer of gold, the drinker of Sura, the murderer of a Brahman, and the defiler of his teacher's bed, and their associates," while AŚvapati, the prince, boasts that his kingdom has no thief, churl, or drunkard, none who neglect the sacrifice or the sacred lore, no adulterer or courtesan.8 This is, it is clear, purely elementary: the failure to rise to the conception even of a system of ethics is a sign not so much, as Deussen suggests, of the virtue of the age,

which is not proved by any other evidence, but rather of the lack of ethical sense on the part of the Brahmans. Philosophically also the doctrine of the absolute as all-pervading resulted in the negation of human responsibility: it is the deity who really acts in and through man, and the latter cannot be blamed for what he thus seemingly does.1 

4 

In truth the aims of the Brahmans were bent on things which are not ethical at all, immediate profit on the one hand, or, on the other, the closer realization of the absolute in which they believed, and which they desired to appreciate in full enjoyment. The ideal is embodied in the most curious forms. Knowledge in the Upanisads is essentially profitable, and by no means for spiritual ends alone. He who knows the world as fivefold obtains it; he who knows Indra as without a rival has no rival; the possessor of knowledge cannot be injured by an enemy; neither the northern nor the southern mountains can prevail against him, and his foes die around him, an idea found in the Aitareya Brahmaṇa. It is an easy step to the result already seen; knowledge obliterates evil; one who knows may consort with even the murderer without being contaminated. With a strange contrast to Sokrates who held that the wise man would necessarily be good, we are repeatedly assured that knowledge relieves man from worrying as to whether he has done wrong or right in any matter. Entry into the absolute is accompanied by the casting aside of good and evil deeds, which are transferred on one view to one's relatives or foes respectively. With an anticipation of modern idealism, and in the true spirit of mysticism, good and bad may be regarded as imperfect concepts for which there is no proper place in the absolute; if speech were not, neither right nor wrong, true nor false, good nor bad, pleasant nor unpleasant, could be known. The absolute self is unsullied by evil to which he is external; an etymology proves it; for he is called the person, Puruşa, since he burned (us) up evil before (pürva) all these worlds." In uniting with him the individual parts utterly from good or bad." We see this even in sleep, for in it neither evil nor good attaches itself effectively to the self.10 When we are told" that the world is truth, there is no ethical implication, for it is plain that there is here merely an assertion of the reality of the universe, the word Satya conveying both senses, and in the theistic ŚvetäŚvatara 12 the description of the lord as the bringer of right and the remover of evil is due to the confusion, there constant, between the personal deity and the absolute. The emancipated self possesses autonomy, but it is not an ethical

state; it is merely a condition of unhindered power, the ideal of a despot, the state of the man who goes up and down these worlds, eating what he desires, assuming what form he desires.2 

Prajapati utterly condemns the doctrine, derived allegedly from his teaching by the demon Virocana, which asserts that the man who consults his own desires in this life obtains both this world and the world to come; this view is described as devilish, naturally enough since it would have turned all against gifts to the priests or sacrifice. But we have instead the clear doctrine that the self is dearer even than a son, and that whatever is dear, be it wife, sons, wealth, the Brahman class, the Kṣatriya class, the gods, worlds, any- thing, is dear not for itself, but for the sake of the self or soul. We have here, not the psychological theory that things are desired for their pleasure, not for themselves, nor the suggestion that all love is ultimately self-love, but the recognition of the fact of the unity of the whole, which finds its truth in the self. Plainly, however, there is no attempt to develop a positive morality 5 which would render empiric selfishness wrong on the score that it was based on a false distinction between self and not-self. On the contrary we find only emphasized throughout the necessity of caring for one's own salvation; Yajnavalkya abandons his faithful wives to seek the welfare of his soul, just as the Buddha abandons his young bride and his child, because they are hin- drances to the attainment of relcase. 

The truc ideal, therefore, of the seeker for truth is embodied in the practice of asceticism and the adoption of renunciation: by turning away from the things of this world, and by concentrating unnaturally the mind on the object, the vision beatific was to be obtained: the utter incompatibility of this with the purely intellectual view, that the recognition of the Brahman as the self was emancipation, is obvious, but contradictions in adjecto are the normal characteristic of the Upanisads. Hence was developed the scheme by which the old rule of life was complicated and a series of four AŚramas, 'places of asceticism', was devised, through which the man should pass on his way to his home in the heaven. 

In the earliest Upanisads we find only the conception that, beside the life of the student and the householder, men might give themselves up to ascetic practices in their seeking for the truth. There was no idea that the stages of life should be successive, ending with the ascetic stage: the ascetic stage. might follow the stage of household life if desired, but equally it might not." But in the later Upanisads, such as the Jabala', we find the four stages ordered

as student, householder, anchorite, Vanaprastha, and finally wandering beggar, Parivrājaka, Bhiksu. The first two stages remain much as in the Brahmana period it is of interest that we hear of cases, where a pupil seems to have been used by his alleged teacher mainly for the purpose of tending his cattle, in return for which the teaching might be long delayed, as in the case of Satya- kāma.1 Other pupils again were deemed unworthy of the teaching they desired Upakosala tended the fires for twelve years without his teacher making up his mind to trust him with the sacred knowledge. The householder may still attain the world of Brahman by attention to his duties, if he con- tinues to study and brings up pious sons and pupils, subduing his organs in the self and slaying no life, save at the sacrificial ground. But another view condemns such persons to life in the moon, and then to return to earth again. Sacrifice, Veda study, liberality, and the production of sons are still the chief duties, though, as we have seen, the tendency was growing to reduce the sacrifice to symbolic acts. 

6 

The late Vaikhanasa Dharmasūtra lays down that there are four categories of householder. The first (värttāvṛtti) devotes himself to the duty of agricul- ture, cattle rearing or trade. The second (Śalīna) performs regularly the domestic offerings, Pakayajñas, and, after establishing his fire, carries out cach fortnight the new and full moon offerings, and every four months the four-month offerings, as well as twice a year the animal offering, and once the Soma offering. The third (yāyāvara) performs the Crauta sacrifices, including the Soma sacrifice, for himself and also acts as priests for others, whence his name of Wanderer'; he studies and teaches pupils; he gives and accepts gifts; he maintains his fire and entertains guests. The fourth (ghoräcärika) is a man of severe observances, for he offers Iştis, studies and gives gifts, practising specially rigorous abstinence in the months MargaŚīrṣa and Jyaistha, performing morning and evening the Agnihotra, and maintaining the fire with fruits of the wood. We need not suppose that this ideal scheme corre- sponded to any very definite practice; it is noteworthy that it recognizes that in many cases the householder was more busied in his business than in the per- formance of his domestic ritual. 

The business of teaching 3 was doubtless carried on by many of the house- holders, as well as by those who had passed this stage. For the early Vedic period we have no indication of anything corresponding to the later Math, where large bodies of teachers and pupils were united in a loose form of monastic life. We seem to find nothing more than individual teachers attract- ing a larger or smaller number of pupils; the ideal seems to have been that a true student must dwell in his teacher's house (anteväsin), and this fact alone would negative large bodies. The epic tradition seems to suggest that five was a maximum. From this simple relationship may be explained a dominant feature of the Buddhist and later monastic system, the free right of any person

who had entered on a course of study to abandon it. The development of monastic systems which soon became common to all sects was furthered by the rise of Buddhism, though it need not be held to have been a specific Buddhist innovation, for it may easily have risen spontaneously among Buddhists Jains and Brahmans alike as the outcome of their competition for public favour. 

2 

The third stage, that of the anchorite, is not distinguished by Yajñavalkya from that of the wanderer: when he decides to give up the life of the house- holder he contemplates wandering about as a beggar.1 The value of penance for the knowledge of the Brahman is not overestimated in the oldest Upanisads: the king Bṛhadratha, after most painful mortification, is still far from attaining the desired knowledge. Asceticism, it is even said, leads only to the way of the Fathers, and has not the result of future emancipation. The man who really realizes the Brahman is above the AŚramas; he has realized all that is aimed at by asceticism; he has no longer individuality or family con- nexion, he wanders about homeless, begging, without possessions, and bears the name Sannyasin, the renouncer of everything. How this ideal can be logically derived from knowledge of the Atman is nowhere explained in the Upanisads. 

With the usual curious turns of Indian thought the Sannyasin, who is really a person beyond the AŚramas as the Ś'vetaŚvatara Upanisad calls him, becomes in the later Upanisads a man striving for the knowledge of the Atman by means of asceticism. He should undertake this stage only as a rule after being a forest hermit, though he may enter into it direct from the house- holder's state. He parts solemnly after sacrifice from all his kin, abandons all sacrifice for ever, gives up the sacred cord and the tonsure, lays aside his former garments and his staff, is clad in rags and a loincloth, and wanders about save at the period of the rains, living on what he begs and inhabiting lonely spots some texts even demand nudity: he bears now a triple staff or a single staff, to signify perhaps the reconciliation of caste differences. Only one night may he live in a village, five in a town, but in the four months of the rains he may stay there. He is to recite Upanisads and the Aranyaka, to meditate, perform bathings, be indifferent to every human emotion, and show charity to all creatures. He must practise Yoga, that is, exercises intended to bring the mind into mystic union with the absolute. Though the system of the later Yoga,5 which is linked to the Samkhya, and which, therefore, in theory aims really primarily at the isolation of the spirit and nature, not at union with the divinity, is not found set out in the same precise detail, most

of its elements can be traced in the Upanisads,1 and in the Katha we are dis- tinctly told that it is necessary to suppress speech and mind, merging the latter in the knowledge self, that in the great self, and that in the calm self, the absolute. The highest stage is attained when the five senses cease to give knowledge, when the mind and the intellect are at rest; the firm restraint of the senses is Yoga. The CvetaŚvatara devotes its second chapter to the praise of Yoga, prefacing it with prayers, adapted from the Taittiriya Samhitā, in which the aid of Savity is invoked to secure the application of the mind to the task set before the Yogin. He should hold erect his body, and cause his senses and mind to enter into the heart, check his movements, and breathe with diminished intensity through the nose, restraining from distraction his mind. A clean level spot, free from pebbles, fire or gravel, favourable to thought by the presence of water, not offensive to the eye, protected from the wind and secluded, is recommended. Fog, smoke, sun, fire, wind, fireflies, lightning, crystal, the moon, are given as the preliminary appearances which present themselves to the Yogin; lightness, healthiness, steadiness or freedom from desire, clearness of countenance, pleasantness of voice, sweetness of odour, and scantiness of excretions are the first stage in his progress. revelation of the absolute procures freedom from fetters and sorrow; sickness, old age, and death are overcome. The Upanisad, however, does not rely on Yoga alone; the one is attainable not by Yoga merely but by reflection (sāṁkhya) also, terms in which we need not see references to established schools, as does Oldenberg.2 The insistence on breathing as a matter of im- portance is noteworthy; restraint of breath not merely banishes evil influences, it tends to generate heat, thus producing Tapas, and by restraint serves to deaden the activity of the brain, thus favouring the feeling of severance from the world and union with the absolute.

The 

The Maitrāyaṇīya repeatedly develops the theme; the state to be aimed at is reaching the fourth stage, by the suppression of the living self. By pressing the tip of the tongue against the palate," by suppressing voice, mind, and breath, one sees the Brahman, the self, and becomes selfless. Another device, forming the beginning of an advance by sound to the absolute without sound, consists in closing the ears with the thumbs, when the sound of the ether within the heart becomes audible. By the suppression of breath the light of the ether within the heart is made manifest." Or again by using the sound Om as an arrow, with mind as its point, the Yogin pierces the darkness and sees him who sparkles like a wheel of fire, the colour of the sun, the Brah-

man that shines beyond the darkness, in the sun, the moon, the fire, and the lightning. The oneness of the breath and mind and also of the senses and the relinquishment of all conditions of existence is declared to be Yoga.

These 

are Prāṇāyāma, regulation of the breathing out and in', Pratyahāra, suppression of the organs of sense such as the mind, so as to prevent its activity spoiling concentration, Dhyana, meditation', Dharaṇā, 'concentra- tion of the attention', Tarka, reflection', a term of doubtful sense in this context, and Samadhi, absorption or complete union with the object of meditation. This list differs, in the insertion of Tarka, and in the placing of Dhyana before Dharaṇā, from the later list, which makes up the number of eight members by inserting as the first three items Yama, discipline', refraining from doing injury, truthfulness, &c., Niyama,' self-restraint' such as purity, contentment, &c., and Asana, postures in sitting'. Of all these the most important is the use of Om as a symbol of Brahman to meditate upon. It is recognized by the Katha, but its importance belongs to the later Upanisads, which delight in mystery regarding it; it has three syllables or morae, or three and a half, or three morae and three echoes, three morae and four half morae, and so on; the point of the Anusvära is given a hidden sense and the echo is also famed. It is refreshing to find that silence is called the highest point of all.5 The view then is that man can only enter on the medita- tion with Om: he must at the end attain the nothingness in that which is not a word, like the sap of the flowers in the liquid honey. In the condition of Samadhi the consciousness of a separate subject and object entirely disappears, and the state of selflessness is reached. This union is attained by the ascent of the soul, from the heart through the Susumņā vein and the Brahmarandhra, to union with the absolute." Naturally this conception is developed with the aid of the metaphor by which the heart is called a lotus, and by the use of the veins, 72,000 in number, into wild fantasies. Yet, though most of this absurdity is found in the later Upanisads, it should be recognized that the needs of Asana are hinted at in the CvetäŚvatara," and the virtues of Praty- āhāra are recognized by the Chandogya." 

Religious suicide, which we have not seen in the Brahmaņa period, is mentioned in this, but only at the latest stage, long after the period of the Upanisads proper, when authority is given to the beggar to abstain from food, to throw himself into the water or fire, 10 to choose a hero's death. Strange folly to emerge from the comparative rationalism of the Upanisads, and to reach its apotheosis in the religion of the Jina.

The Philosophy of the Veda 

[Part V 

## 13. The Significance of the Philosophy of the Upanisads What judgement are we to pass on the main thought of the Upanisads? Are they really the expressions at an early date of the deepest principles of philosophy, or are they merely of historical value, interesting pictures of the early thought of man, important not per se, but because of their dominating influence on the future philosophy and life of India? The two interpreters, who have of recent times been most impressed by the nature of that philosophy as idealism, have passed the most diametrically opposed views on the question: Gough was impressed with the necessity of explaining the defects of the subject of which he treated by the admixture of blood among the Indians, and the corrupting influences of a low order of civilization, while Deussen is lost in admiration of the Upanisads, as was Schopenhauer before him: 'Eternal philosophical truth', he says, 'has seldom found more decisive and striking expression than in the doctrine of the emancipating knowledge of the Atman.' He claims that Yajñavalkya had anticipated the view of Schopenhauer regarding immortality as indestructibility without continued existence; he regards the view of the nature of the self as an anticipation of the doctrine of Kant; he defends the doctrine of transmigration as the best expression of the true state of matters in the terms of empirical thought, while recognizing that such an expression is misleading: nay, he argues that the Kantian argument regarding immortality, based on the realization of the moral law within us, points not to ordinary immortality, but rather to the process of transmigra- tion, and transmigration has been solemnly upheld as philosophic doctrine at the present time by competent authorities. 

3 

The position of Deussen is, of course, coloured by his acceptance of the view that Kant has finally shown that the knowledge of the ultimate reality is not possible, with which he combines the Schopenhauerian doctrine of the primacy of the will which he traces to Christianity, and his view of the Upani- şads is, therefore, greatly determined by his double desire, to find in them the anticipation of Kant and to show that the views of Kant, as modified by Schopenhauer, are the only possible views of philosophy. To those who do. not accept his theories the arguments adduced by him fall with the theories themselves, but the investigation of this question belongs to a general philoso- phical discussion, which is hardly here necessary or appropriate. The more important question which arises is to what extent the doctrines of the Upani- ṣads do foreshadow the views of Kant.

Contrast the judgement of Lanman (Beginnings of Ilindu Pantheism, p. 24): 'What a prospect, dark and void-this Supreme Spirit, before whom all human endeavour, all noble ambition, all hope, all love, is blighted! What a contrast, a relief, when we turn from this to the teachings of the gentle Nazarene !'

Bradley, The Principles of Logic (1922) E. Cassirer, Das Erkenntnisproblem. 

Chap. 28] Significance of the Philosophy of the Upanisads 

593 

The answer to this question must candidly admit that the conception of the Upanisads formed by Deussen as containing a definite doctrine of idealism, that of Yajnavalkya, which is variously broken down by realistic intrusions, and accommodations to common-sense, is one which is contrary to all pro- bability and reason. The ideas of Yājñavalkya, that is of the men who framed and attributed to his famous name those views, are the high-water mark of the speculation of the Upanisads: the rest of the material is merely the natural development of the Brāhmaṇa theories. Those theories arc of historic interest: as philosophy, they are unworthy of a moment's considera- tion. On the other hand the views of Yajnavalkya do certainly go the length of asserting the unknowableness of the subject and the fact that the Atman, the subject matter of the philosophy of the age, was the knowing subject within the man it is further clear that he maintained that the Atman was the only real thing, and that plurality was illusory. It is quite true that even in the section attributed to him there are many expressions which will not harmonize with this conception, but it would be unfair not to take the doctrines at their face value, and to recognize that we cannot reasonably expect full consistency on these matters. It is, therefore, necessary to consider these doctrines in themselves in their value for thought. 

The essential result appears to lie in this, that the distinction of subject and object is realized, and that, with the recognition of this distinction, it is seen that, as such, the subject cannot possibly be an object of thought or knowledge. These propositions are perfectly true, if duly confined to what they assert: consciousness essentially involves the distinction of subject and object, and clearly it is impossible to make the subjective activity an object of knowledge in exactly the same sense as the content of that activity is an object of know- ledge.1 But with this doctrine we make little progress to the understanding of the world, and the theory that it was really an anticipation of the view that the thing-in-itself is unknowable is not supported by any evidence whatever. On the contrary, the assertion of the unity of the self and the denial of plurality cannot be deduced on any legitimate manner from the doctrine so far arrived at, and these theories amount to no more than the desire to arrive at the con- ception of some permanent and abiding thing. But the identity of the self and the absolute is based merely on the abstraction of the self as subjectivity, and that of the absolute as subjectivity, and the identity is therefore meaning- less and a merc matter of words. 

Moreover the utter difference between Yajnavalkya and Kant appears clearly when we realize that Yajnavalkya, with his theory of the unity of the 

1 For the later views on this point cf. Keith, JRAS. 1916, pp. 371, 372. The real problem of individuality is, of course, merely stated, not solved by this con- trast. The question is, What is the ex- planation of the quasi-permanence of the knowing subject? No Indian 

18 [H.0.8. 32] 

philosophy deals with this effectively; Buddhism, if we believe C. Rhys Davids (JRAS. 1908, pp. 587 ff.), has not even the courage to face the pro- blem. For an attempt to restate the Buddhist view of rebirth, see her Buddhist Psychology, pp. 244-68.

The Philosophy of the Veda 

[Part V 

absolute, has no theory at all of the relation of the empiric world to the absolute, i. e. that he really leaves the whole question of philosophy unsolved, and that the followers of his theory were at the last forced to fall back, as early as the CvetāŚvatara Upanisad, on the mere phrase of Māyā, 'illusion", which turns the supreme lord into a conjurer.1 The Kantian doctrine, it need hardly be said, leaves us with the whole empiric world regulated under definite principles in time and space, and subject to causality, and it merely assures us that behind these relations we must not expect by intellectual means to find the meaning of existence. That meaning, however, it finds in the moral consciousness, which then becomes of infinite importance. In the doctrine of Yajnavalkya on the contrary we have nothing save denial of all real causality and multiplicity, and on the other the normal cosmogonism of the Brahmaņas. Of moral principles Yajnavalkya's main text is entirely innocent: the pure intellectuality of his doctrine led to the consequence that the moral acts of the person who had knowledge were indifferent, a fact which no sophistry could conceal and which was recognized at an early date: 2 it has its precise counterpart in the view, prevalent in the Middle Ages in Europe as in India, that devotion to God or an idol was enough to wipe out any infamies. 

When we pass to the doctrine of Karman, the hopeless inconsistencies of the view of Yajnavalkya become painfully obvious: the doctrine of Karman is now introduced as explaining the nature of man's fate in life, without regard to the other doctrine that knowledge means emancipation at once. How on the theory of Yajnavalkya conduct could have any effect at all, or any bearing on the matter, cannot be understood, but it is really incomprehensible how Deussen can accept the view that the knowledge of the unity of the Atman produces liberation. All the effect of the philosophy of Yajñavalkya is to declare the difference of subject and object, and then to assert that the Atman is one, in which there is no difference of subject and object, and there- fore no consciousness, and these views do not show any connexion with emancipation or transmigration by degree of merit of conduct. It is simply inconceivable why on the ground of such theoretic knowledge men should abandon the desire for children, should give up their property, and wander about like beggars, practising a foolish asceticism. Nor as a matter of fact can we imagine that any such conception normally entered the heads of the ascetics of the Vedic age: they doubtless deemed, as the texts indeed show, that what they would attain by these practices was the mystic contemplation of the 

1 Hence in Mahayana Buddhism we reach the logical result that all knowledge is falling away from truth and reality and its suppression is essential; cf. Schayer, Mahāyānistische Erlösungs- lehre, p. 49; Asanga, Sūtrālaṁkāra in ZII. ii. 103 ff.

divine which mystics of every time and clime have aimed at winning.1 This fact, which is clearly proved by the evidence of the many passages in which union with the absolute is aimed at, and regarded as a state of abiding bliss, is not in any degree compatible with the view that what the priests and sages of the Upanisads believed in was the mere fact that there existed a thing in itself, which was for ever unknowable. From such premises no such con- clusions as are drawn by the Upanisads could possibly be derived at any time. The essence of the doctrine of the Upanisads must be looked for in some- thing else. 

Nor indeed is there the slightest doubt as to what that belief was, apart from occasional flashes of insight which led to other conclusions. The absolute is conceived as an ideal, with which unity is as ardently desired, as it was desired in earlier times with the gods in heaven, and the unity with the absolute is conceived in the same mode as unity with the divine had been conceived. The Upanisads are essentially pantheistic with a strong theistic leaning, but the extent of that theism differs from passage to passage, and in the case of Yajnavalkya and others doubtless a still more intellectual view of the situation was taken, in which the chief stress was laid on the conception of the Atman as the one and only reality, free from pollution, serene, unalterable, far above empirical being, or thought of any kind. But this cool intellec- tualism is not by any means the pervading doctrine of the Upanisads, nor indeed in the record of Yajñavalkya's views are we without indication that the Atman itself inspired devotion of a marked kind, as comes out plainly in his address to Maitreyi, on deciding to abandon his goods and his wives and wander forth into the wilderness.3 For most of his contemporaries, who devoted themselves to the study of philosophy, it may confidently be believed that they were pantheists, who were delighted with their discovery of this as the truth of the universe, and who conceived the fate of the enlightened soul as the enjoyment of bliss in the existence to come in union with the one essence of the world. 

2 

It is these two aspects of the Upanisads which explain the two diverse interpretations which, as we have seen, Śankara, following Gauḍapada and some Aupaniṣada school on the one hand, and Badarāyaṇa, doubtless with another Aupaniṣada school, on the other, placed on the Upanisads. The purely negative character of the universe of experience is insisted upon by Śankara as a result of the stress laid on the unknowability of the Atman, and

of Plotinus and of the Vedanta is some- times (as by Lassen, Ind. Alt. iii. 379 ff.; Garbe, Phil. of Anc.

its separation from all empirical reality, while Bādarāyaṇa takes the more simple view, which sees in the absolute a divine nature, and finds a place for the world and the souls beside that nature, though still in some degree pantheistically regarded as part of the divine. The result of truc knowledge as the attainment of union with the supreme deity is thus much more casily brought into concord with the utterances of the Upanisads themselves. Moreover, the sense of devotion to the absolute was thus brought into accord with metaphysical reality and at the same time opportunity given to adapt the Visņu worship of the masses to the esoteric side of the philosophy of the Upanisads, a task carried out by Rāmānuja in his great commentary on the Brahma Sutra.2 

From the point of view of ethics the demerits of the system of the Upani- şads are even more glaring than from the point of view of the intellect. It is doubtless impossible to arrive at certainty on questions of the ultimate nature of reality, but it is an easier matter to establish some principles of moral obligation, and to bring them into harmony with a scheme of the universe which if theoretical shall none the less be at any rate plausible. The defect of the Upanisads is that they render morality in the ultimate issue valueless and meaningless. We may reasonably assume that any complete metaphysic must seek to explain as essential ingredients of existence, truth, goodness, and beauty, and we may safely conclude that a system, which, like that of the Upanisads, regards beauty and goodness as nothing but hollow mockeries, is defective and essentially unsound in its theoretic basis. 

It might indeed seem at first sight that the doctrine of Yajnavalkya which ascribes results to the action of Karman, would supply us with a ground for morality, and the Buddhist system has indeed been praised 3 as an ingenious effort to establish a rigid rule of moral order in the world and to negate selfish- ness by maintaining the doctrines that there is no real self on the one hand, and that every action is causally determined by some previous action on the other. Even, however, in the case of Buddhism the theory is by no means satisfactory or convincing. The conception of Karman serves indeed in an excellent way to defend and protect the established order of things, but it is essentially fatalistic, and fatalism is not for a normal mind a good incentive to moral progress. If, on the one hand, the doing of an evil deed is restrained by the thought that it will be punished in another life, it is equally true that reflec- tion shows that the actor has really no option in his acts and is an absolutely predetermined person, whose former acts produce his present motives and reasonings without the possibility of intervention of any kind on his part. This fatalism haunts the Vedanta and the Samkhya no less than the Buddhist system and practically every modern system of absolute idealism, and it is

noteworthy that in the doctrine of Rāmānuja there is a real effort to find some place for independence on the part of the individual soul, just as in Buddhism. and Jainism alike free will is often tacitly assumed as existing. Again, while in the occidental systems of absolute idealism there is ever an effort to find real value for the individual by seeing in him the conscious working of the absolute which realizes itself in some degree of reality in him, in Buddhism no such satisfaction is possible. We are indeed sometimes 1 invited to see in the Buddhists of the Pāli texts lovers of empirical pyschology and hedonists who believed that life of a certain kind, the full and perfect efflorescence of mind and character on earth, was fair and lovely beyond all non-being, beyond all after-being. Unhappily in this view we have merely the ascription to Bud- dhism of ideals cherished by a modern sect, in flagrant defiance of the obvious fact that the summum bonum of the system envisaged by these writers was precisely non-being, for in death alone have unhealthy moral conditions completely passed away for ever from a sage. From such an end the only deduction bearing upon action must obviously be the rule of avoiding passion and emotion and action of every kind, and it is significant that the develop- ment of the doctrine of active compassion in the Buddhist faith is coincident with the development of the religious aspect of that belief, which in effect overthrows entirely the old ideal and which in large measure was accomplished during foreign dominion in India under the stress of spreading the Buddhist gospel beyond the narrow bounds of India proper. 

In the case of the Upanisads, however, the position for morality is still less favourable than in the Buddhist system. It is quite impossible to make Karman the leading principle of these texts, to many of which it was clearly a sealed book. Moreover it is quite impossible to make the Karman doctrine harmonize with the doctrine of salvation by knowledge, and this doctrine is superior to all morality. Doubtless, when restricted within the narrow circles in which it first became recognized as the fundamental truth, the doctrine of salvation by knowledge alone was not likely to produce evil living, but the effect of a doctrine, which makes morality negligible, on less trained minds can easily be recognized, and is admirably illustrated by the effect of the doctrine of faith when divorced from works. But more directly and funda- mentally the system failed wholly to provide, just as the Buddhist failed to provide, a criterion for morality, since for it also the summum bonum had no intelligible relation to moral activity of any sort. On the contrary it declared the world of reality to be a delusion or at least not true reality and to be

miserable; it encouraged the declaration of one Upanisad1 that devotion to children, wife, or parents is a means of keeping back the self from its saving knowledge it drove Yajnavalkya to abandon his dear wife for ever, and not, as in the more sympathetic version of the Buddha legend, subject to the possibility of relations of friendship at a later period. The essence of its. doctrine is that of the saving of the individual soul, which must resolutely refuse to allow itself to be blinded by the ordinary desires and sympathies of mankind. This is a logical conclusion of the metaphysic of the system. When Yajnavalkya 2 declares that the husband is dear to the wife not for his own sake but for the sake of the self, and applies the same principle to the other relations of human life, to the wife, to children, to riches, to other men, to the gods, and the universe, he is doubtless concerned mainly with a metaphysical doctrine; but not only is the selfish conclusion obvious to ordinary minds, but it is essentially connected with the teaching itself, for on ultimate analysis the aim of the self turns out to be the annihilation of every human desire and activity, an ideal which renders all active philanthropy idle, and which has caused the chief virtues of India to take the form of resignation, passive compassion, and charity."

On the other hand, the attainment of the ideal of union with the absolute led to the addiction to the practise of meditation, and above all in ever in- creasing measure in later times to the seeking of mystic states of absorption in the absolute. It is right to recognize that of this tendency on its worst side the Upanisads have very little to show. It is an exception when the Chan- dogya Upanisad 5 solemnly assures us that the possession of saving knowledge enables a man to have at pleasure the presence of the Fathers, the Mothers, brothers, sisters, friends, garlands, perfumes, music, and women: doubtless in some degree concession had to be made to the desires of those who, unlike Naciketas, preferred material joys and the houris of paradise to the know- ledge of the truth of the fate of man after death. But it was inevitable that a doctrine, which regarded morality as not really existent, and preached the attainment of union with the absolute by means of mystic abstraction, should be productive of means of attaining the desired end which were grossly immoral the Tantras of the later Hinduism, which in Bengal have ousted the Veda, which in a very real sense are the most important books of a large section of Hindus, and which are certainly by no means without occidental and American admirers, are in ultimate analysis descendants of one side of the mysticism of which a higher form appears in the Upanisads. The same tendencies were from the first marked in Buddhism, as in the earliest texts we find the possession of certain supernatural powers admitted as real.

doubt: 1 they are the products of the indigenous philosophy of India, most interesting expositions of early and acute efforts to grasp the nature of the universe and man's place in the cosmos, of vital importance for the under- standing of Indian philosophy and religious life in later times, since the con- ceptions which they enunciate have for the rest of Indian intellectual progress preponderant weight and influence. In comparison with the rest of Indian philosophy they excel in interest no less than in literary form and in freedom of thought: the deadly defect of the Buddhist dialogues, interminable repetition and dullness accentuated by the heaping up of synonyms or quasi- synonyms, is only nascent in the Upanisads, which again are happily exempt from the painful duty imposed on Śankara of expounding his idealism in the form of commentaries on texts which he must take as binding upon him and expressing one consistent doctrine, in face of the fact that obviously they do nothing of the sort. On the other hand, regarded as serious contributions to the solution of the fundamental problems of philosophy, the value of the Upanisads must be considered to be comparatively small: morcover they became known to the western world at a time when the development of philo- sophy had reached a point at which it could acquire little or nothing of great value from the Upanisads: to measure the exact effect of their influence on Schopenhauer would be extremely difficult, especially having regard to the fact that he knew them only in a version which often completely misrepre- sented their sense; but in the long run Schopenhauer himself represents merely a back current in the course of the stream of philosophy to its un- attainable goal.

A stronger claim,3 however, has been made for the value of the doctrine of the Upanisads as a school of mysticism, an attempt to gain personal experience of God found within the heart as a result of self-purification', or as a constant process of self-purification to the intent that God may be found within', definitions in which as applied to the Upanisads God must be under- stood as the Brahman. It is claimed from this point of view that the Upanisads have the superiority over Christian mysticism in originality, since that depends vitally on Plotinus, while it is admitted that the mysticism of the Upanisads is too purely metaphysical, and lacks the ethical and social content of Christian mysticism. Much of Christian mysticism, however, seems defective in this regard equally with the Upanisads, though it may be conceded that, unlike the Upanisads, the Christian mystics

The Philosophy of the Veda

professed a faith in which essential stress was laid on morality. Christian mysticism,1 however, is undoubtedly differentiated from that of the Upanisads by reason of the difference between the conception of God and that of the Brahman, even though in certain mystics the personal character of the divinity tends to be merged, while in the later Upanisads a personal deity appears in lieu of an impersonal absolute. In harmony with this distinction is the normally greater personal character of the mysticism of Christian seers, men and women alike. From this point of view the Upaniṣads may justly be accorded greater value and importance than from that of philosophy proper, and it is significant that it is in Christian mystics that we find utterances which the seers of the Upanisads would have found far easier to interpret than the Kantian system, such as that of St. Catherine, My being is God, not by simple participation, but by a true transformation of being', or Eckhardt's, "When the soul has lost itself and everything in God, it finds itself again in God when it attains to the knowledge of Him, and it finds also everything which it had abandoned in God', or his emphatic denial that God has any definite character of his own.2 

L 

It is this fact of universalism that gives the mysticism of the Upanisads in its purest form its chief appeal to many minds, which find in the cult of a personal deity too narrow an outlook and too selfish a destiny for man. To such spirits as these the ideal of merger in the absolute presents an effective antidote to the narrowness of traditional religion, and thus the philosophy of the Upanisads has for them the same attraction as systems of absolute idealism have had for many types of western mind. The chief distinction, however, between the standpoint of the Upanisads in this regard and that of western theories of the absolute is that the Upanisads do not feel any serious necessity for finding a place for morality and political life, while in the west from Hegel onwards heroic, if unsuccessful, efforts have been made by the followers of this ideal to establish morality and civil life as an essential clement in the absolute. The contrast admits of explanation on many grounds, but one of the most obvious is the fact that the system of caste provided ready-made an ethical framework which no philosopher cared to attack, while political organi- zation remained almost stationary.
