      <description>It is not altogether easy to derive from the Rigveda a precise conception of the nature which was attributed to the spirits of the dead by the mind of the people or of the priest, and it is natural to assume that the ground for this difficulty is to be traced to the variation of both popular and ecclesiastical opinion. The modern view of the spirits and their abode is extremely varied and confused, and it would be ill-judged to assume that it was otherwise in the earlier Vedic religion.</description>

[Part IV
The chief place of the dead in the conception of the Rigveda1 is unquestionably heaven: the soul leaves the body on death, and by the path of the Fathers it goes to the place where there is eternal light, endowed with lustre like that of the gods. It is said to go as by a car or by wings: more completely the Atharvaveda pictures the dead man as borne up by the Maruts, with gentle breezes fanning him, and cooled by showers until he recovers his complete body, and meets with the Fathers in the highest heaven, where with Yama they dwell.</description>

      <description>3
The Rigveda and the Vedic literature of the period of the Samhitas and the Brāhmaṇas presents us with no clear proof of the belief in the transmigration of the dead: the scanty evidence which has been adduced to prove the contrary view will be discussed hereafter, but in this place it is important to note certain really popular beliefs of which there are traces in that literature and in that of the Sutras.</description>
