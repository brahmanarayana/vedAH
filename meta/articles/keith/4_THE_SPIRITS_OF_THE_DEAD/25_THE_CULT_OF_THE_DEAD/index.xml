      <description>THE attitude of the Vedic Indian to his dead is one of distinctive and pronounced individuality. The constant anxiety lest from the dead should come injury to the living is perfectly obvious, but it must be admitted that it does not show any trace of being due to the direct fear of the spirit of the dead: it is the fear of death which marks the attitude of the Indian: the dead has not a hostile nature, but the thing which has affected him is to be feared.</description>

In this case the offering or &amp;lsquo;Śrāddha&amp;rsquo;, which bears its name of that which is connected with Śraddha, faith&amp;rsquo;, from the fact that the presents to the Brahmans which accompany the offerings to the dead reveal the faith of the offerer in the Brahmans, is to be performed on the waxing half of the month, and before midday the number of Brahmans chosen is even, not as usual odd: the performances are from left to right, not vice versa; barley replaces sesame; the milk meal lumps are mixed with sour milk and roasted grains, and the Fathers are addressed as Nandimukha, &amp;lsquo;joyful in countenance&amp;rsquo;, 5 in place of with tearful countenance&amp;rsquo;, which is elsewhere not rarely used.</description>
