The white Andhra University van was surrounded by excited towns folk pressing close to peer through its windows. Something nefarious

must be under way, particularly since a Foreign woman was inside with  three men. The sound of chanting was unsettling. After the recording  session was completed, the crowd was told that the dora from America,  his wife, and a professor from Andhra University were scholars seeking  to learn about the Vedas from the young pandit assigned to parayana in  the nearby temple here in Simhacalam, and that the van afforded the  only quiet place for recording. The recitant so generous with his time and  expertise on that December evening in 1980 was Kapilavayi (Kapilavai)  Venkatesvara Sastri. 

Most of the narratives thus far have disclosed the unfortunate termination  of lineages of ahitagnis and other Veda pandits. The recent family histories  of Baballa, Bulusu Cayanulu, Lanka, Bulusu Kamesvara, Laksminarayana,  and Mitranarayana all highlight an extraordinary and seemingly irreversible  attrition in Konasima at the close of the twentieth century. At that point only  the lineages of Duvvuri Yajulu and Samavedam, among all those families  selected here for review, gave promise of continuity in Veda. As for srauta,  one by one the agni-hotra fires went cold like the lamps of a village aban doned to sleep. Konasima darkened in the six-year period 1993 to 1999 with  successive losses of Baballa, Duvvuri Yajulu’s wife Surya, Laksminarayana’s  wife Kamesvari, Bulusu Cayanulu, and Lanka, leaving at the close of the cen 

tury only the hearths of Bulusu Kamesvara and Mitranarayana, both at that  time with fires in abeyance. With the loss of Bulusu Kamesvara in 2010, only  Mitranarayana remained. It is revealing therefore to turn to a final pair of  families extended out from Konasima to the west and to the north, both of  them illustrating strong lineages of Veda, and one suggesting eventual vital 

ity in srauta as well. 

The first of these two families to be considered is the Kapilavayis and  the second will be the Gullapallis in Iragavaram, West Godavari District.  Two active Kapilavayi Veda pandit brothers, ages sixty-one and fifty-seven in  2014, are employed in parayana positions in regionally famous Andhra pil 

grimage temples and both maintained strong aspirations toward ahitagni life upon retirement. Each projected hopeful and elaborate plans for increas ingly complex srauta sacrifices for years beyond adhana and agni-stoma, these  life-changing rituals to take place after completion of temple duties. These  two might be charged with boastful daydreams were it not for their remark able pedigree. They are Kapilavayi Venkatesvara Sastri and Kapilavayi Rama  Sastri, the two sons of Kapilavayi Yajnesvara Agnihotra Sastri of Kakinada, a  colleague of Renducintala Yajulu. Together, these two elder statesmen were  assiduous promoters of Veda and srauta throughout Andhra for all of their  twentieth-century careers.
