      <description>The white Andhra University van was surrounded by excited towns folk pressing close to peer through its windows. Something nefarious must be under way, particularly since a Foreign woman was inside with three men. The sound of chanting was unsettling. After the recording session was completed, the crowd was told that the dora from America, his wife, and a professor from Andhra University were scholars seeking to learn about the Vedas from the young pandit assigned to parayana in the nearby temple here in Simhacalam, and that the van afforded the only quiet place for recording.</description>

      <description>The brothers’ narrative begins with an astonishing family history that reads like the plot of a Salman Rushdie novel. A nineteenth-century ahitagni named Kapilavayi Venkata Somayajulu and his wife Subbalaksmi Somidevamma raised five sons and three daughters in Kakinada, the town where Mitranarayana is now the sole remaining ahitagni.
Their first son, Pedda Rama Sastri (1889–1987) lived for ninety-eight years. He was an extraordinarily dynamic Veda pandit but remained a lifelong bachelor and was therefore ineligible for a single consecrated fire let alone aspirations to tretagni.</description>

      <description>Both contemporary Kapilavayi brothers inherited their father’s passion for the life of srauta and benefited from a childhood spent not only learning Vedas but being on the move with their father, uncles, and others, observing sacrifices ordinary and extraordinary. From seven to twelve years of age Venkatesvara, born in 1953, learned the Taittiriya Samhita with Apastamba and from thirteen to fifteen he undertook the three khandas—adhvaryava, hotriya, and audgatriya—with the aid of a well-worn palm-leaf bundle about twenty inches thick, “the Srautam” in Sanskrit Telugu script of his grandfather.</description>

      <description>The second son of Yajnesvara Agnihotra grew up with the free-spirited demeanor of a self-confident younger brother. He is a completely open and guileless man. Although he frequently participates in rituals with his brother, four years older, the distance between Annavaram and Simhacalam assures him freedom to live his own quite similar life in another popular pilgrimage town, serving parayana as an Athar Veda pandit in the temple of Satyanarayana. Perhaps in a form of obeisance to Venkatesvara, whose business cards read “Catur-vedin,” Rama Sastri, with virtually identical training, although weighted somewhat more in the direction of the Atharva Veda, including its Brahmana, claims only “Tri-vedin,” master of three and not all four Vedas.</description>

      <description>Over several decades both contemporary Kapilavayi brothers have narrated with out hesitation the ritual rivalry in which their father was engaged. What is termed srauta-kaksa, rivalry in both performance and knowledge of srauta, is as old as the rituals.11 The expectation of a great many texts, the new or full-moon sacrifice every fortnight, for example, is that the sacrificer has enemies, one adversary in particular who is to be brought to mind.</description>
