title = "4 Rama Sastri and Family"

+++

The second son of Yajnesvara Agnihotra grew up with the free-spirited  demeanor of a self-confident younger brother. He is a completely open and  guileless man. Although he frequently participates in rituals with his brother,  four years older, the distance between Annavaram and Simhacalam assures  him freedom to live his own quite similar life in another popular pilgrimage  town, serving parayana as an Athar Veda pandit in the temple of Satyanarayana.  Perhaps in a form of obeisance to Venkatesvara, whose business cards read  “Catur-vedin,” Rama Sastri, with virtually identical training, although weighted  somewhat more in the direction of the Atharva Veda, including its Brahmana,  claims only “Tri-vedin,” master of three and not all four Vedas. 

Annavaram is north of Kakinada, still in East Godavari District but outside  of Konasima and somewhat less involved in the Vedic life of the agrahara surveyed earlier. The Satyanarayana temple perches brightly on the hilltop  Ratnagiri above a lake and the town of Annavaram, attracting the eye of pil grims on trains between Rajahmundry and Tuni. Tens of thousands of women  come for the Satyavati vrata, a vow to the famous goddess of the temple who  stands on one side of Satyanarayana while a linga occupies the niche on the  other side of this Vaisnava god. By 1998 the temple had acquired eleven pan dits reciting daily, one for the Rg Veda, six for Taittiriya, and two each for the  Atharva and Sama Vedas. Three of them are ghana-pathi. 

With such a vigorous representation of daily Vedic recitals it is not surpris ing that this Vaisnava temple frequently softens the borders of “Hinduism.”  In March 1998 a “ “yajna” inside the compound featured ten offering altars,  two sets of five separated by a great cloth screen into two sala with wicker  mat roofs, scores of pandits working at each, all hosted by Rama Sastri as  adhvaryu. Venkatesvara and many other famous Andhra pandits were among  those offering ghee onto the burning slabs of wood. During a break in the day long sacrifice the brothers described the event, their speech a seamless flow of  mantras, as if a single voice, reminding the listener that they share the same  paternal guru. 

The newer government-assisted Veda pandit economy has been as reward ing for Rama Sastri as it has for his brother. His house on Kapilavayi Street is  an impressive reinforced concrete structure of five stories, all but completed  by 2005 when two daughters, long since married, were still living at home  along with Agnihotra Sarma, the only son. The fifth floor is a splendid library  of more than 150 tala-patra stored in steel trunks to ward off insects, with many  other younger books and manuscripts on neat shelves. By 2014 the house was  as electronically up-to-date as any American household.

Rama Sastri had his upanayana in Kasi at age eleven when the whole fam ily was in peregrination mode, his father again serving as guru to a son. As  Venkatesvara was directed to the Rg Veda after completion of the Taittiriya  corpus, rather than going on to the ghana recitation pattern, so was Rama  Sastri steered by his father into a second Veda, this time the Atharva Veda, as  if to program his future appointment. 

Like his older brother, Rama Sastri has an open, generous, and unre strained personality, perhaps somewhat more relaxed than Venkatesvara who  has taken on the more imposing demeanor of his father and uncle. Rama  Sastri happily unrolled a canvas bedroll containing his collection of ritual  implements, aranis, juhu, upabhrt, camasa, and other cherished items and  handed them out for inspection. On more than one occasion he interrupted  discussion to offer rice for lunch, the only pandit to open this sacred gate to  commensality, solo coffee or tea being the normal limit for a non-Brahman  guest. And twice he offered overnight stays. 

His wife, Bonapalli Maruti, a truly remarkable woman, is equally outgo ing, bold, eager to display her wide knowledge of Veda and srauta, adroitly  and without affectation inserting a relevant point into a circle of male discus sants. Daughter of a Veda pandit with wide srauta knowledge, granddaugh ter of an ahitagni, she grew up in an agrahara in Repalle, Guntur District,  not far from the agrahara birthplace of Venkatesvara’s wife but closer to the  mouth of the Krishna River. Both Kapilavayi brothers were students of her  grandfather, living in the house six months of the year, and it was Rama  Sastri to whom she was given in marriage. When she joined her husband  to live in Kasi at age sixteen she had already witnessed and understood  many major srauta rituals. For the first seven years of residence with her  Kapilavayi family she ate prasada from various sacrifices, yajna payasam, rice  pudding thought to aid in conception of a son. Of all the patnis over years of  interviews it was the energetic, ever youthful Maruti who provided the most  nuanced observations of Vedic life, frequently clarifying important points  that had been overlooked.10 

On one afternoon in 2005 she rocked a three-month-old grandson, first  side to side in a wooden cradle, then head to toe in a green hammock sus pended from the ceiling of the spacious and immaculate new house. The baby  had just started making fists as a new motor skill and therefore was visited  by relatives who brought fist-sized balls of rice flour in his honor. As Maruti  performed the age-old rocking task she elaborated on the stringent Sutra rules  for the patni in safe-guarding the household fires.

Rama Sastri is dedicated to an extreme. He agreed to be udgatr for a paun darika in Tirupati in 2005. He had seen paundarika in his childhood and youth  but had not observed one for twenty years and was anxious about his compe tence. He commented: 

My long-deceased father appeared in a dream and assured me that  I would be all right. In my dream I was arranging the charts [he brings  them out as he narrates] and suddenly a breeze came and scattered  them, pages all flying about. I shouted “Please find them!” and a voice  said “Let them go, don’t worry!” I asked my father “How can you say

that? Tomorrow I have to perform paundarika!” He replied: “Don’t be  afraid. I am with you.” When I woke up I was chilled by this. 

Similarities between the careers of the brothers are evident. As with  Venkatesvara, all three daughters were married on schedule. Sita Nagalaksmi,  having achieved a bachelor of commerce degree in computer sciences and  employment as an English teacher, married a Veda pandit in Bapatla village,  Guntur District. She is an exceptionally beautiful young woman with a mel 

lifluous voice for singing devotional hymns. Agnivati Nagalaksmi, three years  younger, married a Veda pandit from Draksarama and now lives in Vijayawada.  Svaha Devi, youngest daughter and the only one to remain in East Godavari  District, was married at age eleven in 1998 to a Smarta Brahman, a former stu 

dent of her father from Elesvaram. The momentous news in 2005 was the deci sion announced by Sita Nagalaksmi that she and her husband, Pavan Kumar  Sarma, a Veda pandit in the Bhavanarayana temple in Bapatla, Guntur District,  were ready to set the fires for adhana. A decade later they are still waiting for  

Rama Sastri himself to set fires, now planned for his retirement date in 2016. Agnihotra Sarma, after his upanayana in May 1998, did agni-karya at home  (see Figure 2.3, Kapilavayi Agnihotra Sarma doing agni-karya with a fire pot,  Annavaram, 2005). Also in the image of his father, he began to assume rtvij roles at a young age. At fourteen, while in ninth class in school and moving  up to padam in the Taittiriya corpus he served as prastatr in the Tirupati paun darika in which his father was udgatr and his uncle Venkatesvara was hotr.  Earlier he had been subrahmanya for an agni-stoma with his acquisition of rit ual roles well under way. By 2014 he achieved two titles, Sama Veda teacher in  the Bapatla Sankara Vidyalayam and Yajur Veda pandit doing parayana there.  The hopeful srauta lineage continues with his son, Rama Sastri and Maruti’s  grandson, Maruti Rama Yajnesvara.
