The brothers’ narrative begins with an astonishing family history that reads  like the plot of a Salman Rushdie novel. A nineteenth-century ahitagni named  Kapilavayi Venkata Somayajulu and his wife Subbalaksmi Somidevamma  raised five sons and three daughters in Kakinada, the town where Mitranarayana  is now the sole remaining ahitagni. Their first son, Pedda Rama Sastri (1889– 

1987) lived for ninety-eight years. He was an extraordinarily dynamic Veda pan dit but remained a lifelong bachelor and was therefore ineligible for a single  consecrated fire let alone aspirations to tretagni. A second son born to Venkata  and Subbalaksmi was also a renowned Veda pandit, did marry and maintain  the grhya (smarta agni), but never set three fires as his father had done. He was  Chinna Rama Sastri (1904–85), a contemporary of Baballa. Chinna (Little or  Younger) Rama followed Pedda (Big or Elder) Rama in birth order. A third son  

was born and then twenty-one years after Pedda a fourth son arrived. Named Yajnesvara, this youngest was taught Veda by his oldest brother  Pedda, whose age made him equivalent to biological as well as spiritual  father. He too excelled and went on to become Yajnesvara Agnihotra Sastri  (1910–83), Kasyapa gotra, famous throughout South India for his sponsor ship of Veda and srauta. Sponsorship, supervision, promotion, boosterism  are all the right words. Although fully qualified through precocious acquisi tion of Veda in the best of places in India he, like his older brother Chinna  Rama Sastri, he did not accomplish adhana and therefore not agni-stoma, not  from lack of desire but rather from sibling blockade. He could not set fires  because his two older brothers had not done so. As compensation he became  an expert srotriya and the most impressive promoter of srauta in the modern  history of India. 

It is a narrative of filial devotion and stubborn guru loyalty combined,  one that makes sense only to those vedam-lo, in Veda. A younger brother may  not set fires if his older brother has not already done so. There are, however,  Dharmasastra provisions for parista, supercession, in which the older broth 

er’s permission may be sought. Why was this not a manageable solution, par ticularly in the unusual situation of a brother who chose, for personal reasons,  never to marry and become a householder qualified for Agni? The answer was  that Yajnesvara found it inconceivable to “one-up” his elders, in particular,  Pedda, his own guru. Becoming an agni-stomin, a soma sacrificer, confers priv ileged rank. He would have surpassed both older brothers, becoming karmad hikara, the official person in rituals for the family. Even sitting in the same row  to eat would be unacceptable. Furthermore, there was always the danger, in  ritual theory at least, that the second brother, Chinna, might change his mind  and perform agni-stoma after all, even in advanced age, thereby negating the

fruits of the younger brother’s sacrifice. And so, in this “always a bridesmaid,  never a bride” situation, never having been yajamana in a yajna he, Yajnesvara,  literally “Lord of Sacrifice,” became promoter of yajna par excellence, eventu ally to the point of being lauded with the title “Agni-hotra,” the name of that  elusive rite whose srauta version he would never perform. 

Yajnesvara’s upanayana was at the early age of six when he began to  learn the Taittiriya corpus from his brother Pedda. According to the family  he was something of a Wunderkind. On January 25, 1984, two months after  Yajnesvara’s death, M. Chandrasekhar published a hagiographical piece for  The Indian Express accompanied by a photo of Yajnesvara displaying a certifi 

cate in front of his chest like a sculpted Roman senator with tablet. The article  included these lines (orthography retained): 

The elders in the family and neighbours were wonderstruck to find  Yagneswara Sastry at 12 mellowing into a scholar with Vedavedangas,  Vidhyaranya Bhashya, Shatsastras, and sroutas on his fingertips. . . .  At 16 he conducted [i.e., supervised] the first yagna independently. . . .  [H]e went to the guru-kula asram of Kanchi Pitham at Kumbakonam  and dug out three tala-patras [palm leaf manuscripts] which the native  pandits failed to comprehend. He laboriously worked on the scriptures  till he unraveled the hidden meanings. 

However overblown this praise, Yajnesvara became the epitome of an  itinerant seeker of Vedic knowledge. He was on a lifetime quest for teachers  and texts. Sometimes in the company of brothers Pedda or Chinna or both,  sometimes followed by his wife and children, he took trains and buses from  point to point. Or much of the time he and his companions walked long dis 

tances, sadhu-like, carrying peanuts and cashew nuts for sustenance, in search  of Veda pandits who might be harboring little or unknown textual recensions  or ritual paddhati. At times he joined the entourage of one or another pithad hipati. Often he collaborated with his good friend Renducintala Yajulu, the  other great widely traveled Veda pandit with constant connections to the  Godavari Delta. It was a remarkable age. Today, mendicants of all stripes still  walk the roads but Veda pandits celebrate their recent affluence by riding in  trains, buses, or even taxis. 

Yajnesvara’s personal acquisition of Vedas extended beyond his mid dle years. At the age of fifty, for example, he learned the Sukla Yajurveda  (Vajasaneyi Samhita) in Kasi, up before dawn for adhyaya, retiring for rest  only at 8 pm. His special text was the Apastamba Srauta Sutra, simply labeled  “Srautam,” and his favored ritual was the paundarika, a type of agni-cayana he studied in a dozen forms and endorsed all over Andhra. Yajnesvara was

a supervisor of sacrifices over the territory of the great rivers, the Godavari,  Krishna, Kaveri, and well beyond, Ramesvaram, Sringeri, Kanci, Trichi in the  South to Bhadrinath, Delhi, and Kasi in the North. 

The Taittiriya corpus was of course the Urtext, but the Sama Veda became  a special preoccupation for Yajnesvara. Early in his career he had studied the  Ranayaniya recension in Vijayanagaram, and then the Kauthuma recension in  Kanci. The Jaiminiya recension apparently was unknown to him or too remote  to be of personal interest. As noted in Chapter 2, contemporary scholarship  on the Sama Veda is divided, some scholars seeing little or no difference  between Ranayaniya and Kauthuma, others suggesting some distinctions.9 

Nevertheless, according to his sons, Yajnesvara was able to identify the Sama  gana in use in the Godavari Delta as a variant distinct from any Ranayaniya or  Kauthama version known elsewhere. The difference was sufficient enough to  cause a serious rift between srauta families in the late twentieth century. 

As for the Atharva Veda, there has been more than one line of transmission  in the delta. Tangirala Balagangadhara Sastri, Lanka’s source, has been men tioned earlier. He also taught Yajnesvara in Kapilesvarapuram, and Yajnesvara  responded by teaching the Rg Veda, a case of Veda pandit reciprocity in Vedas  outside the Taittiriya corpus. Tangirala had learned the Atharva Veda in Kasi in  a special manner, mornings only, with an Agni vow (vrata), bearing an earthen  pot with burning coals on his head, a wet cloth cushioning the pot. And “stu dent” Yajnesvara did the same. 

Yajnesvara and Sita Mahalaksmi built a house in Vijayawada in Krishna  Lanka in 1975, relocating in Andhra after many years of peregrinations.  Like Lanka in his late years he continued to serve as supervisor for rituals, a  Vajapeya in Nedunuru, for example, in which Lanka and Yajnesvara together  were in charge.
