Veda Pandits 

In the next chapter, ten families are portrayed in capsule biographies of ahi tagni or other exemplary Veda pandits. Most of these families are now or were  for their productive years located in agrahara or agrahara-like villages in or  near Konasima. All families have multigenerational connections to Konasima  through marriage and other ritual activities, although one is established across  the Vasistha-Godavari in West Godavari District and another is split between  two pilgrimage temple towns. Pillars of these ten families include seven ahi 

tagni and a smaller number of eligible and aspirant ahitagni. All of those dis cussed here are well known to Veda pandit society of coastal Andhra and some  have the distinction of all-India honors in recognition of their achievements. 

By the late 1980s the golden age of srauta activity in Konasima had passed.  In continuing interviews for this book, a crucial research decision was made  to remain in Konasima rather than jump to Krishna District more than a hun dred miles by road to the west where the Dendukuris, Visnubhatlas, and other  families appeared to maintain active srauta lives. Guntur and Nellore Districts  were other possibilities. This resolution was based on several events. One was  an initial attempt in November 1980 to observe a srauta ritual in Vijayawada,  the major city in Krishna District. The sacrifice was mentioned in Konasima  by Lanka Venkatarama Sastri who had a rtvij role ongoing for a number of  days. After traveling there alone by train, walking to the suburban site, finding  that Lanka was not there at the time, and then being asked by the sacrificer  to leave, there was nothing to do but conduct an embarrassed retreat. The

full and somewhat bizarre story did not emerge until some time later. Three  years earlier the young American scholar Harold Arnold (the only one ever  known to visit coastal Andhra) went to nearby Jujjuru to witness a soma sacri fice. While he sat observing the paundarika, the bamboo and straw mat sadas caught fire; he was labeled the cause of damage to the ritual and told to leave.  Many years later the ahitagni Lanka mentioned this catastrophe caused by a  dora and said mischievously “Was that you?”20 

A second reason for remaining with the known pandits of Konasima  resulted from a more fruitful but disconcerting revisit to Vijayawada, this time  into the graciously accepting home of the Dendukuri ahitagni family. They  were forthcoming with some details about their teaching and ritual lives, but  mostly the occasion degenerated into a sales pitch and an opportunity to press  for money that quickly became distasteful. Perhaps the negative reaction was  due to long experience with Baballa, Lanka, Duvvuri Yajulu, Mitranarayana,  and other Konasima ahitagni shunning of veda-vikriya, the selling of Veda, the  undermining effect of associating religion and economic gain. And of course  an additional reason for adherence to Konasima was a deepening affection for  the Veda pandit families there and a conviction that their many robust voices  deserved wider recognition. This is the subject of the next chapter.
