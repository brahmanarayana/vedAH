Chapter 1

1. “The Dry Salvages.”

2. The crocodile is an enduring symbol. Asko Parpola makes the case for the  crocodile cult of the Indus civilization still existing among Gujarati tribals four  thousand years later (2012c, 2012b: 9).

3. Kashikar and Parpola (in Staal 1983.2: 204–5) provide evidence, chiefly from  Epigraphica indica, of other Vedic rituals documented from inscriptions discov ered in Andhra.

4. Thapar 1966–67 1: 173 with reference to Pallavas, Calukyas, and Rastrakutas;  Kulke and Rothermund 2010: 74.

5. Talbot 2001: 22. There is considerable elasticity in historical references to  “Vengi,” variously indicating the village-becoming-a-town near Eluru midway  between the Krishna and Godavari deltas, or the capital of the Eastern Calukas  that formerly was situated at Pithapuram, or the entire coastal zone between  the great deltas; cf. Mangalam 1980: 106–7 with maps and Gopalachari 1976.  A series of chieftains bearing the name Sankayana, possibly related to a Vedic  lineage, ruled from Vengi for about a hundred years until they were displaced  by Visnukundins early in the fifth century.

6. Satyanarayana 1975–83: 2, 25.

7. Rath 2012: 189 and plate XV.

8. Nilakanta Sastri 1976: 4, 453–56.

9. Jawaharlal 1994:  45–53; Jaini 1979:  281. Jawaharlal notes that Jaina antiqui ties have been excavated in twenty-two villages in the two Godavari Districts  (105–6).

10. Dundas 1992: 102.

11. Narayana Rao and Shulman 2002: 81.

278 Notes

12. Narayana Rao 1990: 7.

13. Cf. Nilakanti Sastri 1976: 166.

14. The lingering effects of endemic filarial worms, smallpox, and malaria, all  thought to be goddess-produced, gave an uncanny atmosphere to the town in  1980: scores of temple priests and other residents dragged grotesque elephan tiasis feet about the lanes.

15. Richard Eaton (2005) tracks the career of this exceptional sovereign as the first  of eight lives he artfully employs to portray the vicissitudes of Deccan culture  and politics from the fourteenth through the eighteenth centuries. And Cynthia  Talbot (2000) explores a text composed c. 1490–1550 she regards as the first  Telugu historiography, the Pratiparudra Caritamu, the Story of Pratipa Rudra,  with a version of Kakatiya dynastic events that varies considerably from that of  Indo-Muslim historians.

16. Satyanarayana 1975–83: 2, 94–5. A thorough and convincing study by Richard  Eaton (2000) of temple desecration during the Indo-Muslim period of 1192– 1728 does not mention in his list of eighty destroyed temples the replace ment of the Rajahmundry temple of Venugopal by a mosque under the reign  of Muhammad Tughluq. Sounding a note of caution regarding the view in  Indo-Muslim accounts (as well as later Hindu nationalist perspectives) of con stant Muslim destruction of temples, he builds a case for Indo-Muslim support  and protection of Hindu temples once a region had been subjugated. His argu ment is that temples were political institutions with shared sovereignty of a  king and the deity within a royal temple. Since resident deities were closely con nected to ruling authorities, Hindu as well as Muslim warring kings removed  temple images in order to defuse or co-opt their powers.

20. Richards 1995: 214.

21. Pathak 1960: 126–27.

22. Merchants from Sweden and the Austrian Ostend Company also played minor  roles in trade.

23. Burton Stein reports its population to be 100,000 at the end of the sixteenth  century (1989: 127).

24. Prakash 1998: 208–9; cf. 260–1. Not as successful as the Dutch and English on  the Coromandal coast, the Danish Company was dissolved in 1650. Two succes sor companies were formed but by 1807 Danish presence had ended. 25. Prakash 1998: 164.

30. See Figure  1.1, this chapter, Mukkamalla Lock sluice gate on the canal sys tem designed by Cotton. Sources for Cotton’s projects in the deltas include  Cotton 1854 and 1968. Cotton’s was of course not the first attempt to tame the  Godavari, levees and tanks having been constructed as early as the Pallava and  Calukya periods; cf. Stein 1989: 21, 24;Schmitthenner 2011.

31. P. R. Rao 1980: 76.

32. When the American researcher first heard this common expression he was  shocked: Huns were the dreaded Germans of his childhood, barbarians whose  lust for empire started both World Wars. In India, however, the Huns are not  limited to invaders of the Punjab in the fifth century ce but also include British  aggressors who established a universal system of education that—in the eyes  of traditional Veda pandits—was incompatible with Vedic learning.

33. Jones 1989: 161–62.

34. On Kandukuri Virasalingam, see his autobiography translated from Telugu  by V. Ramakrishna Rao and T. Rama Rao (Rajahmundry: Adepally, n.d.); the  biography by John G.  Leonard 1979; A.  A. Rao, 2010:  49–51, 96–98; Forbes  1996: 23–25; P. R. Rao 1980: 76–80.

35. On Radhakrishnan, see Gopal 1989; Minor 1987; A. A. Rao, 2010: 141–44. 36. On Sitaramayya, see P. R. Rao 1980: 221–22. In his useful and well-illustrated  history of Kakinada Allam Appa, Rao includes an overview of thirty-two other  Godavari political leaders (2010: 147–69).

37. P.  R. Rao 1980:  142–47; on the history of the Nizams of Hyderabad, see  Ramusack 2004: Index.

38. Alphabetical List of Villages in the Taluks and Districts of the Madras Presidency (Madras: Government Press, 1914), 129–41, lists 120 in Amalapuram Taluk but  omits many well-known villages including Munganda.

39. As will be noted in Chapter 3, several Veda pandits rented out portions or all  of their crop fields as “gentleman farmers,” with actual farmers honoring oral  agreements and paying in produce. Writing of earlier centuries, David Ludden  credits coastal Andhra village elders who supervised rental transactions in oral  contracts linked to market prices (1999: 178).

40. Talbot 2001: 98, 116.

41. On Gangamma in Tirupati, see Flueckiger 2013.

42. Thousands of devotees trekked barefooted to a tiny village in a northern tract  of East Godavari District to see and hear a pre-pubescent goddess before she  suddenly died, some say as victim of cetabadi (sorcery) from a jealous woman  possession ritualist (Knipe 2005: 100–104 and 2004a).

43. In addition to citations listed earlier, other sources for the political, social, and  cultural history of the region include Asher and Talbot 2006; Irschick 1994.

280 Notes

Chapter 2

1. Srauta, based on sruti, “that which is heard,” i.e., the Veda, is not easily distin guished as a ritual category. Jan Gonda and other scholars have defined srauta rituals as “solemn” or “public” but neither term is satisfactory. More accurate  in both time and space, “extended” describes this complex schedule of rites  advanced beyond the grhya domestic program.

2. These portions are known in Telugu as panna and in Sanskrit as prasna, liter ally “questions” or “lessons.” Chapter 4 expands further on the student’s Vedic  textual absorption.

3. This is not to suggest that Vedic Brahmans alone are capable of prodigious  feats of memory. Before immigrating to Wisconsin from Scotland at the age  of eleven, John Muir, the naturalist of Rocky Mountain fame, had memorized  the entire New Testament and nearly half the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament),  having been beaten into compliance by his father. Numerous Muslims memo

rize the entire Qur’an, Jaina monks often have phenomenal memories, and  adherents of other faiths as well as secular folk such as numerologists are fur ther examples. In 2013, a student from an Indian immigrant family was the  American national champion speller, a thirteen-year-old Telugu speaker in sev enth grade, Arvind Mahankali, who placed third in the contest in 2010 and 2011  (New York Times June 1, 2013, p. A1).

4. The upanayana is detailed in Chapter 4.

5. The ritual of marriage, vivaha, is described in Chapter 5 covering the lives of  householders.

6. Kane rejects Ram Gopal’s arguments for a North Indian home for Apastamba  and suggests the school may have originated in “Andhra and the territory about  the mouth of the Godavari” (Kane 1968–75, 1.1:67; cf. Gopal 1983a: 94–98).  Textual scholars date the ApSS to c. 500 bce, the ApGS to perhaps two centuries  later, and a third Apastamba Sutra, the Dharma Sutra, to c. 300 bce. To be kept  in mind is the vast span of centuries between assembly of the hymns of the RV  in the period c. 1750–1500 bce and the application of mantras and chants in the  Brahmana-texts and Sutras.

7. This offering is sthali-pakana, the cooking of rice in a pot (sthali) as an isti per formed every new-and-full moon day. Tachikawa and Kolhatkar 2006 provide  an excellent portrayal of every step of the sthali-paka with 110 photos of per formances by Ganeshashastri Shende (1899–1992) in Maharashtra according  to AsvGS. There is also a brief introduction and text and translation of a ritual  manual including mantras from the RV and injunctions from the TB and both  Asvalayana Sutras.

8. On the Sama Veda, D.  Arkasomayaji, at the TTD office in Tirupati noted  November 13, 1980: “I have heard Sama Veda recitations in Konasima and they  are unlike the other three, Jaiminiya, Kauthuma, and Ranayaniya. Konasima

Notes 281

has preserved one of the many other ancient sakha.” On the other hand, Western  scholars, including Parpola and Heesterman, perceive only two recensions,  Jaiminiya and Kauthuma-Ranayaniya, the latter pair approximately identical.  Howard (1977) observes distinctions between Kauthuma and Ranayaniya and  notes that the “Kauthuma” of Tamil Nadu is actually Ranayaniya. Cf. Renou  1947: 85–129. It is not surprising that disagreements persist since there are  thousands of ganas and musical notations are variable. Further field recording  and study is clearly warranted.

9. Staal 1983: 1: 45f; 2: 201–55.

10. This triadic classification is not in the Vedas although, as Frederick Smith  (1987: 122–224) explains it, TS 2:1–4 essentially makes such a separation. 11. The patni (wife) does not drink soma in the ritual but obtains it by eating the  leftovers of her husband’s food. After her death and cremation a “re-burning”  or secondary cremation is required to remove traces of soma from her bones.  Chapter 6 provides further details on this important circumstance. 12. Staal 1983; the 40-minute film Altar of Fire was produced by Frits Staal and directed  by Robert Gardner, Berkeley: University of California Media Center, 1977. 13. The daksina that should go to each priest as a share of the sacrifice, are notori ously open-ended, often extravagant. Dividing up a thousand cows is a recurrent  notation. ApSS 13.5.1–13 is an example of variability, including the sacrificer’s  entire estate with an exception of an inheritance share for the first son. On one  hand is a demonstrative potlatch enterprise. On the other hand is the intrigu ing directive to the sacrificer (13.6.6) to divide body and soul as daksina, his  mind to the brahman, breath to the adhvaryu, eye to the udgatr, even his atman to the sadasya, seventeenth priest, a remarkable presentation to this minor but  symbolically significant actor, the number seventeen being that of Prajapati,  lord of sacrifice.

14. This “plus one” formula is discussed in Knipe 1975:1–18 and 1991:40–42.  Abstract numbers occur in many contexts as, for example, the “totality” of six teen surmounted by Prajapati as seventeen, discussed by Gonda 1984 index. Cf.  also Proferes 2007: 23–76, “Ritual fires and the construction of sovereignty.” 15. Fuller 1992: 57.

16. Among elements evoking intense human responses, fire has a special place in  the history of religions. See Knipe 2004b and 1975: 45–89; Bachelard 1964a;  Heesterman, 1983, 1993: 86–141; Falk 2002; Patton 2005: 104–111.

17. On the Zoroastrian cult of fire in ancient Iran, see Boyce 1986, 1975, 1979.  On soma see Jan Houben 2003 with a substantial bibliography; Parpola 1995,  2012a: 247–51; the botanist Harri Nyberg 1995; Falk 1989; Staal 1983 1: 105– 13; McClymond 2008: 101–11. On expansion of the BMAC (Bactria Margiana  Archaeological Complex) see Chapter 1 this volume and Parpola 2002a, 2012a;  on the post-Vedic history of the soma plant see the essay by Wendy Doniger

282 Notes

O’Flaherty in Wasson 1968: 95–147; on the background of the soma-theft myth,  Knipe 1967.

18. An obsession with the dangerous impurity (asauca, asuddha) and inauspicious ness of menstrual blood seems strange to the contemporary West until one  looks into some bizarre attitudes and concepts of nineteenth-century Europe  and America. For the affluent, paper-rich West, “feminine napkins” have been  available to women for over a century, the even more discreet mini-tampons  being a more recent innovation. No banishment from kitchen or dining areas  and, with electric washing machines a standard household item, no embar rassing garment stains in the laundry. But for occasional guarded TV ads, the  monthly change for perhaps a third of the population goes without remark by  male Western culture. India, with an entire “unclean” caste of men and women  laboring in rivers and streams to wash clothes, takes a closer look at this female  “disease” as if it were dangerously infectious and, ritually speaking, it is tradi tionally considered to be exactly that.

19. This bodily assumption of sacred fires is described at the close of TS 3.4.10  with reference to the sacrificer as the birthplace of Agni and therefore a proper  temporary container outside of the hearths. The term atma-rohana is not  accepted by some Konasima authorities although ApSS.6.28.10-11 describes  the procedure of bodily assumption immediately after transfer into arani. On  the wood for arani, asvattha grown on a sami tree, see ApSS 5.1.2. Frederick  Smith 1987: 92–96 details the techniques of both churning and consignment  of fire; cf. Heesterman 1993: 94ff.

20. Frederick Smith 1987: 49 and n.168 describes the 1977 paundarika sacrifice.  A  similar event occurred in coastal Andhra during a neighborhood festival  when the featured goddess’s ritual pole suddenly fell to the ground. In the  ensuing pandemonium a German scholar-observer seen running for cover was  blamed for carrying off the goddess in his beard.

Chapter 3

1. Further details on wives, marriage, children, and the householder’s life are dis cussed in Chapter 5.

2. More details on antyesti, the offering of the body, sraddha, ancestor rituals, and  afterlife are discussed in Chapter 6.

3. The musi-vayanam is detailed in Chapter 5. For an extensive discussion of this  special coastal Andhra funeral with a female Brahman ritualist, see Knipe 2003. 4. Avadhani or Avadhanulu is an honorific (from Sanskrit avadhana, “attention,  attentiveness”) signaling special ability to remember important matters, in this  case, Veda. It is commonly affixed to Veda pandit names of those who have  achieved the status of krama-pathi.

Notes 283

5. Manu 5.167–68 allows for remarriage and rekindling of fire; cf. Kane 1968–75,  4: 225.

6. A  correction to the 1997 essay, “Becoming a Veda in the Godavari Delta” is  acknowledged here: whereas both of his sons became ghana-pathi Samavedam  senior did not achieve that rank.

7. Cf. Stephanie Jamison’s remarks on hospitality 1996:182–84. 8. The quiet, virtually anonymous presence in Kakinada, the bustling headquar ters of East Godavari District, of an ahitagni well known among Vedic Brahmans  across South India was revealed by M.  V. Krishnayya to the vice chancellor  of Jawaharlal Nehru Technical University in Kakinada, Professor Alam Appa  Rao. The vice chancellor published his sumptuously illustrated book Kakinada. The Making of a University City (Hyderabad: Geographica 2010) with biographi cal details on the educational, political, and cultural lights of the area with no  mention of Mitranarayana or his famous predecessor, now deceased, Uppuluri  Ganapati Sastri. Amends were made late in 2010 with a videotaped celebratory  meeting and portrait photography of Mitranarayana and his wife Anasuya. 9. See Chapter 2, n. 8.

10. Only Bulusu Kamesvara’s wife Satyavati was comparable. It is most probable  that Venkatesvara’ late wife, Sita Rama Laksmi, was equally well informed; less  research time, however, was spent in Simhacalam than in Annavaram. Other  patni might have contributed had they been allowed to speak freely, particu

larly in the early 1980s when their srauta lives were still fresh in mind. Laksmi  Narasamamba was able to interview Anasuya, Lanka’s wife, privately in the  house, in 1991. Otherwise, on the rare occasion when she was present, Lanka  would always answer questions directed to her. Widows (Sundari, Anasuya,  Subbalaksmi, others) were always open and forthcoming.

11. See Knipe 2004a on “ritual subversion.”

12. Being familiar with Indian books and the many creatures who dine on them,  these elders would appreciate a comment by Frits Staal: “Books bound in India  continue to fall apart but the Vedic Oral Tradition is still there” (2008: 252).

Chapter 4

1. On the Vedic textual tradition in general see Gonda 1975; Witzel 1987, 1997b;  Parpola 1997, 2002b: 44–48; Patton 1994a, 1994b, 2004a; Holdrege 1994a,  1994b.

2. Bachelard 1964a, 1964b, 1969. This is also in illo tempore, “in that time,”  the “great” time (Eliade 1959:  80–113) when cosmically foundational events  occurred, an age newly recovered and entered by living believers. By intu iting Veda the great rsis established both sacred text and ritual; those today  who “enter” Veda live in that time writ large and even speak of themselves as

284 Notes

legatees of rsis whose names they recite twice daily and are believed to watch  over them.

3. Staal 1989: 48.

4. On the upanayana and career of the brahmacarin, see Kane 1968–74, 2.1: 268– 415; Brian Smith 1989: 92–101; Pandey 1969:111–40.

5. Pandits insist on Vedic oral transmission ab origine. It has been put forth  that limited early writing of a Veda may have occurred, for example, in the  pada-patha legacy; see Bronkhorst 1982; contra Falk 1993. On “orality and  memory culture” and an aversion to written transmission of sacred texts see  the important essay by Houben and Rath 2012.

6. On dating Vedic texts see n.1 above; Olivelle 1996: xxxvi–xxxvii on the Upanisads;  Gonda 1977 and Lingat 1973: 20–23 on Apastamba’s Sutras.

7. Bachelard 1969: 20.

8. Ricoeur 1995: 164; cf. 162–66.

9. On sama-vartana see further Heesterman 1968; Kane 1968–75, 2.1: 405–15;  Pandey 1969: 146–52.

10. This Andhra specialty has afforded more than one pandit mentioned in this  survey with nearly a fulltime career.

11. On sakha see Gonda 1975; Witzel 1987, 1997b; Renou 1947; Patton 2005: 31–36. 12. Of 401 names in one catalogue of Veda pandits in Andhra (Jeeyar 1976) only  nine are listed as Rg Vedins with Asvalayana Sutra.

13. Jeeyar 1976 has only a single pandit listed for Andhra: “Kauthuma sakha, Sama  Veda, Drahyayana Sutra.” Three are given as “Ranayaniya sakha, Sama Veda,”  but with Asvalayana Sutra; possibly they acquired the Sama Veda after the Rg  Veda.

14. Jeeyar 1976 lists ten Sukla Yajur Veda pandits for Andhra, all with Katyayana  as Sutra, three of them in Madhyandina sakha, seven in Kanva sakha. Of the  Kanvas three are in Kothapeta, East Godavari District.

15. A different tale accounting for this epithet came from another Taittiriya pandit:  “Madhyandina students once challenged their guru and in anger he recipro cated ‘You Candalas!’ The curse of a guru cannot be reversed, only ameliorated.  They pleaded for mercy and the guru relented. So exactly at noon for half an  hour they are Untouchable Candalas. So they are excluded, have no right to eat  with others due to caste pollution. We may not even talk to them! They have to  keep to themselves!”

16. On the Vidhana texts for various samhita and the use of vidhi see Patton 2005:  27–34.

17. Still in use today in the Delta is another term for an assembly of learned  Brahmans, parisad, one found in the earliest Upanisads. Cf. Olivelle 1993: 210  where he cites ApDhS 1.3.11.38.

Notes 285

Chapter 5

1. The Cloudsplitter (New York: HarperCollins 1998), 37.

2. Sanskrit masa, moon, month; masika, monthly; cf. English menses, from Latin  mensis, month, Greek men, month, mene, moon.

3. That is to say, she disappears to the rear of the house. Velcheru Narayana Rao  (1994: 128) precisely describes the Andhra Brahman house with its division  into three areas, men in the front, women in back including the kitchen and  the backyard with a well where women gather and servants enter. In between  is a neutral zone where genders meet, the men entering discreetly by cough

ing or summoning a female to signal intended arrival. Cf. Marjatta Parpola  (2000: 142–43) on Naputiri “ownership of territory and privacy.” Regarding the period of impurity and seclusion, Holly Reynolds (1978: 100– 113) reports on Madurai District, Tamil Nadu (including certain influence from  Telugu Brahmans) that it is three to seven days, the first three being maximum  pollution; also on Tami Nadu, Gabriella Eichinger Fero-Luzzi (1974); on the  Namputiris in Kerala, M. Parpola (2000: 181). On an eighteenth-century ritual  manual, Julia Leslie (1989: 283–87). Frederique Apffel-Marglin (1985: 56f, 72f,  234f) gives details from Puri, Orissa, where the female period is four days,  including that of the goddess earth who menstruates once a year on Raja  Sankranti in Jyestha, the hot season of May–June; during those four days no  farmer may plow or use a cart and there must be no human sexual intercourse.  Regarding lunar symbolism it might be observed that after its absence the  moon is reborn on the fourth night.

4. ApSS 9.2.1-3. In Konasima this has been reported but not observed. 5. Knipe 1997 and 2003.

6. Cf. Kane (1968–75 2.1: 518 and n. 1208) citing the exact same ApDhS pas sage quoted from memory by Lanka. Trikandamandana 1.80c-81b, permit ting the wife whose husband is away to perform agni-hotra with the aid of  another, is cited by Frederick Smith (1987:  164f.). According to Konasima  pandits the replacement could be, for example, a qualified son or nephew.  Recent scholarly studies have illuminated the role of the patni. Stephanie  Jamison (1996:  289 n.295, 292 n.20) translates a mantra from Maitrayani  Samhita 1.4.3 addressed to the husband and wife during an isti: “You two  have become the yoked team of the worship.” Ellison Banks Findly mar shals texts highlighting “the naturalness of the marital unit” in Vedic ritu als (2002: 21) and Mary McGee (2002) convincingly summarizes the wife’s  adhikara to perform srauta rituals. Cf. also Leslie (1989: 102ff, 176ff.); H.-P.  Schmidt (1987).

9. Puberty rituals among Aiyar Brahmans in Kanyakumari District, Tami Nadu,  are well described with case studies in Vasumathi Duvvury (1991: 111–32); she  distinguishes between vaidika and laukika traditions and employs the methodol ogy of van Gennep to understand puberty as separation, marriage as transition,  childbearing as incorporation into the community of auspicious married women  (su-mangali). From her perspective a female is not “fully auspicious” (Tamil  naranja su-mangali) until she attains menopause and sees all her children mar ried and settled (215f). On puberty and first menstruation among Namputiri in  Kerala, M. Parpola (2000: 180–89). Cf. also N. N. Bhattacharyya 1980.

10. Further details on marriage rituals may be found in Kane (1968–75 2.1: 427– 541); R. B. Pandey (1969: 153–233); M. Parpola’s 2000 study of a Namputiri  family in Panjal, Kerala, is the most thorough ethnography of a living Vedic  community yet published; marriage and the lives of married women are cov ered on pp.  191–209; Duvvury (1991:  132–83); Ram Gopal (1983:  204–54);  R.  S. Khare (1976:  189–240); Baidyanath Sarasvati (1977:  114–205); Padfield  (1908:  94–118), covering Brahman and other marriages in Telugu-speaking  areas at the close of the nineteenth century.

11. Patrick Olivelle (1993:  45–53) discusses another version of this triple debt,  Satapatha Brahmana 1.7.2.1–6, one that also treats rna payments as avadana.  Analyzing a “theology of debts,” citing Charles Malamoud (1980:  41–43, tr.  1996) and others, he notes that rna can mean a fault, crime, or guilt as well as  debt. The association of debt and guilt in this context may have origins in the  Rg Veda. On the wider context of debt see Donald Davis (2010).

Konasima: an average longevity of 66.4 years for women, 63.2 years for men.  India was then ranked 139 of 195 nations. Modern medicine, a better diet, and  proliferation of hospitals and clinics have sharply increased longevity; between  1980 and 2000 there was an astonishing 90 percent increase in the number of  people in India who lived beyond 70.

17. Olivelle (1993: 161–82) makes clear the distinction between an early system of  career choice of one asrama from among the four and a “classical” system that  replaced it, with an individual moving sequentially through each one, student,  householder, forest dweller, renouncer. In the classical system, reduplication in  the last two, both of them meaning abandonment of house and village, essen

tially eliminated the forest dweller stage of life, one that is seldom mentioned  by Konasima pandits.

18. ApDhS 2.9.21–23 details rules for the samnyasin with no fire and the forest  hermit with one fire, both of them homeless wanderers begging for food. 19. Agehananda Bharati, an experienced renouncer-scholar, offers his own assess ment (1961: 161f.); cf. Ghurye (1964: 220–37).

Regarding the Tamil Aiyar Brahman widow, Duvvury (1991:  224–27) details  the pre-dawn stripping of the marriage thread on the eleventh day after her  husband’s death rather than the day of his cremation.

26. On details and case studies of the musi-vayanam: Knipe (2003). The report from  Tamil Nadu (Duvvury 1991:  226–27) concerns the funeral for an auspicious  Aiyar Brahman wife who dies before her husband, is dressed like a bride in  a bright colored sari, covered with flowers, and considered to be Mahalaksmi.  However, unlike the Godavari rite in which the deceased is sent to Gauri’s  heaven, the Aiyar rite described by Duvvury has no Brahman funerary priest

ess possessed by the spirit of the deceased and no presentations from natal and  marital female relatives who are the only attendees.

Michael Witzel 2000; cf. 1987, 1997a; James Mallory 1989. Other secondary  sources for the general study of Vedic ritual are plentiful; monographs on spe cific rituals are cited in notes below as each is discussed. The Srautakosa (SKE  and SKS for English and Sanskrit sections, respectively) ed. by C. G. Kashikar  and R. N. Dandekar was published in two “volumes,” 1958–95, each with mul tiple “parts,” for a total of eight books. The third and fourth projected volumes  did not appear. Kane’s History of Dharmasastra (1968–75) provides encyclopedic  coverage in five volumes, some also with two parts. Ranade 2006 has expanded  Sen 1978 and Renou 1947 with indispensable photos, line drawings, and tex tual citations. Among older general works that remain insightful resources  are Hillebrandt 1897; Bergaigne 1878–83; Levi 1898; Hubert and Mauss 1898  (Eng. tr. 1964); Oldenberg 1923; Keith 1925; Dumont 1927, 1939; Rodhe 1946.  More recent general studies include Potdar 1953; Renou 1954; Gonda 1965a,  1977, 1980; Kashikar 1968; Thite 1975; Knipe 1975; Malamoud 1976; Moody  1980; Krick 1982; Gopal 1983; Staal 1983; F. M. Smith 1987; B. K. Smith  1989; Sparreboom and Heesterman 1989; Patton 1994a, 1994b, 2004a, 2005;

Minkowski 1991; Oberlies 1998–99; Staal 2008; McClymond 2008. 2. 4.14.2a, Patrick Olivelle’s translation 1996: 134, emphasis added. 3. Bachelard 1964a: 7. Agni has been described by Jan Heesterman as the sacrifi cer’s “external soul” (1987: 223), his “alter ego” (1993: 27, 29).

4. On the implements used in grhya and srauta rites see the excellent photographs  and descriptions in Yajnayudhani, the Vaidika Samsodhana Mandala publica tion edited by T. N. Dharmadhikari in 1989; also Ranade 2006, an alphabetic  list by Sanskrit name; Tachikawa et  al. 2001:  41–47 and many photos; Sen  1978: 171–75; Ranade 1978 with photos and sketches following p. 447.

5. On the naksatra and adhana see the detailed analysis of Hertha Krick 1982: 9–38.  The naksatra are discussed further in segment 4 of this chapter. 6. No animal is sacrificed in the adhana, but present are both a yoked white horse  and a cart or “chariot” wheel that is rolled from the garha-patya to the ahavaniya as embers are transferred. Jan Heesterman sees vestiges of a more ancient pro gram in which Agni was transported by chariot, perhaps indicating “a warlike  expedition, especially when the accompanying mantras (referring to unnamed  enemies) are taken into consideration” (1987: 232); cf. Sparreboom 1985: 65ff.;  Krick 1982. As shown later, chariots play significant roles in several major sac rifices; cf. also Parpola 2005; 2012a: 249–50: Anthony 2007.

7. On the bondage of mutual hatred between sacrificers consider TS 1.1.9.8;  1.3.1.3; 1.5.7.6; 2.5.11.7; 2.6.4.2–4; etc.; cf. AV 10.6.1–35. ApSS 22.13 pre scribes the performance of the vighnana (hammer) sacrifice to kill an enemy  and elsewhere Apastamba provides numerous methods of using sorcery (abhi cara) against rival sacrificers as well as defensive techniques (cf. ApSS 2.20.1;  3.14.1–3). In The Broken World of Sacrifice Jan Heesterman observes, regarding

Notes 289

ancient sacrifice, it is “from beginning to end a conflict.” Competition among  sacrificers, he notes, reflects the continuing redistribution of material goods  necessary for life (1993: 33–41). On ritual rivalry, known by the Delta pandits as  srauta-kaksa, the naming of enemies, and a comparative study of Vedic sacrifi

cers and non-Brahman possession ritualists in the Godavari Delta, see Knipe,  “Ritual subversion . . .” 2004a. Cf. B. K. Smith 1996.

8. On the adhana (also known as agnya-dhana or agnya-dheya) see Krick 1982;  Sparreboom and Heesterman 1989; Moody 1980; Kane 1968–75: 2.2: 986–97;  Hillebrandt 1897: 105–6; Keith 1925: 316–18; SKE 1.1: 1–84; on punar-adheya Krick 1982: 314ff; Hillebrandt 1897: 109; Kane 1968–75: 2.2: 997–98. Theodore  Proferes (2007: 62–75) explores connections between the five peoples or tribes  of the RV and other texts and the five fires, races of humans, and directions  (four cardinal points plus the center).

9. Bodewitz 1976: 3; cf. 34–40, 144–46, 162–64. Bodewitz notes here the identifi cation of sacred fires with breath, prana, both cosmic and human; inhalation  and exhalation owning counterparts in sunrise and sunset.

10. Cited by Asko Parpola (1998: 227) in Bodewitz’s translation (1976: 157). 11. On agni-hotra, in addition to Bodewitz’s three volumes, see Parpola 1998: 227– 28; Brian Smith 1989:  5, 156–57; SKE 1.1:  85–198; Dumont 1927, 1964;  Kane 1968–75: 2.2: 998–1008; Hillebrandt 1897: 109–11; Keith 1925: 318–19;  McClymond 2008: 97–101.

12. The term darsa refers to the first “appearance” of the emerging new moon,  while a fortnight later the moon is purna, “full.” Monographs on these two  istis include Rustagi 1981, with sketches of ritual implements in chapter 10,  and Hillebrandt 1880. Cf. SKE 1.1: 211–501; Keith 1925: 319–21; Kane 1968–

290 Notes

21. Dumont 1954: 205; this introduces Dumont’s translation of TB 3.1.1–6. 22. Asko Parpola has aptly defined naksatra as “lunar marker stars” (1998: 239) along  with arresting insights on several asterisms including Rohini, marker of the  vernal and autumnal equinoxes, the festival times for Durga. Already in 1985  he had begun to connect Indus Valley seal symbols with Vedic patterns such as  the dhisniya fires, seven sages, and seven stars of Ursa major (1985: 60, 122–40). The Taittiriya ritual use of naksatra is outlined in TB. 3.1.4–6; BSS 28.3–4  including a recommendation that naksatra-isti should be done at least three  times in a life. Secondary sources on naksatra include Kane 1968–75: 5.1: 486– 536; Krick 1982:  3–38; Dumont 1954; SKE 1.1:  591–93. Regarding the nine  planets, nava-graha are discussed in Markel 1989 and Knipe 1995, the latter  with attention to Godavari Delta beliefs and practices among Hindus in gen eral. Several Veda pandits mentioned troublesome grahas; few praised benefi cent ones for their favors.

23. Cf. ApSS 6.30.14. Frederick Smith (1987: 168) notes that this may be done in  the absence of the sacrificer; Konasima pandits treasure this ritual enormously  and would not miss its delights.

24. On the agrayana see Meyer 1937 and the brief overviews of Kane 1968–75: 2.2.  827–29 (grhya), 1106–7 (srauta) and Ram Gopal 1983:  427–29 (grhya), 542  (srauta); Keith 1925:  323–24; Hillebrandt 1897:  119–20; SKE 1.1:  502–15.  Extraordinarily obtuse is Keith’s remark (1925: 2.323): “That [the agrayana] was  felt to be in any way sacramental, or even as inducing a special sense of com

munity, is not to be seen in the Vedic evidence.” The agrayana festival at the  time of Durga-puja is in fact the most cohesive of all ritual times for Veda pan dits and the wider Hindu populace and it is difficult to imagine this was not the  case in the ancient period.

On the catur-masya see also SKE 1.2: 646– 767; Einoo 1988; Bhide 1979 based on Hiranyakesi Srauta Sutra and its  Prayoga of Mahadeva Somayajin and including useful charts of hearth arrange ments with multiple vedis for the three different rites, 214–16; Thite 1969 and  1975:  55–76; Kane 1968–75:  2.2:  1091–106; Keith 1925:  321–23; Hillebrandt  1897: 115–19. Although Matthew Sayers does not take up the catur-masya rites  he convincingly situates the pinda-yajna and the earlier pinda-pitr-yajna in the  broad context of developing Vedic texts, including the Taittiriya srauta and grhya series (2013: 40–69); cf. D. R. Shastri 1963: 54.

Sources on the agni-stoma include Caland and Henry 1906; Kane 1968– 75: 2.2: 1132–203 with a diagram of fires and priests on the first page; Keith  1925: 326–32; Hillebrandt 1897: 124–34; Thite 1975: 49–55; SKE 2.1–3 covers  first the agni-stoma in Parts 1 and 2, pp. 1–435 and pp. 439–894, respectively,

and then the other soma sacrifices in Part  3, pp.  1–200 with appendices on  the sutras following, 201–80. V. G. A. Somayajulu, an industrious scholar at  Andhra University, Vishakhapatnam, completed his PhD thesis in 1991 under  the direction of Professor Akkubhatla Sharma. Somayajulu interviewed all the  ahitagni discussed here and others in Hyderabad as well as Krishna and Guntur  Districts. His thesis, submitted in cursive Sanskrit, remains unpublished, the  author having retired to live in Hyderabad.

38. Before asphyxiation became standard practice decapitation was normative.  Later in this chapter the agni-cayana is described with its foundation sacrifice of  male heads, originally placed in the first layer of the fire altar. A termite mound  turret and a clay replica of a human head now serve as fore-offerings, followed  by asphyxiated goats substituting for the decapitated man, horse, bull, ram, and  goat.

51. Rg Vedins with KSS employ these two terms quite differently with respect to  meters transposed in sastra recited by the hotr (vyudha) and a routine metrical  arrangement (samudha).

52. Malamoud 2004:  452. See Dumont 1951. For his twenty-day aruna-ketuka Baudhayana was followed by Baballa but considerable reliance was upon fam ily paddhati for details. At the end of his raja-suya section Baudhayana 12.8 has  a larger collection of sixteen waters, including water from dew, a whirlpool, and  bovine products such as milk, curds, ghee, and the aul of a cow.

56. Asko Parpola sees the 180-day intervals of the year-long sattra as equinoxes,  turning points of the sun, culminating on the Vivasvat (Sun) day and the  maha-vrata day. He also suggests that the maha-vrata and the asva-medha may  originally have been one ritual (1983: 49, 51).

misses it as “very strange” and probably “make-believe.”

59. The episode of Indra shattered by drinking soma stolen from Tvastr occurs in  TS 2.3.2.5–8. Not familiar to Konasima pandits are the details of VS 19–21 (e.g.,

Notes 293

19.93 where Sarasvati and the Asvins reconstruct Indra) and SB 5.5.4.1; 12.7.1– 9.3.16. Although they are distinctly different in substance and ritual preparation  TB 1.3.3.2 makes a united pair of male soma and female sura, a coincidentia  oppositorum also of light and darkness. Apastamba recommends an extra goat  sacrifice to Brhaspati in case the yajamana has previously vomited soma (ApSS  19.2.2); on the full sautramani see ApSS 19.1–10. Contemporay use of soma-lata appears to pose no threat of stomach illness. When tasted the dora found it to be  a bitter, nasty juice unless laced with honey and one with no psychotropic effect.

60. Sources on the sautramani include Thite 1975: 83–89; Kane 1968–75: 2.2: 1224– 28; Jamison 1991: 98–102; Rönnow 1929; Gopal 1983a: 166–67, 544–45; Keith  1925: 362–54; Dumont 1965; Hillebrandt 1897: 159–61; SKE 1.2: 899–943.

62. Usually these dialogues are labeled by translators “obscene.” Stephanie Jamison  (1996: 73) rightly prefers to call them “sexual riddles” and notes: “We must treat  these riddle dialogues as deeply serious attempts to approach and verbally har vest the mysterious forces released in sexual activity.”

63. Asko Parpola, the leading authority in comparative studies of the Indus Valley  seals and the Vedas, sees the Harappan water-buffalo sacrifice as the origin of  the later Vedic horse sacrifice (2012b: 11; 2004: 483–85, 494–507; cf.

66. This separation is not complete. For example, ApSS 8.13 contains pinda-pitr-yajna to be done in the saka-medha portion of seasonal rituals. BSS 3.10 and 4.32 include  pinda-pitr-yajna between attention to agni-hotra and agrayana. Nevertheless, both  Apastamba and Baudhayana have separate pitr-medha sutras, the former closely  following that of Bharadvaja. Cf. Gonda 1977: 616–21; Sayers 2013.

67. Analysis of this curious circumstance was presented to the Twelfth World  Sanskrit Conference in Helsinki 2003:  “Somidevamma:  The wife who con sumes soma in the Andhra Vaidika tradition.” This will appear in Knipe, Ritual  and Folklore in the Godavari Delta.

68. On RV 10.16.16 see O’Flaherty [Doniger] 1981: 46 nn. 17–18. There are textual  variants of losta-citi in the pitr-medha sutras containing practices reminiscent

of the maha-vrara and asva-medha, including sexually and socially transgres sive dialogue, musical instruments, singing, dancing, slapping the right thigh,  loosening hair, and fanning (in this case, the urn of bones). No living memory  supplies information regarding coastal Andhra performance of this version.  Kane 1968–75: 4: 251–53 volunteers that the rite was assurance to the deceased  of his wife’s continuing fidelity, a curious observation since the wife agreed to  sleep with a Sudra man for one or more nights. In the context of regenerating  life in bones a better explanation might be the arousal of powers of fertility by  realizing suppressed (and forbidden) desires. Once again it may be that certain  features from the pre-classical era have endured in last rites. Finally, it is always  important to note that women of the household insert numerous non-textual  procedures into rites for the dying and the dead.
