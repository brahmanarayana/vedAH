Gratitude goes out to numerous people along the way: Wendy Doniger, for  her astonishing productivity of books that enrich both mind and spirit; Asko  Parpola, for his encyclopedic knowledge of everything Vedic and pre-Vedic  plus his limitless generosity of scholarship; my former colleagues of many  years at the University of Wisconsin in Madison including Velcheru Narayana  Rao for initially directing me to the Godavari Delta not far from where he was  born; students in many years of graduate seminars; John Nemec and his semi 

nar students at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville; Griff Chausee,  John Cort, Laurie Patton, John Stavellis, Cynthia Talbot, Gautam Vajracharya;  my daughters Nicola Knipe, Viveka Öhman, and Jennifer Knipe for their valu able suggestions, and my wife, Susan T. Stevens, who was there in our bunga low by the Godavari River when this project was conceived and has remained  an unfailing guide throughout, always lending an archeologist’s eye for detail. 

In India the list of gracious and willing providers of assistance is enor mous and can only be partially acknowledged. It begins with M. V. Krishnayya,  Emeritus Professor of Philosophy and Religion at Andhra University in  Vishakhapatnam. This book is dedicated to him along with our ahitagni and  other Veda pandit friends and wives of many years. Thanks go as well to  field assistants K. V. S. Laksmi Narasamamba, Duvvuri Sita Ram Sastry, and  Duvvuri Girija Sankar. 

Gracious interview hours were granted by many not mentioned in the  book: Darbha Venkatesvara Avadhanulu, Dhulipala Ramachandra Sastri,  Kala Satyanarayana Sarma, Khandavalli Suryanarayana Sastri, Remella  Suryaprakasa Sastri, Susarla Venkatarama Sastri, Upadrasta Subrahmanya,  and Upadrasta Ganapati Sastri. Longtime friends have taught me the mantras  I needed to interiorize, the meanings of a ritual life, and so much else: Satya  Narayana Pandey, Laksmana Sastri, Indrakanti Subrahmanya Sastri, Sorapalli  Ramakrishna, Chellaboyina Apparao, Narayana Sastry (Bobby), and K. V. S.  Kotesvararao.xx Acknowledgments 

Gratitude is due also to the Graduate School of the University of  Wisconsin-Madison for field research grants, the American Institute for Indian  Studies in Delhi for Senior Fellowships supporting research in Andhra, and  the Government of India for continual visas. Thanks also to Cynthia Read,  David Joseph, Marcela Maxfield, and Charlotte Steinhardt for their efforts  to produce this book, and to Chris Cohen at Randolph College for generous  assistance with digital maps and photos. 

A particular note of gratitude goes to Willem Caland (1859–1932) and  Ganesh Thite of the University of Pune for their abilities in making editions  and minutiae of Apastamba texts accessible and sensible.
