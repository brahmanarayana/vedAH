october 3, 1980, was the author’s initial encounter with the Veda pandits  of Sriramapuram. An American professor of South Asian Studies from the  University of Wisconsin, accompanied by a professor of Philosophy from  Andhra University in Vishakhapatnam, walked unannounced down the sin 

gle lane of the quiet agrahara, a private Brahman hamlet leading off a dusty  road a mile from the nearest village. They were met with direct, curious,  unsmiling but not unfriendly gazes of several men and boys who were either  already sitting on, or gradually emerging onto an arugu, a Telugu word for  veranda, the platform meant for social exchange in front of each residence.  Their white stucco houses marched in two neat rows to flank the dirt path,  fourteen houses in all. These were proud, self-possessed, energetic faces. The  unexpected visitors identified themselves and were soon seated in the midst  of a circle of a dozen old and young men. The American explained that he was  seeking conversation with Veda pandits, particularly ahitagni, those who had  established the three Vedic fires in their homes, and that he had started in  the Amalapuram area but found no one still active. Suddenly the senior and  recognized spokesman for the agrahara, a tall, lanky elder with heavy glasses  on a lean face, pointed across the circle and announced “He is an ahitagni, he  is an ahitagni, and I am an ahitagni” (see Figure P.1).

An energetic three-hour discussion of Vedic texts  and rituals ensued, leading off three decades of engagement with the residents  of this and nearby agrahara. When a modest rupee honorarium was extended  to the senior ahitagni Baballa, following this initial unanticipated meeting,  he declined with an elegant, unforgettable phrase: “Your interest in Veda is  our daksina (ritual payment)!”This book highlights the essential features of  contemporary Vedic life by allowing ahitagni and other Veda pandits, their  wives, and their children to narrate personal experience. This is important  because their communities and their individual narrations, all noteworthy and

remarkable, are largely unknown to mainstream India. Certainly they are far  removed from Western perception. Outside of the subcontinent the general  reader of books about India rarely notices the Vedic tradition, and normally  considers it a strange and remote period that seems to have ended thousands  of years ago. This study explores a valuable living tradition. 

The four generations of ten families in this book represent a period of  rapid and far-reaching changes. Although they share textual and ritual bases,  no two pandits have had the same experience. Despite their relatively uniform  training in Veda there is no Vedic template to embrace them all. Any merit in  this survey may lie in the revelation of a great variety of personalities, experi 

ences, and attitudes. 

The visitors on that October day in 1980 were the author of this book  and his younger colleague, M.  V. Krishnayya, who shares in its dedication  and could truthfully be regarded as mediating Telugu pandit and diplomat,  one whose charm, energy, and easy humor in conversation elicited candid  and earnest response from men, women, and children of all strata of village  and urban coastal Andhra society. Born and raised in East Godavari District,  his Telugu dialect and training in Indian philosophy afforded direct access  that made this work possible. The pair returned to Sriramapuram and other

agrahara, villages, and towns of the delta over the years to record the voices  of these exceptional people. In Sriramapuram the pair was sometimes teased,  erasing distinctions of color and culture, as “Rama and Krishna paying a visit.”  The book is about the reciters and sacrificers, their wives and families, their  crucial links to a 3,700-year-old tradition that India regards as its founda 

tional culture. It is their voices that should be heard. Although it may appear  unusual to skirt their use, first-person pronouns seem intrusive in the distin guished company of these Godavari voices. At times for clarity of context the  commonly used Telugu word dora, Foreigner or Westerner, is a third-person  reference to the author. 

Field interviews, well over a hundred in all, frequently lasting for three  hours, were recorded, transcribed, edited into field notes, and later entered into  computer documents. On some occasions the author was the sole interviewer  and at other times Professor Krishnayya, Emeritus Chair of the Philosophy  Department of Andhra University in Visakhapatnam, undertook interviews  in Rajahmundry, Annavaram, Simhacalam, and Vijayawada when the author  was not in India. Lakshmi Narasamamba, PhD, was another invaluable assis 

tant, particularly in her role of entering residential interiors to converse with  women. When e-mail came into vogue in the late 1990s it was the youthful  Duvvuri Sita Ram Sastry who supplied updated information as well as inter view assistance in 2005. A number of other research associates and assistants  graciously gave their time and energy, and they are remarked by name in the  Acknowledgments. 

One of the obstacles for the general reader of articles and books on Vedic  studies is the formidable array of technical terms. At the end of the book there  is a substantial Glossary of Sanskrit and Telugu words with proper diacriti cal marks. A few dozen terms, all Sanskrit, could be considered essential for  a basic understanding of the flow of Vedic tradition, including the texts and  rituals of contemporary Veda pandits in coastal Andhra. These are briefly dis cussed in Chapter 2, a chapter that might serve as a resource when they recur.  All terms in italics are Sanskrit unless noted as Telugu or another language. 

Chapter 1 introduces the reader to the Godavari Delta, an area that has  received scant attention in studies of the subcontinent, with details on the  geographic and historic character of this beautiful, mobile triangle of many  rivers and streams, a region much prized for its productivity and therefore a  locus—even in the modern era—of constant political contention. Figures 0.1  through 0.6 are scenes in or close to Konasima. Interlined with history are  sketched-in references to the mythic, ritual, and symbolic backdrop of a Vedic  presence in the delta, leading into Chapter 2 that opens up the meaning of a  life lived “in the Veda.” This chapter, with presentations of both textual and 

xviii Preface 

ritual progression, is essentially an introduction to Vedic tradition as it is  expressed in coastal Andhra, one of the two or three dominant Vedic areas  of India and the last to perform both soma and animal sacrifices in authentic  fashion. 

Chapter 3 is a selection of capsule biographies of more than a score of  pandits and fire sacrificers in ten families. These families, stretching now  over four generations, illustrate the diversity of Vedic careers as well as  their remarkable achievements. The next four chapters return to a more  detailed examination of the Vedic life in progress outlined in Chapter 2,  beginning with Chapter 4 and the young student’s learning of the Taittiriya  Samhita from his father, grandfather, or older brother. Marriage and even 

tual residence with a wife lead to the householder stage of life, the subject  of Chapter 5. Women’s lives, children and life-cycle rituals, the means of  livelihood, and an inevitable final passage into retirement, death, and the  beyond are further topics here. 

Chapter 6 reviews the ritual life introduced in Chapter 2 and sketches  in a more nuanced portrait of an ahitagni and his wife, routine daily, fort nightly, and annual offerings in their three-fire household, the initiatory  soma and animal sacrifice, further great sacrifices, and the special funerals  required for soma sacrificers and their wives. In conclusion, the Epilogue  following Chapter 6 sums up the modern experience of ahitagni and other  Veda pandits and the marked cultural, economic, educational, and other  changes from the times of those fathers and grandfathers selected for biog raphies in Chapter 3.
