      <description>The bridge over the Billakurru canal is packed tight with all imaginable colors flowing in brilliant sun, a kaleidoscope of scintillating saris and glistening bangles on girls and women thronging the road toward Jaganathota. It is the long-awaited Tadithota festival, an assembly of gods from fourteen villages in a spacious palm orchard some three miles from Sriramapuram. Shouting troupes of men lug giant prabha, garlanded bamboo and papier-mâché floats for every village god and goddess, each grand enough to carry several riders along.</description>

      <description>A marriage (vivaha) is a splendid spectacle, everyone liberated from routines, moving about with the electricity of a holiday outing, brilliant costumes, some outrageous colors, an aroma of spices loading the air as Cooking Brahmans labor to prepare vast quantities of food. And yet a marriage also means solemn rituals with long midnight hours of mantras, fire offerings, seemingly end
less recitations of pedigrees. “Marriage is performed out of paramartha, the highest truth, and it must be continued always with sraddha, faith.</description>

      <description>In the center of the main room of the spacious and immaculate new house a three-month-old baby is constantly rocked side-to-side in a wooden cradle by his grandmother, Maruti, then swung vigorously head-to-toe in a green hammock suspended from the ceiling. He sends out no cry for Dramamine. Maruti has just performed a minor rite, something like an extra samskara, life-cycle rite. The baby started making fists with his hands, as if squeezing imaginary balls, so relatives came to be fed with fist-sized lumps (Telugu mudda) of cooked rice.</description>

      <description>Long walks on rain-drenched roads from Nedunuru to Vyaghresvaram allow the traveler to see the ways the local folk make their living. Coffee-colored mud trying with every step to suck chappals from feet, bursts of showers send ing rivulets into shoulder ponds, jade leaves of tapioca gleaming in sporadic sunlight, scenes heightened every few hundred meters by vistas of a score of women bent over rice transplants, their brilliant red, yellow, and blue saris shouting over the passionate green of the fields.</description>

      <description>In his green-canopied house under beckoning palms in Nedunuru Lanka was asked how he was feeling. “Jirna!” he replied, summoning the Telugu and Sanskrit word for digestion. Never a complainer, he was not indicating stomach or bowel problems but a larger, insoluble one. “I am being digested by Time” was his message. When he used the familiar metaphor of food for the untreatable process of aging he might have been reflecting the Taittiriya Upanisad refrain he learned about the age of ten: aham annam, aham annam, “I am food, I am food!</description>

      <title>6 Death and Beyond</title>

      <description>The subject of death and dying has its own folklore in India, and here the Veda pandits are not immune. To begin, the vocabulary of thanatos, like that of eros, is circumvented to every extent possible. Terms for the burning ground (smasana), cremation (antyesti), ancestor rituals (sraddha), and funeral priest (apara-vetta) all require pronominal circumlocutions (“there,” “then,” “those,” “that one,” respectively). The word for widow (vedhava) is unspeakable. Unlike the easy discussion of Vedas and Sutras, pandits are uncomfortable talking about current funerals with procedures found in texts separated from auspi cious rites of passage.</description>
