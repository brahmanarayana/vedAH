      <description>Due to the constant self-landscaping of the two rivers archeologists obtain few results from combing within the Godavari or Krishna deltas. Inland well west of the deltas, great ash mounds of burnt cow dung reveal tempo rary settlements of Neolithic cattle herders. Also dotted through the interior are numerous megalithic tombs. It is estimated that Telugu developed as a discrete Dravidian spoken language in Andhra early in the first millennium bce.</description>

      <description>The boasts of “southern” supremacy by Satakarni I and Kharavela would no doubt have been ridiculed by kings and chieftains farther south. The Ceras (Keralas) on the west coast, the Colas who gave their name to the east coast (Coromandal, the mandala of Colas), and the Pandyas in between, competed for power over the territory during the early centuries ce, a pot
pourri of kingdoms controlling villages and extracting revenue not only in Tamil Nadu, “land of the Tamils,” but also parts of the northern Deccan and up the Kalinga coast.</description>

      <description>In the last few centuries bce Tamil speakers began to compose poetry and prose that foreshadowed Sangam era classics of the first three centuries ce. Gradually Tamil had taken on vocabulary and themes from Sanskrit. By the close of the first millennium ce two more Dravidian languages, Telugu and Kannada, followed suit with literary forms and sizable input from Sanskrit. In the eleventh century Telugu classical poetry received its template from the reworking of the first two and a half books of the Sanskrit Mahabharata by Nannaya, a task continued on palm leaves in the thirteenth century by Tikkana, another formidable and creative poet.</description>

      <title>4 The Kakatiya Dynasty at Warangal</title>

      <description>until 1322
Warangal, midway between middle stretches of the Godavari and Krishna riv ers, had become the hub of the Kakatiya dynasty from the eleventh to the beginning of the fourteenth centuries as the center of political control moved inland from the coast. The most ambitious of its kings was Ganapati who ruled more than sixty years c.1198–1262, corralling the two deltas (the enlarged meaning of “Vengi”) within his kingdom. Subjugation of the coast occurred on Ganapati’s way south to reduce Kanci in Tamil Nadu, one of his many victo rious battles having been fought at Pithapuram in the Godavari Delta.</description>

      <description>The grandson of Ganapati was Pratapa Rudra who ruled successfully, by most accounts, from 1289 until the Delhi Sultan Ala-ud-din dispatched armies to subdue the Kakatiya region. Sieges were laid, bargains were struck, but finally the well-fortified city of Warangal and abundant Kakatiya armies were no match for the battle-hardened cavalry tactics and leadership of Ulugh Khan. Warangal fell in 1322 to the fifth successive Sultanate invasion and a captive king Pratapa Rudra was under transport toward Delhi when he died near the Namada River, perhaps by his own hand.</description>

      <description>A powerful rival to both the Hindu Kakatiyas of Warangal and the Muslim Bahmani kingdoms arose in Karnataka as Vijayanagara, one of the largest for tifications in Asia with an eventual ten square miles within massive walls. Lasting for almost three centuries, the “city of victory” dominated the center of the southern peninsula from Hampi on the Tungabhadra River, a southern tributary of the Krishna. In 1327, Muhammad Tughluq conquered the Kampili dynasty that had succeeded the Hoysalas in Karnataka and thereby completed</description>

      <description>Greek and Roman merchant ships in the last centuries bce and early centuries CE most certainly viewed and perhaps explored the Krishna and Godavari del tas along the Coromandal coast. European colonization of the subcontinent, however, did not begin until well after Vasco da Gama landed four ships at Calicut on the Kerala coast in 1498. The early arriving Portuguese concen trated on India’s Arabian Sea coast. A century later the east coast on the Bay of Bengal was the target of Dutch, Danish, and French traders as well as the even tually all-encompassing English.</description>

      <description>Everywhere on domestic, business, and civic walls, and especially on trees at crossroads and river banks, there are posters and statues of divine beings— Hanuman, Ganesa, all possible avatara of Devi, Siva, or Visnu, and the occasional god-man or god-woman stepping back from history into myth—Shirdi Sai Baba or Sarada Devi, for example. Images of two male figures with historical focus are ubiquitous in the delta, as indeed they are in most of India.</description>

      <description>The historian of Andhra, P. Raghunanda Rao, credits English education for intellectual and social reforms leading to the “awakening of Andhra” from medieval stupor.31 The University of Madras originated in 1857 and by 1873 a government college for the Godavari Delta was established in Rajahmundry. Labeled by the Veda pandits huna-vidya, the practice of the Huns (a heavy-handed reference to British colonials), the Brahmans were wary of an educational system that interfered with traditional Vedic culture.</description>
