title = "4 The Kakatiya Dynasty at Warangal"

+++

until 1322 

Warangal, midway between middle stretches of the Godavari and Krishna riv ers, had become the hub of the Kakatiya dynasty from the eleventh to the  beginning of the fourteenth centuries as the center of political control moved  inland from the coast. The most ambitious of its kings was Ganapati who  ruled more than sixty years c.1198–1262, corralling the two deltas (the enlarged  meaning of “Vengi”) within his kingdom. Subjugation of the coast occurred  on Ganapati’s way south to reduce Kanci in Tamil Nadu, one of his many victo rious battles having been fought at Pithapuram in the Godavari Delta.

The Godavari Delta 13 

The Kakatiyas divided Andhra into nadu, regions. Vengi nadu, the two  great river deltas, could boast 16,000 villages.13 Portions of regions, or coun ties, were called sima (as in Kona-sima), kotta, or sthala. Kakatiya rule wit nessed the growth of large temple towns, heavily trafficked pilgrim routes,  popularity of sacred vows (vrata), dedications of Siva linga, circumambulations  of sacred hilltops, and increased numbers of Telugu inscriptions. 

Draksarama temple in the Godavari Delta with eleventh- and twelfth-century  inscriptions is the oldest and most famous of the five designated Saiva arama,  pleasure grove residences of deities. The temple’s name is a corruption of  Daksa arama, the grove where the god Daksa tried but failed to perform his  infamous soma sacrifice, frequently described in the Puranas. Although mar 

ried to Sati, Daksa’s daughter, Siva was not invited to the great yajna. A shamed  Sati immolated herself and Siva erupted into his horrendous manifestation  as Virabhadra to destroy the sacrifice. A powerful cult of Virabhadra as lord  of enraged, deceased children exists in the delta today and no one imagines  performing a Vedic sacrifice near Draksarama. The temple there is the resi 

dence of Bhima (Rudra), a form of Rudra-Siva, and the universal goddess as  Manikyambika, one of India’s eighteen Sakti pitha.14 The grove is the site of  a poem by the poet Srinatha, famous for his translations of Sanskrit kavya into Telugu, and the poet does not fail to mention goddesses Gogalamma,  Nokalamma, Mandatalli, and Ghattyambika. 

Meditation centers (matha) like those attributed to Sankara and Ramanuja  also increased in the Kakatiya period, including one so secluded on the tiny  island of Pattisam that it is reached only by boat from either the Rajahmundry  or Kovvur banks of the Godavari. Despite its inaccessibility it is one of the five  great Saiva retreats of India, in the august company of Srisaila, Kalahasti, Kasi  (Varanasi), and Kedara.
