title = "3 The Emergence of Telugu Literature"

+++

In the last few centuries bce Tamil speakers began to compose poetry and  prose that foreshadowed Sangam era classics of the first three centuries ce.  Gradually Tamil had taken on vocabulary and themes from Sanskrit. By the  close of the first millennium ce two more Dravidian languages, Telugu and  Kannada, followed suit with literary forms and sizable input from Sanskrit.  In the eleventh century Telugu classical poetry received its template from  the reworking of the first two and a half books of the Sanskrit Mahabharata  by Nannaya, a task continued on palm leaves in the thirteenth century by  Tikkana, another formidable and creative poet.11 Although both Nannaya  and Tikkana were Brahmans, Veda pandits or Brahmans as a class did not  monopolize the proliferation of Telugu literary works. Also in the thirteenth  century, Palkuri Somanatha produced the Basava Purana collection of leg ends of Virasaiva (Lingayata) saints who rejected Vedic textual authority, class  and caste hierarchy, funerary rites, and the whole enterprise of sacrifice. One  saint declared that his dog could chant the Vedas better than Brahman pan 

dits and the dog confirmed this.12 The other great Sanskrit epic also appeared  in a Telugu version in the fruitful thirteenth century only a few decades after  the Tamil Ramayana, the version composed by the poet Kampan. 

“First poet” and first Telugu grammarian Nannaya had enjoyed the patron age of king Rajaraja Narendra in Rajahmundry (medieval Rajamahendri) on  the Godavari after the Eastern Calukyas emerged phoenix-like in another  dynasty of their off and on again four-hundred-year run until the tenth cen tury and conquest by an energetic Cola king Rajaraja I (r. 985–1015). Rajaraja  was succeeded by his son Rajendra I (r. 1012–44). Rastrakuta chiefs as well  as other warring communities on the fringes of Vengi made shifts of power  nearly continuous.
