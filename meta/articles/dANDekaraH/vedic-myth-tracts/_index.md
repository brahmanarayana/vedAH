R. N, Dandekar : Select Writings I  
VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS  

## Intro
Professor Dr. R. N. DANDEKAR completes his seventy years on the 17th of March 1979, and we are glad to present to the lovers of Indology this first Volume of his "Select Writings ” on this very happy occasion, 

It is not necessary to describe here the long and meritori ous services rendered by Prof. DANDEKAR to Indology and Sanskritic studies. They are, indeed, too well known. Apart from his writings which have appeared in book form, the articles and papers which he has contributed to various Journals from time to time are quite numerous. It was felt that it would be very helpful if some select ones of these papers were collected and made available to students of Indology in handy volumes. These papers are valuable because of their variety, comprehensiveness, and authoritative pronouncements. The present Volume contains Prof. DANDEKAR's papers relating to Vedic Mythology. 

We thought of bringing out this Volume on the 71st Birthday of Prof. DANDEKAR, We have to thank Prof. DANDEKAR for having kindly agreed to our request in this respect. We have also to thank the authorities of the Bhandarkar Institute Press for their uniform courtesy while the Volume was through the Press. 

We take this opportunity of wishing Prof. DANDEKAR excellent health and long life to continue to render service to Indology and to bless and inspire his pupils.

At the cordial insistence of several friends and through the good offices of Professor Dr TG MAINKAR, the first volume of my Select Writings is being published today. It contains some papers relating to Vedic Mythology written by me in the course of the last nearly forty years. They are reproduced here, without much revision, in the chronological order of their first publication Though I may have modified my views on some minor points, my main theses remain substantially unchanged. 

A word of sincere appreciation is due to the Bhandarkar Institute Press for its efficient and expeditious work I am grateful to Shri A N GOKHALEY of the BORI for his meticulous proof reading and to Dr G U THITE for the 

The publishers have all along been quite considerate and cooperative
