THE SANVĀDASŪKTA IN THE ATHARVAVEDA 
The Samvadasūktas or dialogue-hymns constitutc one of the distinctive features of Rgvedic hymnody. Various views have been put forth by scholars regarding the genesis and nature of these hymns. OLDENBERG, for iastance, speaks of the ancient Akhyānas or narratives made up of prose and verse and suggests that only the verse-portions of some of such narratives, which were perhaps supplemented by extempore prose additions by the narrator, are preserved in the form of the so-called Samvāda sūktas. He, therefore, characterises these hymns as ākhyāda hymns. CHARPENTIER, however, regards these hymns as pieces of epic poetry which do not need any additional prose.* OLDEN BERG's Akhyāna-theory is rejected, among others, by HERTEL and VON SCHROEDER, who look upon these hymns as frag ments of ritual dramas. W. H. RIDGEWAYS who emphasizes the religious origin of drama, HILLEBRANDT, WINDISCH, ind Sylvain LÉVI according to whom the Samvadasūktas are like some sort of rough sketches of drama, support the Vedic drama heory, While accepting the essential dramatic character of the Samvādasūktas and the probability that they presuppose some kind of Drśya entertainment, some scholars have expressed doubt as to their connection with ritual. 
There is also the suggestion - which can be hardly accepted - that the Sanvādasūktas are merely the result of the Vedic poets'

endeavour for greater literary effect through the exploitation of different speech-forms.10 Recently it has been pointed out that OLDENBERG's Akhyāna-theory is fuodamenatlly sound and that old Ākhyāna-verses are quoted in the Rgveda with a view to putting them to magical use by means of the secondary additions to them of appropriate spells, 11

In the present context, it is not intended, nor is it necessary, to subject these various theories to a critical examination. Suffice it to say that even a casual study of most of the so-called Sam vādasūktas would indicate that those hymns were essentially of the nature of ancient ballads. GELDNER has described them as lyrical poems with epical subject matter and dramatic lay-out." Like ballads, these hymns are usually made up partly of direct speech, whereby the bard either himself assumes the roles of the different characters in the story which is being depicted and speaks out their speeches presumably with suitably varyiog articulation of rhetorically addresses some of those characters, and partly of narration in the third person. These hymos are further characte rised by such features as repetition, ellipsis, absence of proper sequence of stanzas, impromptu additions, and parenthesis, which are common to oral poetry like ballad. On the basis of their central themes, one may broadly classify these ballads as histo rical, mythical, ritualistic, speculative, etc. 
As against the RV which has several Samvādasūktas, the AV contains only one Samvādasūkta. It is the eleventh hymo 10 the fifth Kānda of the Saunaka-Samhitā of that Veda. It is well known that, unlike the RV-Samhitā, authorship is not the criterion which governs the arrangement of the AV-Samhita. AS a matter of fact, in respect of most of the hymns of the Ar, the authorship is indicated by the mention of the class of

the AV-priests, such as Atharvan, Brahman, and Angiras, the 
proper name of the Rsi being but rarely mentioned. The size of 
· the hymns secms to have been regarded, in many cases, as the norm for the arrangement of the AV-Samhiti. The fifth Kānda is said to belong to the first grand division of the AV. It consists of thirty-one hymns which are made up of 376 stanzas. Accord ing to the Anukramani, the hymns in this Kānda are assumed Bormally to contain eight stanzas each; but actually only two hymns (namely, the ninth and the tenth, which, however, are rather of the nature of pary āj a-sūk tas than artha-sūhtas) are of this normative length 
The eleventh hymn in the fifth Kāņda of the AV, which contains eleven stanzas, is constituted of a dialogue between Varuṇa and Atharvan. Incidentally, the portion of the commen tary (which is traditionally ascribed to the authorship of Sāyana) on this Kānda is not available. As for the ancillary literature, the Vartānasūtra does not quote this hymn at all, while the Kausikasūtra mentions it only once (12.1) in connection with a rite for general welfare. But the viniyoga prescribed in the Kausikasūtra seems to have hardly any relevance to the subject matter of the hymn. 
The gist of the hymn is briefly as follows: Varuņa had bestowed upon Atharvan the gift of a cow,15 which he later wanted to revoke. Atharvan, on his part, seeks to propitiate Varuṇa and to convince him of his being worthy of the gift. Thereupon, Varuṇa, satisfied with Atharvan's pleading of his case, returos the cow to him, and, to boot, assures him of his eternal friendsbip. It has already been pointed out that Atharvan is not the name of any specific person. It rather stands for a class of priests closely associated with the AV.18 As against this, the

present dialogue, wbich presupposes a specific context, requires a specific person, belonging to the Atharvan class of priests, as a correspondent of Varuṇa 17 The various indications in and about this hymn point to that person being Maitrāvaruni Vasistha 
For one thing, there is the tradition that Vasistha, though a seer of the RV. was well versed in the Atharvadic lore and practices He was, therefore, regarded as being eminently suited for the office of the priest belonging to the AV The Atharvanic priestcraft can be viewed in its two main aspects, namely, ritua listic and socio political It has to be remembered that, in the initial stages, the AV was not included in the sacred Trayi and that the priests of the Yajurveda (the Adhvaryu ), the RV (the Hot), and the Samaveda ( the Udgāts) shared among themselves the entire gamut of a sacrificial performance When, however, the claim of the AV as Brahmaveda18 came to be duly recognized,

a place was made for the priest of that Veda in the scheme of the Vedic ritual. That priest was called Brahman (masc.)29 But, since there had remained no specific ritualistic duty which could be assigned to the Brahman, he was entrusted with the overall supervision and superintendence of the ritual procedure. And it s exactly in this capacity that Agastya urged the Pratṣds (that is, the Tștsus) to receive Vasiṣṭha, for, as Agastya emphasized, Vasiṣṭha would "support the supporter of Ukthas (the Hotr) and the supporter of Sīmans (the Udgāts), (and he would also support him who) is the supporter of the Soma-crushing stone (the Adhvaryu ), and (he alone) would speak with authority in front of all of them." That the Brahmatva or the Atharvanic ritualistic priestcraft was Vasistha's forte is thus well-established. 
The priest of the AV, in his socio-political capacity, was called Purohita.21 And Vasistha is glorified in the RV, parti

(Continued from the previous page) deliberately to assert the importance of their lore and ritual. This their attitude may be said to have become more aggressive in the course of timc unul they alipost weat to the extremc of claiming the superiority of their Veda to the ohter Vedas. While this attitude had been developing, there was also becoming cvident another current of thought, which was quite independent of the current of thought which had given rise to the attitude mentioned above. It was gradually being realised that, Crom the point of view of the highest knowledge, the Trayl was, after all, limited in scopc. Therefore, a more comprehensive, all inclusive, and even transcendental "Inowledge" came to be thought of; it was called Brahman. As the Taittiriya-Sarita 7.3.1.4 has stated : parimila pārcah parmitani samani parımılanr sajūty athai 'stasyai 'ad into na isti yad brahma. The two above-mentioned currents of thought subscquently coalesced with the result that the aggressive protagonists of the AV claimed that thcir Veda dealt with this limitless Brahman — that it was the Brahmaveda. Cl. Gopatha-Br. 3.4 : clad oai bhayıs thah brahma jad bhrgeanligirasah. On account of this character of the AV, it also came to be known as Jataveda, Jātavidya, or Sarvavidya (that is, "the lore of all being"). Tor Sarvavidyā, çf. TBr III. 10.11.4.

cularly in the context of the Dasarājña, as the Purohita par excellence.22 The purohiti (or the priestcraft) of the Titsus, whose leader Vaṣistha was, is said to have proved most efficacious in that war.23 The Taittiriya-Samhitā (IIJ. 5. 2. 1) stresses Vasiṣṭha's pre-eminence in both the aspects of the Atharvanic priestcraft - ritualistic and socio-political - in the following single unequivocal statement: tato vasistha-purolulāh prajāk prājāyanta iasmad väsisiho brahmi kāryah prar 'va jayate. Vasistha, accord ingly, is the Atharvan: his identity with Atharvan of AV V. 1124 may thus be regarded as being clearly indicated.25 
Secondly, the peculiar kind of relationship between Varuṇa and Atharvan, as envisaged in AV V. 11, would unmistakably remind one of the relationship between Varuṇa and Vasistha as reflected in the seventh Mandala of the RV, particularly in the group of hymns relating to Varuṇa ( 86-89). Indeed, as I have suggested elsewhere, Vasistha may be said to have originally professed special loyalty to the Varuṇa-cult, though, when a conflict between the ancient Varuṇa-cuit and the new Indra-cult became imminent, he exhibited a very practical and realistic attitude and deliberately sought to co-ordinate and harmonize the two religious cults.28 
THE SAMVĀDASŪKTA IN THE ATHARVAVEDA 
161 
elements of the classical doctrine of Bhakti are more or less distinctly adumbrated in Vasistha's hymns to Varuṇa.37 One such element is the close personal relationship - not unoften oscillat ing between love and displeasure, union and estraogement, which fact verily lends to that relationship a fine human touch - which Vasiṣṭha claims with Varuṇa. And it is exactly this kind of Telationship which is presupposed in the present dialogue between Varuṇa and Atharyan, 
Not only this. Just as Vasiṣṭha looked up to Varuṇa as bls special god -- as the god with whom he sought to be united in Bhaktize - Varuṇa too, on his part, made Vasiṣṭha the recipient of his special grace. Indeed, Vasistha owed his very Rṣibood to Varuņa's grace.29 This is paraphrased by another statement, which is particularly relevant to our preseat discussion, namely that Varuṇa initiated Vasistha into the mystery of the threefold seven names of the cow' who symbolized the magically potent Vak. Now in view of what has already been said above about Vasistha and Atharvan, there should be hardly any doubt that the initiation of Vasiṣṭha by Varuṇa into the mystery of the twenty one names of the cow mentioned in RV VII, 87. 4 and the gifting of a cow to Atharvan by Varuṇa implied in AV V. 11 refer to one and the same episode.

[This is the speech of Varuṇa. (a) For Varuṇa as the great Asura, see: DANDEKAR, " Asura Varuṇa," Vedic Mytho logical Tracts, 28-67. (b) Haraye. does it refer to Varuṇa's wearing a gold-coloured mantie or a golden plate as a sign of imperial majesty ? Cf.

Those words, no doubt, imply a mild reproach. Prśni here symbolises the magically potent vāk. See the introductory remarks, Punarmagha is variously interpreted: (1) ROTH (Ueber den AP, 9) Traaslates it with greedy'; (11) punarmagha may mean one who re-bestows a gift upon another, the implication being that he first takes it back from the person upon whom it was originally bestowed; (iii) punarniaghatva is read as one word meaning re-bestowal, and is understood as the object of acikitsih; (iv) Atharvan deliberately uses the epithet in order to praise (flatter) Varuṇa, anticipating that Varuṇa would re-bestow the gift upon him alone. In all cases, the underlying idea is that of a revoker of gift. I

[Varuņa continues. It is rather unusual jn a Vedic Sanvāda sūkta that the speech of one and the same speaker extends over three continuous stanzas. Varuṇa here points out that, if any one could truly claim to be Kavi and Jätavedas, it was he alone. * It is further suggested that, if any one else were to put forth such a claim, it would disturb the order which it was for Varuṇa, as administrator of the cosmic law Rta, to establish and maintain (note the significance of dharisye).

| Varuṇa speaks. He replies to Atharvan's query, in the form of a riddle - of a Brahmodya. (c) In view of the context, it is necessary to change varuna (voc. sing.) to varunah (nom. sing.). Varuņa unfolds the cosmogonic mystery to Atharvan, Cf. RV VII. 88.2 cd, where Varuņa is said to have presented before Vasiṣṭha the cosmic mystery of light and darkness. (de) These two Padas, which are in no way connected with Varuṇa's unfolding of the cosmogonic mystery, may be understood as an impromptu addition made by the bard himself rather than as a part of Varuņa's speech. They, indeed, constitute an interesting poetic device. As suggested in c, Varuṇa is to be supposed, to have explained to Atharvan Vasiṣṭha, in the fourth and the fifth Padas, the real significance of ab. But, since that knowledge is essentially esoteric, it has to be kept secret from unqualified people. Cf. RV VII. 87. 4 cd : vidvān padasya gulya na vocad yugāya vipra uparāya śikṣan. The space of the two Padas, d and e, which should have contained Varuṇa's exposition of the mystery, would have, accordingly, to be left blank. But the bard avoids this by inserting these two "filler Pādas. They do not belong to the main theme of the dialogue, but are of the nature of popular sayings. It is this kind of material of common vogue and general import - benediction or expres sion of good wishes or imprecation (as in the present case) - which is usually employed by way of a 'filler'. Such fillers (as, in modern parlance, " May God bless you," “God save the King." "Damn it," etc.) are inserted to indicate several things, such as the speaker's wantiog to remember something or his wanting to avoid mentioning something explicitly, etc. We have to imagine that, during the interval when the bard uttered the trite sayings in Padas d and e, Varuṇa secretly imparted to Atharvan the esoteric &nowledge. The choice of the particular
