My answer to a question asked in #vedists about war-cries in the Véda: The Mántra-s do mention war-cries or at least war-noises several times (_krándas_ R̥V 2.12.8, 6.25.4, 10.38.1, 10.121.6; _ākrandá_ AV 12.1.41; _bhára-hūti_ R̥V 1.129.2, 5.48.4, 8.63.12). Unfortunately, there is no dialogue I've encountered in any Mántra or Brā́hmaṇa that is explicitly indicated to be a war-cry. However, there are some invocations that seem to serve almost as war-cries. Thus the formula recited alongside the beating of war-drums (dundubhí-s, TB 1.3.6.2) before the chariot-race of the vāja-péya: 

> **Índrāya vā́caṁ vadata—Índraṁ vā́jaṁ jāpayata—Índro vā́jam ajayit!**  
> "To Índra raise your voices—make Índra win the prize—Índra hath won the prize!" (TS 1.7.8.3). 

Especially the first two could make for good war-cries. Several other formulæ used in the vāja-péya could also serve the rôle, but this seemed the most pertinent in its application. Another pertinent war-cry could be what was spoken by Bharádvāja at the Battle of Ten Kings (JB 3.244): 

> **Ā́ na Índro hávaṁ gamiṣyati. Jeṣyā́ma imáṁ saṁ-grāmám!**  
> "Índra will come to our call. We will win this battle!" 

This occurs in a variety of tenses, e.g. _ā́ na Índro hávam agamat_ "Índra is come…" and _jáyāma saṁ-grāmám_ "let us win…".
