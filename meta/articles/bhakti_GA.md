The arrogant V1s & the true devotee of questionable heritage trope: 

- kavaSa ailUSa who was expelled by the RSis from a sattra on account of his maternal heritage (she was a dAsa woman; I suspect druhyu heritage). Expelled to the desert & suffering from thirst he sees the aponaptrīya sūkta and in the desert, the waters of the sarasvatI run to him.

- The innocent, naive devotee whose silly actions still please the deity: kaNNappa nAyanmAr's spitting water on rudra as ablution to a creative mind, can be said to be prefigured in the story of apālā who chews the soma plant with her teeth to press out the juice indra!!

- The trope of the devotee who risks everything for his cherished deva: could be said to be prefigured in the story of Rjrashva who, seeing a she-wolf (and recognizing it as the divine animal it was; I.e. Sent by the ashvinau), offered a hundred sheep to satiate it and was blinded by his father as a consequence! However, the ashvinau, pleased with him, gave back his eyes.

> The motif of Ashvinau restoring eyesight appears in the itihasa and the puranas in two other stories - cyavana and upamanyu.

Also, 'न ऋते श्रान्तस्य सख्याय देवाः'
इति ऋक्-संहितायाम् उद्घोषितः । 

Not to mention para-vedic roots of atimArga shaiva-s.
