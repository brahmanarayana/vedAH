### Preface 

october 3, 1980, was the author’s initial encounter with the Veda pandits  of Sriramapuram. An American professor of South Asian Studies from the  University of Wisconsin, accompanied by a professor of Philosophy from  Andhra University in Vishakhapatnam, walked unannounced down the sin 

gle lane of the quiet agrahara, a private Brahman hamlet leading off a dusty  road a mile from the nearest village. They were met with direct, curious,  unsmiling but not unfriendly gazes of several men and boys who were either  already sitting on, or gradually emerging onto an arugu, a Telugu word for  veranda, the platform meant for social exchange in front of each residence.  Their white stucco houses marched in two neat rows to flank the dirt path,  fourteen houses in all. These were proud, self-possessed, energetic faces. The  unexpected visitors identified themselves and were soon seated in the midst  of a circle of a dozen old and young men. The American explained that he was  seeking conversation with Veda pandits, particularly ahitagni, those who had  established the three Vedic fires in their homes, and that he had started in  the Amalapuram area but found no one still active. Suddenly the senior and  recognized spokesman for the agrahara, a tall, lanky elder with heavy glasses  on a lean face, pointed across the circle and announced “He is an ahitagni, he  is an ahitagni, and I am an ahitagni” (see Figure P.1). Debate among three ahi tagini and other Veda pandits, Sriramaputam 1987. From left: Baballa, Bulusu  Cayanulu, Duvvuri Yajulu.) An energetic three-hour discussion of Vedic texts  and rituals ensued, leading off three decades of engagement with the residents  of this and nearby agrahara. When a modest rupee honorarium was extended  to the senior ahitagni Baballa, following this initial unanticipated meeting,  he declined with an elegant, unforgettable phrase: “Your interest in Veda is  our daksina (ritual payment)!”This book highlights the essential features of  contemporary Vedic life by allowing ahitagni and other Veda pandits, their  wives, and their children to narrate personal experience. This is important  because their communities and their individual narrations, all noteworthy and

remarkable, are largely unknown to mainstream India. Certainly they are far  removed from Western perception. Outside of the subcontinent the general  reader of books about India rarely notices the Vedic tradition, and normally  considers it a strange and remote period that seems to have ended thousands  of years ago. This study explores a valuable living tradition. 

The four generations of ten families in this book represent a period of  rapid and far-reaching changes. Although they share textual and ritual bases,  no two pandits have had the same experience. Despite their relatively uniform  training in Veda there is no Vedic template to embrace them all. Any merit in  this survey may lie in the revelation of a great variety of personalities, experi 

ences, and attitudes. 

The visitors on that October day in 1980 were the author of this book  and his younger colleague, M.  V. Krishnayya, who shares in its dedication  and could truthfully be regarded as mediating Telugu pandit and diplomat,  one whose charm, energy, and easy humor in conversation elicited candid  and earnest response from men, women, and children of all strata of village  and urban coastal Andhra society. Born and raised in East Godavari District,  his Telugu dialect and training in Indian philosophy afforded direct access  that made this work possible. The pair returned to Sriramapuram and other  

Preface xvii 

agrahara, villages, and towns of the delta over the years to record the voices  of these exceptional people. In Sriramapuram the pair was sometimes teased,  erasing distinctions of color and culture, as “Rama and Krishna paying a visit.”  The book is about the reciters and sacrificers, their wives and families, their  crucial links to a 3,700-year-old tradition that India regards as its founda 

tional culture. It is their voices that should be heard. Although it may appear  unusual to skirt their use, first-person pronouns seem intrusive in the distin guished company of these Godavari voices. At times for clarity of context the  commonly used Telugu word dora, Foreigner or Westerner, is a third-person  reference to the author. 

Field interviews, well over a hundred in all, frequently lasting for three  hours, were recorded, transcribed, edited into field notes, and later entered into  computer documents. On some occasions the author was the sole interviewer  and at other times Professor Krishnayya, Emeritus Chair of the Philosophy  Department of Andhra University in Visakhapatnam, undertook interviews  in Rajahmundry, Annavaram, Simhacalam, and Vijayawada when the author  was not in India. Lakshmi Narasamamba, PhD, was another invaluable assis 

tant, particularly in her role of entering residential interiors to converse with  women. When e-mail came into vogue in the late 1990s it was the youthful  Duvvuri Sita Ram Sastry who supplied updated information as well as inter view assistance in 2005. A number of other research associates and assistants  graciously gave their time and energy, and they are remarked by name in the  Acknowledgments. 

One of the obstacles for the general reader of articles and books on Vedic  studies is the formidable array of technical terms. At the end of the book there  is a substantial Glossary of Sanskrit and Telugu words with proper diacriti cal marks. A few dozen terms, all Sanskrit, could be considered essential for  a basic understanding of the flow of Vedic tradition, including the texts and  rituals of contemporary Veda pandits in coastal Andhra. These are briefly dis cussed in Chapter 2, a chapter that might serve as a resource when they recur.  All terms in italics are Sanskrit unless noted as Telugu or another language. 

Chapter 1 introduces the reader to the Godavari Delta, an area that has  received scant attention in studies of the subcontinent, with details on the  geographic and historic character of this beautiful, mobile triangle of many  rivers and streams, a region much prized for its productivity and therefore a  locus—even in the modern era—of constant political contention. Figures 0.1  through 0.6 are scenes in or close to Konasima. Interlined with history are  sketched-in references to the mythic, ritual, and symbolic backdrop of a Vedic  presence in the delta, leading into Chapter 2 that opens up the meaning of a  life lived “in the Veda.” This chapter, with presentations of both textual and 

xviii Preface 

ritual progression, is essentially an introduction to Vedic tradition as it is  expressed in coastal Andhra, one of the two or three dominant Vedic areas  of India and the last to perform both soma and animal sacrifices in authentic  fashion. 

Chapter 3 is a selection of capsule biographies of more than a score of  pandits and fire sacrificers in ten families. These families, stretching now  over four generations, illustrate the diversity of Vedic careers as well as  their remarkable achievements. The next four chapters return to a more  detailed examination of the Vedic life in progress outlined in Chapter 2,  beginning with Chapter 4 and the young student’s learning of the Taittiriya  Samhita from his father, grandfather, or older brother. Marriage and even 

tual residence with a wife lead to the householder stage of life, the subject  of Chapter 5. Women’s lives, children and life-cycle rituals, the means of  livelihood, and an inevitable final passage into retirement, death, and the  beyond are further topics here. 

Chapter 6 reviews the ritual life introduced in Chapter 2 and sketches  in a more nuanced portrait of an ahitagni and his wife, routine daily, fort nightly, and annual offerings in their three-fire household, the initiatory  soma and animal sacrifice, further great sacrifices, and the special funerals  required for soma sacrificers and their wives. In conclusion, the Epilogue  following Chapter 6 sums up the modern experience of ahitagni and other  Veda pandits and the marked cultural, economic, educational, and other  changes from the times of those fathers and grandfathers selected for biog raphies in Chapter 3.

### Notes

Chapter 1

1. “The Dry Salvages.”

2. The crocodile is an enduring symbol. Asko Parpola makes the case for the  crocodile cult of the Indus civilization still existing among Gujarati tribals four  thousand years later (2012c, 2012b: 9).

3. Kashikar and Parpola (in Staal 1983.2: 204–5) provide evidence, chiefly from  Epigraphica indica, of other Vedic rituals documented from inscriptions discov ered in Andhra.

4. Thapar 1966–67 1: 173 with reference to Pallavas, Calukyas, and Rastrakutas;  Kulke and Rothermund 2010: 74.

5. Talbot 2001: 22. There is considerable elasticity in historical references to  “Vengi,” variously indicating the village-becoming-a-town near Eluru midway  between the Krishna and Godavari deltas, or the capital of the Eastern Calukas  that formerly was situated at Pithapuram, or the entire coastal zone between  the great deltas; cf. Mangalam 1980: 106–7 with maps and Gopalachari 1976.  A series of chieftains bearing the name Sankayana, possibly related to a Vedic  lineage, ruled from Vengi for about a hundred years until they were displaced  by Visnukundins early in the fifth century.

14. The lingering effects of endemic filarial worms, smallpox, and malaria, all  thought to be goddess-produced, gave an uncanny atmosphere to the town in  1980: scores of temple priests and other residents dragged grotesque elephan tiasis feet about the lanes.

15. Richard Eaton (2005) tracks the career of this exceptional sovereign as the first  of eight lives he artfully employs to portray the vicissitudes of Deccan culture  and politics from the fourteenth through the eighteenth centuries. And Cynthia  Talbot (2000) explores a text composed c. 1490–1550 she regards as the first  Telugu historiography, the Pratiparudra Caritamu, the Story of Pratipa Rudra,  with a version of Kakatiya dynastic events that varies considerably from that of  Indo-Muslim historians.

16. Satyanarayana 1975–83: 2, 94–5. A thorough and convincing study by Richard  Eaton (2000) of temple desecration during the Indo-Muslim period of 1192– 1728 does not mention in his list of eighty destroyed temples the replace ment of the Rajahmundry temple of Venugopal by a mosque under the reign  of Muhammad Tughluq. Sounding a note of caution regarding the view in  Indo-Muslim accounts (as well as later Hindu nationalist perspectives) of con stant Muslim destruction of temples, he builds a case for Indo-Muslim support  and protection of Hindu temples once a region had been subjugated. His argu ment is that temples were political institutions with shared sovereignty of a  king and the deity within a royal temple. Since resident deities were closely con nected to ruling authorities, Hindu as well as Muslim warring kings removed  temple images in order to defuse or co-opt their powers.

32. When the American researcher first heard this common expression he was  shocked: Huns were the dreaded Germans of his childhood, barbarians whose  lust for empire started both World Wars. In India, however, the Huns are not  limited to invaders of the Punjab in the fifth century ce but also include British  aggressors who established a universal system of education that—in the eyes  of traditional Veda pandits—was incompatible with Vedic learning.

39. As will be noted in Chapter 3, several Veda pandits rented out portions or all  of their crop fields as “gentleman farmers,” with actual farmers honoring oral  agreements and paying in produce. Writing of earlier centuries, David Ludden  credits coastal Andhra village elders who supervised rental transactions in oral  contracts linked to market prices (1999: 178).

280 Notes

Chapter 2

1. Srauta, based on sruti, “that which is heard,” i.e., the Veda, is not easily distin guished as a ritual category. Jan Gonda and other scholars have defined srauta rituals as “solemn” or “public” but neither term is satisfactory. More accurate  in both time and space, “extended” describes this complex schedule of rites  advanced beyond the grhya domestic program.

2. These portions are known in Telugu as panna and in Sanskrit as prasna, liter ally “questions” or “lessons.” Chapter 4 expands further on the student’s Vedic  textual absorption.

3. This is not to suggest that Vedic Brahmans alone are capable of prodigious  feats of memory. Before immigrating to Wisconsin from Scotland at the age  of eleven, John Muir, the naturalist of Rocky Mountain fame, had memorized  the entire New Testament and nearly half the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament),  having been beaten into compliance by his father. Numerous Muslims memo

rize the entire Qur’an, Jaina monks often have phenomenal memories, and  adherents of other faiths as well as secular folk such as numerologists are fur ther examples. In 2013, a student from an Indian immigrant family was the  American national champion speller, a thirteen-year-old Telugu speaker in sev enth grade, Arvind Mahankali, who placed third in the contest in 2010 and 2011  (New York Times June 1, 2013, p. A1).

4. The upanayana is detailed in Chapter 4.

5. The ritual of marriage, vivaha, is described in Chapter 5 covering the lives of  householders.

6. Kane rejects Ram Gopal’s arguments for a North Indian home for Apastamba  and suggests the school may have originated in “Andhra and the territory about  the mouth of the Godavari” (Kane 1968–75, 1.1:67; cf. Gopal 1983a: 94–98).  Textual scholars date the ApSS to c. 500 bce, the ApGS to perhaps two centuries  later, and a third Apastamba Sutra, the Dharma Sutra, to c. 300 bce. To be kept  in mind is the vast span of centuries between assembly of the hymns of the RV  in the period c. 1750–1500 bce and the application of mantras and chants in the  Brahmana-texts and Sutras.

7. This offering is sthali-pakana, the cooking of rice in a pot (sthali) as an isti per formed every new-and-full moon day. Tachikawa and Kolhatkar 2006 provide  an excellent portrayal of every step of the sthali-paka with 110 photos of per formances by Ganeshashastri Shende (1899–1992) in Maharashtra according  to AsvGS. There is also a brief introduction and text and translation of a ritual  manual including mantras from the RV and injunctions from the TB and both  Asvalayana Sutras.

8. On the Sama Veda, D.  Arkasomayaji, at the TTD office in Tirupati noted  November 13, 1980: “I have heard Sama Veda recitations in Konasima and they  are unlike the other three, Jaiminiya, Kauthuma, and Ranayaniya. Konasima

Notes 281

has preserved one of the many other ancient sakha.” On the other hand, Western  scholars, including Parpola and Heesterman, perceive only two recensions,  Jaiminiya and Kauthuma-Ranayaniya, the latter pair approximately identical.  Howard (1977) observes distinctions between Kauthuma and Ranayaniya and  notes that the “Kauthuma” of Tamil Nadu is actually Ranayaniya. Cf. Renou  1947: 85–129. It is not surprising that disagreements persist since there are  thousands of ganas and musical notations are variable. Further field recording  and study is clearly warranted.

9. Staal 1983: 1: 45f; 2: 201–55.

10. This triadic classification is not in the Vedas although, as Frederick Smith  (1987: 122–224) explains it, TS 2:1–4 essentially makes such a separation. 11. The patni (wife) does not drink soma in the ritual but obtains it by eating the  leftovers of her husband’s food. After her death and cremation a “re-burning”  or secondary cremation is required to remove traces of soma from her bones.  Chapter 6 provides further details on this important circumstance. 12. Staal 1983; the 40-minute film Altar of Fire was produced by Frits Staal and directed  by Robert Gardner, Berkeley: University of California Media Center, 1977. 13. The daksina that should go to each priest as a share of the sacrifice, are notori ously open-ended, often extravagant. Dividing up a thousand cows is a recurrent  notation. ApSS 13.5.1–13 is an example of variability, including the sacrificer’s  entire estate with an exception of an inheritance share for the first son. On one  hand is a demonstrative potlatch enterprise. On the other hand is the intrigu ing directive to the sacrificer (13.6.6) to divide body and soul as daksina, his  mind to the brahman, breath to the adhvaryu, eye to the udgatr, even his atman to the sadasya, seventeenth priest, a remarkable presentation to this minor but  symbolically significant actor, the number seventeen being that of Prajapati,  lord of sacrifice.

14. This “plus one” formula is discussed in Knipe 1975:1–18 and 1991:40–42.  Abstract numbers occur in many contexts as, for example, the “totality” of six teen surmounted by Prajapati as seventeen, discussed by Gonda 1984 index. Cf.  also Proferes 2007: 23–76, “Ritual fires and the construction of sovereignty.” 15. Fuller 1992: 57.

16. Among elements evoking intense human responses, fire has a special place in  the history of religions. See Knipe 2004b and 1975: 45–89; Bachelard 1964a;  Heesterman, 1983, 1993: 86–141; Falk 2002; Patton 2005: 104–111.

17. On the Zoroastrian cult of fire in ancient Iran, see Boyce 1986, 1975, 1979.  On soma see Jan Houben 2003 with a substantial bibliography; Parpola 1995,  2012a: 247–51; the botanist Harri Nyberg 1995; Falk 1989; Staal 1983 1: 105– 13; McClymond 2008: 101–11. On expansion of the BMAC (Bactria Margiana  Archaeological Complex) see Chapter 1 this volume and Parpola 2002a, 2012a;  on the post-Vedic history of the soma plant see the essay by Wendy Doniger

282 Notes

O’Flaherty in Wasson 1968: 95–147; on the background of the soma-theft myth,  Knipe 1967.

18. An obsession with the dangerous impurity (asauca, asuddha) and inauspicious ness of menstrual blood seems strange to the contemporary West until one  looks into some bizarre attitudes and concepts of nineteenth-century Europe  and America. For the affluent, paper-rich West, “feminine napkins” have been  available to women for over a century, the even more discreet mini-tampons  being a more recent innovation. No banishment from kitchen or dining areas  and, with electric washing machines a standard household item, no embar rassing garment stains in the laundry. But for occasional guarded TV ads, the  monthly change for perhaps a third of the population goes without remark by  male Western culture. India, with an entire “unclean” caste of men and women  laboring in rivers and streams to wash clothes, takes a closer look at this female  “disease” as if it were dangerously infectious and, ritually speaking, it is tradi tionally considered to be exactly that.

19. This bodily assumption of sacred fires is described at the close of TS 3.4.10  with reference to the sacrificer as the birthplace of Agni and therefore a proper  temporary container outside of the hearths. The term atma-rohana is not  accepted by some Konasima authorities although ApSS.6.28.10-11 describes  the procedure of bodily assumption immediately after transfer into arani. On  the wood for arani, asvattha grown on a sami tree, see ApSS 5.1.2. Frederick  Smith 1987: 92–96 details the techniques of both churning and consignment  of fire; cf. Heesterman 1993: 94ff.

20. Frederick Smith 1987: 49 and n.168 describes the 1977 paundarika sacrifice.  A  similar event occurred in coastal Andhra during a neighborhood festival  when the featured goddess’s ritual pole suddenly fell to the ground. In the  ensuing pandemonium a German scholar-observer seen running for cover was  blamed for carrying off the goddess in his beard.

Chapter 3

1. Further details on wives, marriage, children, and the householder’s life are dis cussed in Chapter 5.

2. More details on antyesti, the offering of the body, sraddha, ancestor rituals, and  afterlife are discussed in Chapter 6.

3. The musi-vayanam is detailed in Chapter 5. For an extensive discussion of this  special coastal Andhra funeral with a female Brahman ritualist, see Knipe 2003. 4. Avadhani or Avadhanulu is an honorific (from Sanskrit avadhana, “attention,  attentiveness”) signaling special ability to remember important matters, in this  case, Veda. It is commonly affixed to Veda pandit names of those who have  achieved the status of krama-pathi.

Notes 283

5. Manu 5.167–68 allows for remarriage and rekindling of fire; cf. Kane 1968–75,  4: 225.

6. A  correction to the 1997 essay, “Becoming a Veda in the Godavari Delta” is  acknowledged here: whereas both of his sons became ghana-pathi Samavedam  senior did not achieve that rank.

7. Cf. Stephanie Jamison’s remarks on hospitality 1996:182–84. 8. The quiet, virtually anonymous presence in Kakinada, the bustling headquar ters of East Godavari District, of an ahitagni well known among Vedic Brahmans  across South India was revealed by M.  V. Krishnayya to the vice chancellor  of Jawaharlal Nehru Technical University in Kakinada, Professor Alam Appa  Rao. The vice chancellor published his sumptuously illustrated book Kakinada. The Making of a University City (Hyderabad: Geographica 2010) with biographi cal details on the educational, political, and cultural lights of the area with no  mention of Mitranarayana or his famous predecessor, now deceased, Uppuluri  Ganapati Sastri. Amends were made late in 2010 with a videotaped celebratory  meeting and portrait photography of Mitranarayana and his wife Anasuya. 9. See Chapter 2, n. 8.

10. Only Bulusu Kamesvara’s wife Satyavati was comparable. It is most probable  that Venkatesvara’ late wife, Sita Rama Laksmi, was equally well informed; less  research time, however, was spent in Simhacalam than in Annavaram. Other  patni might have contributed had they been allowed to speak freely, particu

larly in the early 1980s when their srauta lives were still fresh in mind. Laksmi  Narasamamba was able to interview Anasuya, Lanka’s wife, privately in the  house, in 1991. Otherwise, on the rare occasion when she was present, Lanka  would always answer questions directed to her. Widows (Sundari, Anasuya,  Subbalaksmi, others) were always open and forthcoming.

11. See Knipe 2004a on “ritual subversion.”

12. Being familiar with Indian books and the many creatures who dine on them,  these elders would appreciate a comment by Frits Staal: “Books bound in India  continue to fall apart but the Vedic Oral Tradition is still there” (2008: 252).

Chapter 4

1. On the Vedic textual tradition in general see Gonda 1975; Witzel 1987, 1997b;  Parpola 1997, 2002b: 44–48; Patton 1994a, 1994b, 2004a; Holdrege 1994a,  1994b.

2. Bachelard 1964a, 1964b, 1969. This is also in illo tempore, “in that time,”  the “great” time (Eliade 1959:  80–113) when cosmically foundational events  occurred, an age newly recovered and entered by living believers. By intu iting Veda the great rsis established both sacred text and ritual; those today  who “enter” Veda live in that time writ large and even speak of themselves as

284 Notes

legatees of rsis whose names they recite twice daily and are believed to watch  over them.

3. Staal 1989: 48.

4. On the upanayana and career of the brahmacarin, see Kane 1968–74, 2.1: 268– 415; Brian Smith 1989: 92–101; Pandey 1969:111–40.

5. Pandits insist on Vedic oral transmission ab origine. It has been put forth  that limited early writing of a Veda may have occurred, for example, in the  pada-patha legacy; see Bronkhorst 1982; contra Falk 1993. On “orality and  memory culture” and an aversion to written transmission of sacred texts see  the important essay by Houben and Rath 2012.

6. On dating Vedic texts see n.1 above; Olivelle 1996: xxxvi–xxxvii on the Upanisads;  Gonda 1977 and Lingat 1973: 20–23 on Apastamba’s Sutras.

9. On sama-vartana see further Heesterman 1968; Kane 1968–75, 2.1: 405–15;  Pandey 1969: 146–52.

10. This Andhra specialty has afforded more than one pandit mentioned in this  survey with nearly a fulltime career.

11. On sakha see Gonda 1975; Witzel 1987, 1997b; Renou 1947; Patton 2005: 31–36. 12. Of 401 names in one catalogue of Veda pandits in Andhra (Jeeyar 1976) only  nine are listed as Rg Vedins with Asvalayana Sutra.

13. Jeeyar 1976 has only a single pandit listed for Andhra: “Kauthuma sakha, Sama  Veda, Drahyayana Sutra.” Three are given as “Ranayaniya sakha, Sama Veda,”  but with Asvalayana Sutra; possibly they acquired the Sama Veda after the Rg  Veda.

14. Jeeyar 1976 lists ten Sukla Yajur Veda pandits for Andhra, all with Katyayana  as Sutra, three of them in Madhyandina sakha, seven in Kanva sakha. Of the  Kanvas three are in Kothapeta, East Godavari District.

15. A different tale accounting for this epithet came from another Taittiriya pandit:  “Madhyandina students once challenged their guru and in anger he recipro cated ‘You Candalas!’ The curse of a guru cannot be reversed, only ameliorated.  They pleaded for mercy and the guru relented. So exactly at noon for half an  hour they are Untouchable Candalas. So they are excluded, have no right to eat  with others due to caste pollution. We may not even talk to them! They have to  keep to themselves!”

16. On the Vidhana texts for various samhita and the use of vidhi see Patton 2005:  27–34.

17. Still in use today in the Delta is another term for an assembly of learned  Brahmans, parisad, one found in the earliest Upanisads. Cf. Olivelle 1993: 210  where he cites ApDhS 1.3.11.38.

1. The Cloudsplitter (New York: HarperCollins 1998), 37.

2. Sanskrit masa, moon, month; masika, monthly; cf. English menses, from Latin  mensis, month, Greek men, month, mene, moon.

3. That is to say, she disappears to the rear of the house. Velcheru Narayana Rao  (1994: 128) precisely describes the Andhra Brahman house with its division  into three areas, men in the front, women in back including the kitchen and  the backyard with a well where women gather and servants enter. In between  is a neutral zone where genders meet, the men entering discreetly by cough

ing or summoning a female to signal intended arrival. Cf. Marjatta Parpola  (2000: 142–43) on Naputiri “ownership of territory and privacy.” Regarding the period of impurity and seclusion, Holly Reynolds (1978: 100– 113) reports on Madurai District, Tamil Nadu (including certain influence from  Telugu Brahmans) that it is three to seven days, the first three being maximum  pollution; also on Tami Nadu, Gabriella Eichinger Fero-Luzzi (1974); on the  Namputiris in Kerala, M. Parpola (2000: 181). On an eighteenth-century ritual  manual, Julia Leslie (1989: 283–87). Frederique Apffel-Marglin (1985: 56f, 72f,  234f) gives details from Puri, Orissa, where the female period is four days,  including that of the goddess earth who menstruates once a year on Raja  Sankranti in Jyestha, the hot season of May–June; during those four days no  farmer may plow or use a cart and there must be no human sexual intercourse.  Regarding lunar symbolism it might be observed that after its absence the  moon is reborn on the fourth night.

4. ApSS 9.2.1-3. In Konasima this has been reported but not observed. 5. Knipe 1997 and 2003.

6. Cf. Kane (1968–75 2.1: 518 and n. 1208) citing the exact same ApDhS pas sage quoted from memory by Lanka. Trikandamandana 1.80c-81b, permit ting the wife whose husband is away to perform agni-hotra with the aid of  another, is cited by Frederick Smith (1987:  164f.). According to Konasima  pandits the replacement could be, for example, a qualified son or nephew.  Recent scholarly studies have illuminated the role of the patni. Stephanie  Jamison (1996:  289 n.295, 292 n.20) translates a mantra from Maitrayani  Samhita 1.4.3 addressed to the husband and wife during an isti: “You two  have become the yoked team of the worship.” Ellison Banks Findly mar shals texts highlighting “the naturalness of the marital unit” in Vedic ritu als (2002: 21) and Mary McGee (2002) convincingly summarizes the wife’s  adhikara to perform srauta rituals. Cf. also Leslie (1989: 102ff, 176ff.); H.-P.  Schmidt (1987).

9. Puberty rituals among Aiyar Brahmans in Kanyakumari District, Tami Nadu,  are well described with case studies in Vasumathi Duvvury (1991: 111–32); she  distinguishes between vaidika and laukika traditions and employs the methodol ogy of van Gennep to understand puberty as separation, marriage as transition,  childbearing as incorporation into the community of auspicious married women  (su-mangali). From her perspective a female is not “fully auspicious” (Tamil  naranja su-mangali) until she attains menopause and sees all her children mar ried and settled (215f). On puberty and first menstruation among Namputiri in  Kerala, M. Parpola (2000: 180–89). Cf. also N. N. Bhattacharyya 1980.

10. Further details on marriage rituals may be found in Kane (1968–75 2.1: 427– 541); R. B. Pandey (1969: 153–233); M. Parpola’s 2000 study of a Namputiri  family in Panjal, Kerala, is the most thorough ethnography of a living Vedic  community yet published; marriage and the lives of married women are cov ered on pp.  191–209; Duvvury (1991:  132–83); Ram Gopal (1983:  204–54);  R.  S. Khare (1976:  189–240); Baidyanath Sarasvati (1977:  114–205); Padfield  (1908:  94–118), covering Brahman and other marriages in Telugu-speaking  areas at the close of the nineteenth century.

11. Patrick Olivelle (1993:  45–53) discusses another version of this triple debt,  Satapatha Brahmana 1.7.2.1–6, one that also treats rna payments as avadana.  Analyzing a “theology of debts,” citing Charles Malamoud (1980:  41–43, tr.  1996) and others, he notes that rna can mean a fault, crime, or guilt as well as  debt. The association of debt and guilt in this context may have origins in the  Rg Veda. On the wider context of debt see Donald Davis (2010).

12. On the ritual and theoretical details of these ten-day parallels see Knipe (2007)  in German and the original English version, “Constructing a provisional body  for the preta in Hindu funerals,” delivered at Heidelberg University, 2004, in  Knipe (forthcoming); also Knipe (2007: 184–86).

13. On samskara in general prior to death rites see Kane (1968–75:  2.1:  188– 582); Pandey (1969); McGee (2004); Gavin Flood (1994); Lakshmi Kapani  (1992: 1: 81–165); Sarasvati (1977: 82–113); Nicholas and Inden (1977: 35–66)  on Bengali rites; Knipe (1991: 120–28). Gonda (1956) is a model study of the  simantonnayana. Death and the final samskara are pursued at the close of this  chapter and again in Chapter 6 concerning special rites for ahitagni.

16. United Nations World Population Prospects for 2005–2010, 2006, Table  A.17, provided statistics for India in the period of the last ahitagni deaths in

Notes 287

Konasima: an average longevity of 66.4 years for women, 63.2 years for men.  India was then ranked 139 of 195 nations. Modern medicine, a better diet, and  proliferation of hospitals and clinics have sharply increased longevity; between  1980 and 2000 there was an astonishing 90 percent increase in the number of  people in India who lived beyond 70.

17. Olivelle (1993: 161–82) makes clear the distinction between an early system of  career choice of one asrama from among the four and a “classical” system that  replaced it, with an individual moving sequentially through each one, student,  householder, forest dweller, renouncer. In the classical system, reduplication in  the last two, both of them meaning abandonment of house and village, essen

tially eliminated the forest dweller stage of life, one that is seldom mentioned  by Konasima pandits.

18. ApDhS 2.9.21–23 details rules for the samnyasin with no fire and the forest  hermit with one fire, both of them homeless wanderers begging for food. 19. Agehananda Bharati, an experienced renouncer-scholar, offers his own assess ment (1961: 161f.); cf. Ghurye (1964: 220–37).

25. Kane (1968–75 2.1: 583–93) discusses texts regarding widows; cf. M. Parpola  (2000: 239–40); Julia Leslie (1989: 298–30); Vanaja Dhruvarajan (1989: 91–95).  Regarding the Tamil Aiyar Brahman widow, Duvvury (1991:  224–27) details  the pre-dawn stripping of the marriage thread on the eleventh day after her  husband’s death rather than the day of his cremation.

26. On details and case studies of the musi-vayanam: Knipe (2003). The report from  Tamil Nadu (Duvvury 1991:  226–27) concerns the funeral for an auspicious  Aiyar Brahman wife who dies before her husband, is dressed like a bride in  a bright colored sari, covered with flowers, and considered to be Mahalaksmi.  However, unlike the Godavari rite in which the deceased is sent to Gauri’s  heaven, the Aiyar rite described by Duvvury has no Brahman funerary priest

ess possessed by the spirit of the deceased and no presentations from natal and  marital female relatives who are the only attendees.

Michael Witzel 2000; cf. 1987, 1997a; James Mallory 1989. Other secondary  sources for the general study of Vedic ritual are plentiful; monographs on spe cific rituals are cited in notes below as each is discussed. The Srautakosa (SKE  and SKS for English and Sanskrit sections, respectively) ed. by C. G. Kashikar  and R. N. Dandekar was published in two “volumes,” 1958–95, each with mul tiple “parts,” for a total of eight books. The third and fourth projected volumes  did not appear. Kane’s History of Dharmasastra (1968–75) provides encyclopedic  coverage in five volumes, some also with two parts. Ranade 2006 has expanded  Sen 1978 and Renou 1947 with indispensable photos, line drawings, and tex tual citations. Among older general works that remain insightful resources  are Hillebrandt 1897; Bergaigne 1878–83; Levi 1898; Hubert and Mauss 1898  (Eng. tr. 1964); Oldenberg 1923; Keith 1925; Dumont 1927, 1939; Rodhe 1946.  More recent general studies include Potdar 1953; Renou 1954; Gonda 1965a,  1977, 1980; Kashikar 1968; Thite 1975; Knipe 1975; Malamoud 1976; Moody  1980; Krick 1982; Gopal 1983; Staal 1983; F. M. Smith 1987; B. K. Smith  1989; Sparreboom and Heesterman 1989; Patton 1994a, 1994b, 2004a, 2005;

Minkowski 1991; Oberlies 1998–99; Staal 2008; McClymond 2008. 2. 4.14.2a, Patrick Olivelle’s translation 1996: 134, emphasis added. 3. Bachelard 1964a: 7. Agni has been described by Jan Heesterman as the sacrifi cer’s “external soul” (1987: 223), his “alter ego” (1993: 27, 29).

4. On the implements used in grhya and srauta rites see the excellent photographs  and descriptions in Yajnayudhani, the Vaidika Samsodhana Mandala publica tion edited by T. N. Dharmadhikari in 1989; also Ranade 2006, an alphabetic  list by Sanskrit name; Tachikawa et  al. 2001:  41–47 and many photos; Sen  1978: 171–75; Ranade 1978 with photos and sketches following p. 447.

5. On the naksatra and adhana see the detailed analysis of Hertha Krick 1982: 9–38.  The naksatra are discussed further in segment 4 of this chapter. 6. No animal is sacrificed in the adhana, but present are both a yoked white horse  and a cart or “chariot” wheel that is rolled from the garha-patya to the ahavaniya as embers are transferred. Jan Heesterman sees vestiges of a more ancient pro gram in which Agni was transported by chariot, perhaps indicating “a warlike  expedition, especially when the accompanying mantras (referring to unnamed  enemies) are taken into consideration” (1987: 232); cf. Sparreboom 1985: 65ff.;  Krick 1982. As shown later, chariots play significant roles in several major sac rifices; cf. also Parpola 2005; 2012a: 249–50: Anthony 2007.

7. On the bondage of mutual hatred between sacrificers consider TS 1.1.9.8;  1.3.1.3; 1.5.7.6; 2.5.11.7; 2.6.4.2–4; etc.; cf. AV 10.6.1–35. ApSS 22.13 pre scribes the performance of the vighnana (hammer) sacrifice to kill an enemy  and elsewhere Apastamba provides numerous methods of using sorcery (abhi cara) against rival sacrificers as well as defensive techniques (cf. ApSS 2.20.1;  3.14.1–3). In The Broken World of Sacrifice Jan Heesterman observes, regarding

Notes 289

ancient sacrifice, it is “from beginning to end a conflict.” Competition among  sacrificers, he notes, reflects the continuing redistribution of material goods  necessary for life (1993: 33–41). On ritual rivalry, known by the Delta pandits as  srauta-kaksa, the naming of enemies, and a comparative study of Vedic sacrifi

cers and non-Brahman possession ritualists in the Godavari Delta, see Knipe,  “Ritual subversion . . .” 2004a. Cf. B. K. Smith 1996.

8. On the adhana (also known as agnya-dhana or agnya-dheya) see Krick 1982;  Sparreboom and Heesterman 1989; Moody 1980; Kane 1968–75: 2.2: 986–97;  Hillebrandt 1897: 105–6; Keith 1925: 316–18; SKE 1.1: 1–84; on punar-adheya Krick 1982: 314ff; Hillebrandt 1897: 109; Kane 1968–75: 2.2: 997–98. Theodore  Proferes (2007: 62–75) explores connections between the five peoples or tribes  of the RV and other texts and the five fires, races of humans, and directions  (four cardinal points plus the center).

9. Bodewitz 1976: 3; cf. 34–40, 144–46, 162–64. Bodewitz notes here the identifi cation of sacred fires with breath, prana, both cosmic and human; inhalation  and exhalation owning counterparts in sunrise and sunset.

10. Cited by Asko Parpola (1998: 227) in Bodewitz’s translation (1976: 157). 11. On agni-hotra, in addition to Bodewitz’s three volumes, see Parpola 1998: 227– 28; Brian Smith 1989:  5, 156–57; SKE 1.1:  85–198; Dumont 1927, 1964;  Kane 1968–75: 2.2: 998–1008; Hillebrandt 1897: 109–11; Keith 1925: 318–19;  McClymond 2008: 97–101.

12. The term darsa refers to the first “appearance” of the emerging new moon,  while a fortnight later the moon is purna, “full.” Monographs on these two  istis include Rustagi 1981, with sketches of ritual implements in chapter 10,  and Hillebrandt 1880. Cf. SKE 1.1: 211–501; Keith 1925: 319–21; Kane 1968–

75:  2.2:  1009–90 (including pinda-pitr-yajna); Dumont 1957–61; Jamison  1996:  index; Brereton 2004; Frederick Smith 1987:  478–83. Tachikawa,  Bahulkar, and Kolhatkar (2001) discuss with photos a pavitresti, modified form  of darsa-purna-masa, performed in Pune in 1979.

290 Notes

21. Dumont 1954: 205; this introduces Dumont’s translation of TB 3.1.1–6. 22. Asko Parpola has aptly defined naksatra as “lunar marker stars” (1998: 239) along  with arresting insights on several asterisms including Rohini, marker of the  vernal and autumnal equinoxes, the festival times for Durga. Already in 1985  he had begun to connect Indus Valley seal symbols with Vedic patterns such as  the dhisniya fires, seven sages, and seven stars of Ursa major (1985: 60, 122–40). The Taittiriya ritual use of naksatra is outlined in TB. 3.1.4–6; BSS 28.3–4  including a recommendation that naksatra-isti should be done at least three  times in a life. Secondary sources on naksatra include Kane 1968–75: 5.1: 486– 536; Krick 1982:  3–38; Dumont 1954; SKE 1.1:  591–93. Regarding the nine  planets, nava-graha are discussed in Markel 1989 and Knipe 1995, the latter  with attention to Godavari Delta beliefs and practices among Hindus in gen eral. Several Veda pandits mentioned troublesome grahas; few praised benefi cent ones for their favors.

23. Cf. ApSS 6.30.14. Frederick Smith (1987: 168) notes that this may be done in  the absence of the sacrificer; Konasima pandits treasure this ritual enormously  and would not miss its delights.

24. On the agrayana see Meyer 1937 and the brief overviews of Kane 1968–75: 2.2.  827–29 (grhya), 1106–7 (srauta) and Ram Gopal 1983:  427–29 (grhya), 542  (srauta); Keith 1925:  323–24; Hillebrandt 1897:  119–20; SKE 1.1:  502–15.  Extraordinarily obtuse is Keith’s remark (1925: 2.323): “That [the agrayana] was  felt to be in any way sacramental, or even as inducing a special sense of com

munity, is not to be seen in the Vedic evidence.” The agrayana festival at the  time of Durga-puja is in fact the most cohesive of all ritual times for Veda pan dits and the wider Hindu populace and it is difficult to imagine this was not the  case in the ancient period.

Although Matthew Sayers does not take up the catur-masya rites  he convincingly situates the pinda-yajna and the earlier pinda-pitr-yajna in the  broad context of developing Vedic texts, including the Taittiriya srauta and grhya series (2013: 40–69); cf. D. R. Shastri 1963: 54.

and then the other soma sacrifices in Part  3, pp.  1–200 with appendices on  the sutras following, 201–80. V. G. A. Somayajulu, an industrious scholar at  Andhra University, Vishakhapatnam, completed his PhD thesis in 1991 under  the direction of Professor Akkubhatla Sharma. Somayajulu interviewed all the  ahitagni discussed here and others in Hyderabad as well as Krishna and Guntur  Districts. His thesis, submitted in cursive Sanskrit, remains unpublished, the  author having retired to live in Hyderabad.

38. Before asphyxiation became standard practice decapitation was normative.  Later in this chapter the agni-cayana is described with its foundation sacrifice of  male heads, originally placed in the first layer of the fire altar. A termite mound  turret and a clay replica of a human head now serve as fore-offerings, followed  by asphyxiated goats substituting for the decapitated man, horse, bull, ram, and  goat.

56. Asko Parpola sees the 180-day intervals of the year-long sattra as equinoxes,  turning points of the sun, culminating on the Vivasvat (Sun) day and the  maha-vrata day. He also suggests that the maha-vrata and the asva-medha may  originally have been one ritual (1983: 49, 51).

misses it as “very strange” and probably “make-believe.”

59. The episode of Indra shattered by drinking soma stolen from Tvastr occurs in  TS 2.3.2.5–8. Not familiar to Konasima pandits are the details of VS 19–21 (e.g.,

Notes 293

19.93 where Sarasvati and the Asvins reconstruct Indra) and SB 5.5.4.1; 12.7.1– 9.3.16. Although they are distinctly different in substance and ritual preparation  TB 1.3.3.2 makes a united pair of male soma and female sura, a coincidentia  oppositorum also of light and darkness. Apastamba recommends an extra goat  sacrifice to Brhaspati in case the yajamana has previously vomited soma (ApSS  19.2.2); on the full sautramani see ApSS 19.1–10. Contemporay use of soma-lata appears to pose no threat of stomach illness. When tasted the dora found it to be  a bitter, nasty juice unless laced with honey and one with no psychotropic effect.

60. Sources on the sautramani include Thite 1975: 83–89; Kane 1968–75: 2.2: 1224– 28; Jamison 1991: 98–102; Rönnow 1929; Gopal 1983a: 166–67, 544–45; Keith  1925: 362–54; Dumont 1965; Hillebrandt 1897: 159–61; SKE 1.2: 899–943.

61. Puhvel 1970:  160; O’Flaherty [Doniger] 1980b:  85. Cf. also the exegeses of  myths, symbols, and sexual mystereries behind the asva-medha in O’Flaherty  [Doniger] 1980b: 149–64, 239–41, and passim.

62. Usually these dialogues are labeled by translators “obscene.” Stephanie Jamison  (1996: 73) rightly prefers to call them “sexual riddles” and notes: “We must treat  these riddle dialogues as deeply serious attempts to approach and verbally har vest the mysterious forces released in sexual activity.”

63. Asko Parpola, the leading authority in comparative studies of the Indus Valley  seals and the Vedas, sees the Harappan water-buffalo sacrifice as the origin of  the later Vedic horse sacrifice (2012b: 11; 2004: 483–85, 494–507; cf. Hitebeitel  1978. In addition to asva-medha sources already cited, see Koppers 1936; Kane  1968–75:  2.2:  1228–1239; Puhvel 1955 and 1970; Thite 1975:  89–97; Keith  1925: 343–47; Dumont 1948; Hillebrandt 1897: 149–53; Proferes 2007: 169–71;  cf. also Lincoln 1986: 41–64 on sacrifice.

64. Sources on the purusa-medha include Weber 1864; Keith 1925: 347–48; Dumont  1963; Hillebrandt 1897:  153; Sauve 1970; Thite 1975:  23–28, 143; Parpola  2002b: 11–12.

65. Heesterman 1957: 225; other sources on the raja-suya include Falk 1986 on the  significance of dice games; Kulke 1992, Kane 1968–75: 2.2: 1214–1223; cf. also  Keith 1925: 340–43; Hillebrandt 1897: 141–47.

66. This separation is not complete. For example, ApSS 8.13 contains pinda-pitr-yajna to be done in the saka-medha portion of seasonal rituals. BSS 3.10 and 4.32 include  pinda-pitr-yajna between attention to agni-hotra and agrayana. Nevertheless, both  Apastamba and Baudhayana have separate pitr-medha sutras, the former closely  following that of Bharadvaja. Cf. Gonda 1977: 616–21; Sayers 2013.

67. Analysis of this curious circumstance was presented to the Twelfth World  Sanskrit Conference in Helsinki 2003:  “Somidevamma:  The wife who con sumes soma in the Andhra Vaidika tradition.” This will appear in Knipe, Ritual  and Folklore in the Godavari Delta.

68. On RV 10.16.16 see O’Flaherty [Doniger] 1981: 46 nn. 17–18. There are textual  variants of losta-citi in the pitr-medha sutras containing practices reminiscent

of the maha-vrara and asva-medha, including sexually and socially transgres sive dialogue, musical instruments, singing, dancing, slapping the right thigh,  loosening hair, and fanning (in this case, the urn of bones). No living memory  supplies information regarding coastal Andhra performance of this version.  Kane 1968–75: 4: 251–53 volunteers that the rite was assurance to the deceased  of his wife’s continuing fidelity, a curious observation since the wife agreed to  sleep with a Sudra man for one or more nights. In the context of regenerating  life in bones a better explanation might be the arousal of powers of fertility by  realizing suppressed (and forbidden) desires. Once again it may be that certain  features from the pre-classical era have endured in last rites. Finally, it is always  important to note that women of the household insert numerous non-textual  procedures into rites for the dying and the dead.

## 1 The Godavari Delta 

### 1 Riverine Lifelines 

Human imagination is drawn into reverie by many natural phenomena,  among them fires, cloud patterns, solar and full-lunar appearances and dis appearances, the rhythmic pounding of ocean surf on rocks or a broad sand  beach. There is also fascination in the seasonal changes of a great river. T. S.  Eliot began a poem1 with such in mind: 

I do not know much about gods, but I think that the river 

is a strong brown god. 

With its source near Nasik only fifty miles from the Arabian Sea, the  900-mile-long Godavari River cuts a diagonal course across the Deccan pla teau before it delivers sumptuous brown waters into the Bay of Bengal. At  the beginning point of its delta near Rajahmundry it may in full flood be well  over two miles wide. To appreciate the true character of the Godavari, how ever, it should be studied in all of its seasons. In bursting monsoon depths  it shakes the surrounding earth like the ferocious goddess it is known to be,  great brown folds of water overlapping and tearing away chunks of the levee  that are carried scores of miles to end up on the floor of a delta that has broad ened this way for hundreds of thousands of years. The roar of rushing water  sixty feet deep is as awesome as the sight. Little boys who cannot swim spot  great trees or branches hurtling downstream and hurl themselves with more  guts than foresight from the levee on “Godavari-horse” palm pontoons. They  arm-paddle out wildly, and if they do not drown, intercept and steer potential  firewood to a shore many miles down this monstrous water chute. But the  seasonal rhythm always turns to its opposite, the dry period when a stream  becomes so docile that cows may saunter and cow-paddle from bank to bank6 vedic voices 

where hundreds of new sand islands have appeared. These lanka islands, as  they are called in Telugu, are settled by fishermen who erect mud-and-thatch  dwellings; raise tobacco and vegetable crops; keep chickens, pigs, and goats;  and after sundown light oil lamps that appear from distant levees as a new 

born Milky Way across the silent river. The washing-all-away season will cer tainly follow, but for now, Godavari land is free for the taking. The great river meanders eastward, then southeastward for most of its  journey across the Deccan until it emerges from the rumpled Eastern Hills at  the Papikondulu, the “Sinful Hills,” a curious name for a gorge of breathtak ing beauty and star-rich night skies at the southernmost rim of the Northern  Circar range. Here the river drops south onto the alluvial plain that separates  the Telangana plateau from the sea and in just thirty miles it reaches the apex  tip of the delta. Down at the delta’s base on the Bay of Bengal coast, the spread  of riverine drainage from a tenth of India’s land is nearly a hundred miles.  Atlas cartographers usually illustrate three or four broad streams between  Rajahmundry and the sea. Local perception, however, declares a region of  seven rivers, mythically labeled for the seven rsi, the famed seers who first  intuited the Vedas and whose descendants comprised the seven founding  Vedic lineages, namely, Visvamitra, Jamadagni, Bharadvaja, Gotama, Atri,  Vasistha, and Kasyapa. Few people can name more than a sage or two, but  many tell of encounters with these rsi progenitors who still grace—or haunt— the delta with their presence. Sometimes they are glimpsed briefly in the mist  that rises from the river before dawn, no more remarkable to locals than Irish  folk who claim that a seal now and then emerges from the sea to live among  them as a young woman. Several ahitagni bathe daily in a stream they call  the Kausika, Kusika being another name of the rsi Visvamitra. And it is the  broad Vasistha that separates two zones featured in this study, East and West  Godavari Districts. 

Of course, virtually all the great rivers of India are known as goddesses  and the Godavari is no exception. Goddess Godavari stands aboard a makara,  a crocodile-like raft, looking watchfully down from the walled levee at  Rajahmundry, as if on guard against her own excesses. Until the 1970s there  were indeed crocodiles in this part of the river.2 She is conflated not only with  goddesses Gautami and Ganga (as the south Indian “extension” of the north  Indian Ganges) but also Veda Mata, Mother of the Vedas. Either way, seven  male sages on one hand, or the feminized collection of their insight on the  other, the great river calls attention to the Vedic mystique. 

At the heart of the delta, a sort of cockeyed triangle within a triangle, is  Konasima, a prize canal-rich zone bracketed by the Vainateya and Gautami  branches of the Godavari, blessed with some forty-five inches of annual 

The Godavari Delta 7 

rainfall. Vengi, a historic name for the fertile stretch of Andhra coast between  the Godavari and Krishna deltas, drew the earliest settlements to southeast  India, and Konasima became the nucleus of the northerly delta. This is the  setting of this book, a lush area, a million irrigated acres of broad wetland  rice paddies and coconut palms, the two major crops, as well as sugarcane  and betel on irrigated tracts and on dry land cotton, peanuts, pulses, sesame,  tobacco, mango, citrus, cashew, jackfruit, areca, and banana groves laced with  turmeric, tapioca, betel vines, chili peppers, and other managed plants. 

Its reputation is the zone where everything grows plentifully, luxuriously,  a cornucopia, and for folks coming from crowded urban lanes it is an arama,  a pleasure garden. Today the roadways are lined with nursery displays selling  flowers, shrubs, trees, and planters to visiting townsfolk, more and more of  them in the private cars of the new millennium’s affluent middle class. Paddy  fields, with two or even three crops a year, are always visible and rice is anna,  “food.” If one has not eaten rice in each meal one has not eaten. Carefully  guarded and numbered coconut palms, with a nut-producing life of seventy to  eighty years, grow fifty to an acre and every farmer cultivates them for a steady  income from meat, milk, oil, and husks beaten into coir or used for fuel. “A  coconut tree is more reliable than a son,” is a familiar Telugu proverb. 

### 2 A Historical Overview of the Delta 

#### 1 Early Centuries 

Due to the constant self-landscaping of the two rivers archeologists obtain  few results from combing within the Godavari or Krishna deltas. Inland  well west of the deltas, great ash mounds of burnt cow dung reveal tempo rary settlements of Neolithic cattle herders. Also dotted through the interior  are numerous megalithic tombs. It is estimated that Telugu developed as a  discrete Dravidian spoken language in Andhra early in the first millennium  bce. No historical records have been found, however, earlier than Sanskrit and  Prakrit inscriptions of the second century bce, and inscriptions in Telugu do  not occur for another half millennium or more. 

The first great empire in India after the Harappan Indus civilization was  the Mauryan dynasty in the northern kingdom of Magadha with a capital  in Patailaputra, modern Patna in Bihar. In 324 bce Candragupta Maurya’s  armies began consolidation of the Gangetic plain. His successor Bindusara  penetrated the Deccan and ventured onto parts of the east coast as well. Asoka,  third and best known of the Mauryan rulers, added to the empire Kalinga on  the Bay of Bengal and for a time may have controlled both the Godavari and 

8 vedic voices 

Krishna deltas. During his reign 273–32 bce Asoka left rock-cut edicts in a  Prakrit language carved mostly in Kharosthi and Brahmi scripts, the earliest  in India after the Indus script of c. 2600–1900 bce. Two edicts are north of  the deltas on the coast of Kalinga. According to tradition, Candragupta Maurya  converted to the Jaina faith and committed samlekhana, the fast to death, in  Sravana Belgola on the west coast. Asoka, from the tenor of his edicts and  late-life practice, evidently had strong Buddhist sympathies. 

Both religions were already established in the south, adding Pali as well as  Prakrit to the language mix. Sometime after 200 bce, as in other parts of India,  a stupa, a great mound embodying relics of the Buddha, was constructed at  Amaravati on the Krishna River, upstream from modern Vijayawada. Another  was built later at Nagarjuna-konda, where the Dindi River enters the Krishna,  with caitya halls for assembly and multi-celled monastic quarters (vihara).  A rock-carved caitya, a stupa, and some sixty monastic caves at Guntapalli date  to the second century bce. A number of deteriorating Buddhist monuments  still exist on the Krishna River at Jaggayyapeta and Bhattiprolu as well as other  sites eastward toward the Godavari. Some Saiva temples, in Amaravati and  Draksarama, for example, contain Siva linga that appear to be salvaged from  the ruins of ancient Buddhist marble columns. 

A number of Andhra inscriptions commemorate Vedic sacrifices, includ ing two royal ones, the raja-suya conscration of a king and the asva-medha, a  land conquering sacrifice of a successful king’s chariot horse. Two caves on  opposite sides of south India reveal significant inscriptional details, one at  Nanaghat, in the sharply defined gap in the western Ghats of Maharastra, the  other in Udayagi, Orissa, both dated as mid-first century bce. Two contempo rary kings emerge into focus here. The first is Satakarni I of the Satavahanas,  or the “Andhras” according to some Sanskrit Puranas, an enduring dynasty  that emerged from Mauryan roots in the second century bce. Satavahanas may  have originated in the Godavari Delta and expanded upriver to the headwaters  on the west coast not far from the Nanaghat cave. Origins are murky and it  is more probable that this dominion expanded in the opposite direction, west  to east. In any event, Satakarni I, imperial raja of the Satavahana capital at  Pratisthana (Paithan) on the upper Godavari, claimed to be lord (pati) of the  south (daksina-patha), and performed the great year-long drama of the Vedic  asva-medha, sacrifice of his intrepid horse that had staked out conquest with  the aid of a significant army. 

The 900 miles of the Godavari became a conduit for trade all the way from  the Arabian Sea to Konasima and the Bay of Bengal, with the Satavahanas  in control of most of the Deccan and beyond to the north. Amaravati, for a  time the Satavahana capital, became a powerful trade and pilgrimage center 

The Godavari Delta 9 

where craftsmen were renowned for bronzes of the Buddha and various ani mals. There is little historical evidence but according to Buddhist tradition  the enormously influential Madhyamika philosopher Nagarjuna lived in the  Satavahana period, perhaps in the second and third centuries ce, in the place  named for him, Nagarjuna-hill. Many kings favored Brahmans with land  grants and some took family names as “sons” of Vedic rsi such as Gotama  and Vasistha. After attaining their peak of power in the late second century ce,  Satavahanas were threatened by several tribes of Sakas from north India and it  was the Vakataka dynasty that finally replaced them in the third century. There  was an interlude of sovereignty by the Iksvaku dynasty with one king celebrat 

ing yet another asva-medha. 

The other powerful southern ruler and contemporary of Satakarni I was  Kharavela, one who also claimed adhi-pati status as ruler-in-chief over Kalinga  (Orissa and parts of modern Andhra). He was a Jaina, like Candragupta Maurya,  and was consecrated as king by the Vedic raja-suya sacrifice. Inscriptions about  him were found in the Jaina cave at Udayagiri.3 

#### 2 Contending Dynasties of Regional Kings 

The boasts of “southern” supremacy by Satakarni I  and Kharavela would  no doubt have been ridiculed by kings and chieftains farther south. The  Ceras (Keralas) on the west coast, the Colas who gave their name to the  east coast (Coromandal, the mandala of Colas), and the Pandyas in between,  competed for power over the territory during the early centuries ce, a pot 

pourri of kingdoms controlling villages and extracting revenue not only in  Tamil Nadu, “land of the Tamils,” but also parts of the northern Deccan and  up the Kalinga coast. Romila Thapar has aptly dubbed such contention a  “see-sawing of dynasties” with relatively equal military strength repeatedly  replacing one another in the same region. Hermann Kulke and Dietmar  Rothermund extend the image to “triangular contests” since conflicts were  often more than one on one.4 

Saka hegemony was ended with the rise of the Gupta empire. Some six  centuries after the accession of Candragupta Maurya, another Candragupta,  again at Pataliputra, founded a new imperial dynasty that came to be labeled  in the north as India’s classical age, a period that produced enduring works  in Sanskrit such as the poetry and dramas of Kalidasa and the Kama Sutra  of Vatsyayana. The years of Candragupta’s rule were 320–35. His son,  Samudragupta (r. 350–75), and great-grandson, Kumaragupta (r. 415–55), the  fourth successive emperor, extended the dynasty. Samudragupta exercised  the asva-medha to lay claim to universal sovereignty, presumably after the 

10 vedic voices 

initial agni-stoma rituals with soma drinking. His extraordinary rampage  down the east coast across Kalinga and on south through Pistapura and  Vengi on the Coromandal coast, ended with Kancipuram in Tamil Nadu. That  thousand-mile campaign, a show of force against more than a dozen kings  and their armies and subjects, must have required more than one stalwart  royal mount. 

Coastal Andhra, however, like much of the south, remained isolated from  that “universe” celebrated in Pataliputra. In the south, the Pallavas attained  domination and at least one seventh-century king performed, after his agni stoma, the Vedic vaja-peya, the “drink of strength” sacrifice (both detailed  later in Chapter 6). He ruled in a dynasty that outlasted most mentioned  so far, extending from the sixth through the ninth centuries. Centered in  Kancipuram (Samudragupta’s momentary trophy), Pallava armies sub 

dued much of the peninsula, including the richly productive coastal zone  of “Vengi” from the Krishna Delta up to the Godavari Delta. Cynthia Talbot  mined epigraphic records and labeled Vengi as the “core area” of Andhra in  this period.5 Here again land grants to Brahmans were frequent and inscrip 

tions indicate migrations from the north to Andhra. One copper plate records  the donation of a village in Guntur District, west of the Krishna River, to one  thousand Brahmans from the village of Ahicchatra on the Ganges.6 In South  India, Grantha was a script descended from southern Brahmi in use for  writing Vedic and classical Sanskrit texts and one regional variant appeared  in Vengi.7 

New iterations of warring dynasties ushered in new royal names and  centers of contending power. The Calukya dynasty founder Pulakesin (c.  503–66) performed a celebratory asva-medha in his capital of Vatapi (later  named Badami, the site in Karnataka of impressive Saiva, Vaisnava, and Jaina  caves). Calukyas and Pallavas alternated control over the eastern Deccan in  the sixth and seventh centuries, the Eastern Calukyas at Pithapuram just east  of the Godavari Delta again playing a prominent role. Calukyas even fought  one another out of Badami and Kalyani in the west as well as Vengi and  Pithapuram in the east. 

An aggressive entrant into the tournament of warfare was the Rastrakuta  dynasty. In north India, Harsa had ruled successfully from Kanauj for the  first half of the seventh century, 606–47, until he was opposed by Pulakesin  II and his Calukyan armies. After Harsa’s death the Rastrakutas commanded  the Deccan while the Pratiharas took charge in the north and the Palas in the  east c.  750. Every century was scarred by wars either civil or interstate. As  Nilakanta Sastri observed, however, almost perpetual warfare did not obstruct  cultural growth. He cites the magnificent rock-cut Siva temple in the complex 

The Godavari Delta 11 

of Hindu, Buddhist, and Jaina caves and temples at Ellora,8 carved under the  757–78 rule of the Rastrakuta king Krishna I during the period when Vengi on  the east coast was repeatedly changing administrations. 

It is difficult to separate hagiography from reliable history, but Saiva tradi tions credit Sankara, the eighth-century founder of the non-dualist Advaita  Vedanta school of philosophy, with the establishment of matha, religious cen ters, in the compass points of India’s geography. Kancipuram and Srngeri are  two in the south and a third, also neighboring Andha, is in Puri (Orissa) to  the east. Among Sankara’s many works are penetrating commentaries on the  Upanisads including the Taittiriya as well as the somewhat older Chandogya  and Brhadaranyaka. 

The decline of Buddhist influence in the Deccan was roughly parallel  to an ascent of Jainism. From their roots in Magadha, Jainas had migrated  south into Kalinga in the third century bce and then further south to Tamil  Nadu along merchant trade routes, populating parts of the Andhra coast  en route. Stone images of tirthankara are still turned up by farmers in the  Godavari Delta although today no one remembers Jaina communities.  A stronger Jaina migrant route was down the west coast to Maharastra and  Karnataka. 

In the ninth century, Jaina monks, nuns, and laity were favored by sev eral Rastrakuta kings, including Amoghavarsa who stepped down to become  a monk after a remarkable sixty-eight-year reign. Among those he favored  were residents of Biccolu, now in East Godavari District. Almost a century  later, another Rastrakuta king was Indra IV who underwent the sallekhana fast  to death in Sravanabelgola in 982.9 Some Eastern Calukyas were also royal  patrons. As a religion of non-violence and self-denial the Jaina faith would  appear to be an unlikely choice of warring kings. Kharavela, the permanently  warring ruler of Orissa in the first century bce, was a Jaina. Paul Dundas  perceives “images of striving, battle, and conquest” as appealing to the south  Indian martial society, the spiritually victorious monk being a model equal to  that of the warrior.10 

Periods of interfaith civility alternated with intense deadly conflicts with  other religious communities, militant Saivas in particular. Hindu revivalist  devotional movements and the early twelfth-century reforms of Ramanuja  effectively limited Jaina influence through the medieval period. Ramanuja’s  dissatisfaction with Sankara’s rigid monism, the equation of atman and brah 

man, coupled with his personal experience of Visnu, led him to generate a  Vedanta of “qualified non-dualism” (Visistadvaita) and his teachings spread  throughout the Deccan via new religious centers like those of Sankara four  centuries before him.

#### 3 The Emergence of Telugu Literature 

In the last few centuries bce Tamil speakers began to compose poetry and  prose that foreshadowed Sangam era classics of the first three centuries ce.  Gradually Tamil had taken on vocabulary and themes from Sanskrit. By the  close of the first millennium ce two more Dravidian languages, Telugu and  Kannada, followed suit with literary forms and sizable input from Sanskrit.  In the eleventh century Telugu classical poetry received its template from  the reworking of the first two and a half books of the Sanskrit Mahabharata  by Nannaya, a task continued on palm leaves in the thirteenth century by  Tikkana, another formidable and creative poet.11 Although both Nannaya  and Tikkana were Brahmans, Veda pandits or Brahmans as a class did not  monopolize the proliferation of Telugu literary works. Also in the thirteenth  century, Palkuri Somanatha produced the Basava Purana collection of leg ends of Virasaiva (Lingayata) saints who rejected Vedic textual authority, class  and caste hierarchy, funerary rites, and the whole enterprise of sacrifice. One  saint declared that his dog could chant the Vedas better than Brahman pan 

dits and the dog confirmed this.12 The other great Sanskrit epic also appeared  in a Telugu version in the fruitful thirteenth century only a few decades after  the Tamil Ramayana, the version composed by the poet Kampan. 

“First poet” and first Telugu grammarian Nannaya had enjoyed the patron age of king Rajaraja Narendra in Rajahmundry (medieval Rajamahendri) on  the Godavari after the Eastern Calukyas emerged phoenix-like in another  dynasty of their off and on again four-hundred-year run until the tenth cen tury and conquest by an energetic Cola king Rajaraja I (r. 985–1015). Rajaraja  was succeeded by his son Rajendra I (r. 1012–44). Rastrakuta chiefs as well  as other warring communities on the fringes of Vengi made shifts of power  nearly continuous. 

#### 4 The Kakatiya Dynasty at Warangal  

until 1322 

Warangal, midway between middle stretches of the Godavari and Krishna riv ers, had become the hub of the Kakatiya dynasty from the eleventh to the  beginning of the fourteenth centuries as the center of political control moved  inland from the coast. The most ambitious of its kings was Ganapati who  ruled more than sixty years c.1198–1262, corralling the two deltas (the enlarged  meaning of “Vengi”) within his kingdom. Subjugation of the coast occurred  on Ganapati’s way south to reduce Kanci in Tamil Nadu, one of his many victo rious battles having been fought at Pithapuram in the Godavari Delta.

The Godavari Delta 13 

The Kakatiyas divided Andhra into nadu, regions. Vengi nadu, the two  great river deltas, could boast 16,000 villages.13 Portions of regions, or coun ties, were called sima (as in Kona-sima), kotta, or sthala. Kakatiya rule wit nessed the growth of large temple towns, heavily trafficked pilgrim routes,  popularity of sacred vows (vrata), dedications of Siva linga, circumambulations  of sacred hilltops, and increased numbers of Telugu inscriptions. 

Draksarama temple in the Godavari Delta with eleventh- and twelfth-century  inscriptions is the oldest and most famous of the five designated Saiva arama,  pleasure grove residences of deities. The temple’s name is a corruption of  Daksa arama, the grove where the god Daksa tried but failed to perform his  infamous soma sacrifice, frequently described in the Puranas. Although mar 

ried to Sati, Daksa’s daughter, Siva was not invited to the great yajna. A shamed  Sati immolated herself and Siva erupted into his horrendous manifestation  as Virabhadra to destroy the sacrifice. A powerful cult of Virabhadra as lord  of enraged, deceased children exists in the delta today and no one imagines  performing a Vedic sacrifice near Draksarama. The temple there is the resi 

dence of Bhima (Rudra), a form of Rudra-Siva, and the universal goddess as  Manikyambika, one of India’s eighteen Sakti pitha.14 The grove is the site of  a poem by the poet Srinatha, famous for his translations of Sanskrit kavya into Telugu, and the poet does not fail to mention goddesses Gogalamma,  Nokalamma, Mandatalli, and Ghattyambika. 

Meditation centers (matha) like those attributed to Sankara and Ramanuja  also increased in the Kakatiya period, including one so secluded on the tiny  island of Pattisam that it is reached only by boat from either the Rajahmundry  or Kovvur banks of the Godavari. Despite its inaccessibility it is one of the five  great Saiva retreats of India, in the august company of Srisaila, Kalahasti, Kasi  (Varanasi), and Kedara. 

#### 5 A New Religion, Culture, and Polity: Islam  Enters the Deccan 

The grandson of Ganapati was Pratapa Rudra who ruled successfully, by most  accounts, from 1289 until the Delhi Sultan Ala-ud-din dispatched armies to  subdue the Kakatiya region. Sieges were laid, bargains were struck, but finally  the well-fortified city of Warangal and abundant Kakatiya armies were no  match for the battle-hardened cavalry tactics and leadership of Ulugh Khan.  Warangal fell in 1322 to the fifth successive Sultanate invasion and a captive  king Pratapa Rudra was under transport toward Delhi when he died near the  Namada River, perhaps by his own hand.15 It is noteworthy that Marco Polo 

14 vedic voices 

was traveling in Thanjavur and elsewhere in Tamil Nadu at the close of the  thirteenth century after Pratapa Rudra ruled the eastern Deccan. Consolidation of territory by the armies of the Delhi sultanate expanded  Muslim administrations south from the Narmada to the Krishna river and  east from the Arabian Sea to the Bay of Bengal, adding to Andhra culture  the Persian, Arabic, and to limited extent Urdu languages, the last written in  a Persian script. The majority of the population, however, remained Hindu.  Minor raja and chieftains continued to fight internal revolts and each other,  aided by the development of gunpowder artillery and new siege techniques  of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The script of the asva-medha, in  essence land grabbing at the expense of neighbors, was acted out even if no  ritual performance was scheduled. One can only imagine the continuing dev astation century after century as hungry armies, their mounts, and supply  trains trampled the crop fields of the fecund green delta and stole grain stores,  coconuts, herds, and perhaps even daughters and young wives before moving  on, only to return on the same route a few seasons later. 

Islam had represented a cultural tectonic shift for India in the north for  centuries before penetration of Muslim armies and civilians into the Deccan.  With conquest of the Godavari Delta, mosques began to replace some Hindu  temples. Already in 1324 Muhammad Tughluq (Ulugh Khan, who assumed the  Tughluq dynastic name after the conquest of Warangal the year before) erected  a mosque at Rajahmundry on the ruins of the Hindu temple of Venugopal.  His cousin Firoz Shah succeeded him in 1351 and helped to extend the Tughluq  dynasty to 1413 in a period of widespread construction of mosques, some cre ated by adding a pulpit after removal of all Hindu murti, allowing their stone  residences to remain intact.16 Under Ala-ud-din (d. 1316) Hindus were forced  to relinquish half of their harvests; now Brahmans felt for the first time the  burden of the jizya poll tax on non-Muslims. The Sultanate of Delhi was ter 

minated by Timur’s dreadful destruction of the city and its Hindu population  in 1398. 

#### 6 Vijayanagara c. 1346–1564 

A powerful rival to both the Hindu Kakatiyas of Warangal and the Muslim  Bahmani kingdoms arose in Karnataka as Vijayanagara, one of the largest for tifications in Asia with an eventual ten square miles within massive walls.  Lasting for almost three centuries, the “city of victory” dominated the center  of the southern peninsula from Hampi on the Tungabhadra River, a southern  tributary of the Krishna. In 1327, Muhammad Tughluq conquered the Kampili  dynasty that had succeeded the Hoysalas in Karnataka and thereby completed 

The Godavari Delta 15 

a clean sweep of Warangal and other old capitals of Deccan kings. A path was  clear for the building of a new Hindu kingdom at Vijayangara in 1336, only  twenty miles from the destroyed Kampili headquarters.17 

The fourteenth-century reign of Harihara II produced the works of two  illustrious scholars, Sayana, the gifted commentator on the Vedas, and  Madhava, founder of the Dvaita or dualist school of philosophy that directly  opposed Advaita Vedanta. Madhava countered Sankara in another respect: he  was a devotee of Visnu. Tradition insists the two were brothers although their  death dates are seventy years apart. Perhaps the most famous Vijayanagara  king was Krishna Deva Raya whose reign, 1509–29, was the centerpiece of the  Tuluva dynasty of rulers. Both the Godavari and Krishna deltas were politically  embraced under his rule and on the Coromandal coast wealthy ports such  as Masulipatam, Motupalli, and Pulicat attracted Dutch and other European  merchant settlers shortly after 1600. An effective king who forged alliances  with the Bahmani ruler Muhammad Shah, Deva Raya also drove the Gajapatis  back north into Orissa, thus ending some two centuries of hostilities with the  other great medieval Hindu kingdom in the south. That long contest pitted  two neighbors against one another, speakers of different language families,  Dravidian Telugu and Indo-Aryan Oriya. The “god-king” Deva Raya traded  successfully with the Portuguese in Goa who provided him with modern arts  of artillery. His support base for two decades was the solidarity of those he  appointed as provincial governors, nayaka (Telugu nayakudu). An enduring  expression of sixteenth-century architecture during Krishna Deva Raya’s reign  was a unique style of temple construction.18 

Vijayanagara, “City of Victory,” despite its size, wealth, and vaunted  million-man army, did not live up to its name when it was destroyed in 1564  during the battle of Talikota by an alliance of the Golconda sultanate and  two others of the five Bahmani kingdoms. That alliance did not survive long  but the Qutb Shah dynasty of Golconda was able to occupy both deltas and  Rajahmundry as well. Hyderabad, future capital of the twentieth-century state  of Andhra Pradesh, was established in 1589 a few miles from Golconda fort.  The Qutb Shah succession of Shi’a kings lasted from 1512 until Golconda fell  to the armies of Aurangzeb and Sunni Mughal rule in 1687. 

The empire of the Mughals, founded 1526, had succeeded the Delhi  Sultanate in the north but did not expand into the Deccan immediately,  not even during large-scale expansion under Akbar who ruled 1556–1605.  A seventeenth-century obstacle to Mughal authority in the western Deccan was  Sivaji (1627–80), a short but intrepid Maratha general who managed to unite  Maratha Brahmans and warrior castes, then contrived an alliance of Telugu  Brahmans and Abul Hassan, the Qutb Shah Sultan of the Golconda kingdom.16 vedic voices 

Sivaji had himself crowned universal emperor in 1674 with 11,000 Brahmans  reciting Vedas.19 While his 60,000-man army camped near Golconda Sivaji  took considerable time to worship Bhramarambha, the goddess-consort of his  namesake Siva on Sri Saila (Srisala), the remote hilltop above the Krishna  River.20 After the death of Sivaji, Mughal armies conquered the Bijapur  Sultanate capital in 1686 and in the following year Golconda fort also fell.  Maratha guerilla tactics, however, made it impossible for Mughals to secure  territory and they suffered horrendous losses while retreating northward.  Aurangzeb, emperor since 1658, having squandered his waning years in vain  attempts at pacification, died in 1707, the volatile Deccan having remained “a  bridge too far” for the Mughals. 

Aside from major and minor territorial wars among Hindu dynasties,  from the seventh century on through the medieval period religious conflicts  sprouted between Jainas and Vedic Brahmans regarding animal sacrifices.21 Although some reports may have been exaggerated, inscriptional evidence  records that Jainas suffered periodic repressions at the hands of militant Saivas  who included cultural heroes such as the poet Tikkana. Jainism, Buddhism,  Virasaivism, and Tantric Hinduism had all contested Brahmanical tradition  and each ultimately left its mark. Islam in the Deccan, however, produced  in the pre-European centuries a different response, not unlike the effect that  Christianity, another monotheistic religion with global reach, was to exert in  succeeding centuries. And it must be said that Islam and Christianity both  took on new guises in their encounters with south Indian culture and religion. 

#### 7 Arrival of the Europeans 

Greek and Roman merchant ships in the last centuries bce and early centuries  CE most certainly viewed and perhaps explored the Krishna and Godavari del tas along the Coromandal coast. European colonization of the subcontinent,  however, did not begin until well after Vasco da Gama landed four ships at  Calicut on the Kerala coast in 1498. The early arriving Portuguese concen trated on India’s Arabian Sea coast. A century later the east coast on the Bay of  Bengal was the target of Dutch, Danish, and French traders as well as the even tually all-encompassing English.22 Dutch merchant ships dominated trade in  the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries but the English slowly caught up  and then surpassed them. In the seventeenth century the English East India  Company established from modest origins three seaports, Madras, Bombay,  and Calcutta, each to become one of the famous megalopolises of modern  India, Chennai, Mumbai, and Kolkata, respectively.

The Godavari Delta 17 

A visit today to the coastal town of Machilipatnam, barely thirty-eight miles  from the mouth of the Vasistha-Godavari and close to the northern mouth of  the Krishna Delta, reveals little of its fame more than four centuries ago as  Masulipatam, the busiest and wealthiest seaport on the eastern seaboard.23 

It was the site of a Dutch weaving center established in 1606 by the VOC,  Vereenigde Oost-Indische Comagnie, the United East India Company. English  traders were not slow in recognizing the value of the remarkable textiles and  organized Weaver-caste families five years later. Danish merchants, having  settled farther south on the Coromandal coast at Tranquebar in 1620, became  in 1625 the third European nation to focus on Masulipatam.24 

Many Weaver families in the Godavari Delta contributed their specialty in  calicoes with designs penned onto the cloth with vegetable dyes in the tech nique of kalam-kari. A Dutch census in 1680 accounted for eighteen weaving  centers near Draksarama alone. Villages with 40 to 900 Weaver families each  had an average 418 looms per village,25 an incredibly energetic homespun  industry for Godavari weavers in the seventeenth century. It meant then, as  it does today, employment of every able member of the household. English  entrepreneurs eventually followed the Dutch deeper into the Godavari Delta  to Jagannathapuram. In addition to the main attraction, calicoes, exports  included raw silk, yarn, and printed cloth, diamonds, sapphires, and rubies  from Golconda and other mines, as well as cotton, sugar, teak, and even  slaves. These brought fortunes of staggering size to European merchants,  one diamond merchant in London, for example, profiting 100,000 pounds  in the year 1676.26 By 1680, however, Madras had emerged from its sleepy  1639 origins as Fort St. George to rival Masulipatam as the east coast port of  choice.27 Given over to the British by the Dutch in 1825 was another famous  Coromandal port, Pulicat, in use as early as the third century bce by the Cola  and Pallava kingdoms. 

The French also settled along the Coromandal coast, their equivalent of the  East India Companies of the Dutch, English, and Danes being La Compagnie  Francaise des Indes Orientales. Their 1674 colony at Pondicherry obtained  from the Dutch additional ports at Karikal and Yanam (Yanaon), the latter  in the Godavari Delta on the northern branch of the Gautami-Godavari, a  deep-water shelter not far from the sea. Yanam, French from 1731 until it was  turned over to India in 1954, was something of a back door into the lucra 

tive textile and diamond exports. A visit in the 1980s seeking some lingering  expertise in the making of wine and bread disclosed that the old customs bor der between India and “France” was still evident, but only a walled cemetery,  the village toilet, spoke of a former Gallic presence.

18 vedic voices 

By 1736, English East India Company ships eliminated French traders from  the Coromandal coast, although Pondicherry, Karikal, and Yanam remained  French territory until 1945. The English East India Company had won the  day, and from the remainder of the eighteenth century until formation of the  Republic of India in 1947 the Godavari Delta was in the Madras Presidency  (established in 1653)28 where it had been situated in 1768. By 1800, all access  to roads and property in the Presidency was governed by the Company.29 

After the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857, for which the House of Commons blamed  Company mismanagement, 1858 witnessed a transition from Company rule  to the British Raj. 

#### 8 Domesticating the Delta 

Everywhere on domestic, business, and civic walls, and especially on trees at  crossroads and river banks, there are posters and statues of divine beings— Hanuman, Ganesa, all possible avatara of Devi, Siva, or Visnu, and the occasional  god-man or god-woman stepping back from history into myth—Shirdi Sai Baba  or Sarada Devi, for example. Images of two male figures with historical focus  are ubiquitous in the delta, as indeed they are in most of India. One is Gandhi,  seated cross-legged or in mid-stride, staff in resolute hand, spectacles prominent  on a wizened face. The other is the Dalit and neo-Buddhist hero B. R. Ambedkar  posed stiffly in white shirt, red tie, and improbable blue suit, his arm pointing  out the hope of progress somewhere on the horizon. But in the water-rich deltas  of the Godavari and Krishna, as nowhere else in the subcontinent, a third male  figure may be seen in landscape statuary, either in standing pose alone in the flat  space of a paddy field or in the saddle of a spirited brown stallion. 

Remarkably, since most other signs of the Raj have been thoroughly scrubbed  away in more than sixty years of independence, this modest black-suited figure  is a white man, namely, Sir Arthur Cotton, the nineteenth-century British mil itary officer and civil engineer who tamed the indomitable Godavari River at  the end of its rush across the Deccan to the sea. His extraordinary accomplish ments began with transformation of the former Rajahmundry District from  one of the poorest and most famine-prone to the rice-basket of south India.  The delta was accordingly renamed Godavari District and statues of a white  man, a saint although a dora, a Foreigner, sprouted from this well-watered,  now fruitful land. 

In 1844, Cotton (1803–99) studied the Godavari flood plain and visual ized the building of a 2.25-mile-wide masonry anicut forty-eight-feet thick,  a weir or dam known locally as a barrage. He envisioned it across the river  at Daulesvaram with a series of sluice gates leading into several hundreds of 

The Godavari Delta 19

canals that would not only control the flow of water for irrigation but also cre ate safe river traffic of 1,500 miles for both goods and people (see Figure 1.1).  Begun in 1847, completed only five years later in 1852, this enormous project  changed agricultural life in its rhythms, output, and diversity, and made the  delta a prime example of the benefits of large-scale hydraulic engineering.  The horrendous rampages of monsoon flooding on the many streams of the  delta, an annual rearrangement of every island and shore for scores of miles,  became a thing of the past, although serious floods from breeches of levees,  locally known as bands, still occur, most recently in 1986 when the river  crested at Rajahmundry and left damaged crops and dwellings along much of  its course. But the era of large-scale drought-related famines was ending. In  1832–33, after a cyclone killed tens of thousands outright, even more died of  famine because of devastated crops. 

In 1866 in Orissa, the state on the northern border of Andhra, 1.5 million  people starved to death. Cotton poked a finger in the eye of the government  that later was to knight him by calculating the exact number of cubic yards of  water and the two-thirds of a penny a pound for rice for four months of food  that would have saved the Orissans, not forgetting to cite the huge loss in gov 

ernment revenue because nothing was done. “How strange it seems that men  cannot understand this,” he wrote in 1881. In the newly renamed Godavari  

20 vedic voices 

District, after Cotton’s efforts and the irrigation of 600,000 acres, the popula tion increased 300 percent from 1843 to 1891. 

Cotton went on to tame the Krishna River Delta with another anicut west of  Rajahmundry at Vijayawada. He became chief engineer of Madras Presidency,  applying his skills in other parts of India as well. A huge waterway system was  envisioned, little of which was realized, that also included proposals for a vast  east coast set of canals for 380 miles between the Godavari and Madras, the  use of wind power to raise water for irrigation, possibilities in Egypt and the  Sudan, and even a fanciful vision of linked Indian and Chinese river systems  from the Brahmaputra to the Yangtze.30 

Transformation of the delta came about in many ways. Two years after  India’s first telegraph line was installed, the first passenger train chugged  along rails in 1853, with rapid expansion over the next several decades. Before  the close of that century it became essential for the Calcutta-Madras east coast  line to cross the Godavari at Rajahmundry, a formidable feat of railway engi 

neering over a wandering river. The first single-track rail line spanned the two  miles between Rajahmundry and Kovvur in 1897 on one of the longest bridges  in Asia. Through the 1980s the old puffer-billy steam locomotives were still  waking people of Rajahmundry before dawn as they performed their explo 

sive morning warm-ups like donkeys greeting the sun. Prior to road, rail, and  telegraph links connecting the western and eastern portions of the delta, boat  traffic was restricted to the calm seasons of the river. As will be apparent in  Chapter 3, deep-seated liaisons between Vaidika families in the delta, particu 

larly those for marital and ritual purposes, were vastly improved by a century  of enhanced communication, the latest innovation being a cell phone in every  household in each agrahara where no landline had previously existed. 

The destructive role of water can be far more than the expected annual  floods. The delta, wide open to the Bay of Bengal, is highly vulnerable to tropi cal cyclones (hurricanes, typhoons) and tsunamis roaring inland behind storm  surges, walls of ocean water ten to thirty feet high. Kakinada and Masulipatam  were destroyed by cyclones in the early nineteenth century and many storms  with high fatalities have struck since, most recently, 1969, 1977, 1984, 1990,  and 1996. The 1977 cyclone drove eight miles inland, killing nearly 10,000  people. TV and cell-phone evacuation warnings saved tens of thousands in the  cyclone of October 2013. 

During the period of research for this book, at 5 pm on November 6, 1996,  four days before the great autumn harvest festival of Divali, as Venkatesvara,  Lord of Andhra, was readied in his Tirupati temple for adornment with  diamond-studded gold jewels, a cyclone roared up through Konasima and  killed perhaps 2,000 people during a ten-hour rampage. Numbers were 

The Godavari Delta 21 

imprecise when 1,400 villages were affected, virtually all mud-thatch houses  disappeared, and pakka houses of brick and cement blew down or became  roofless. Newly harvested paddy along with 1.5 million acres of rice fields were  destroyed, and the other lifeline, coconut palms, were decapitated with five to  eight years required to replace them. Konasima was several years in regaining  its cornucopia reputation. Venkatesvara, said many farmers, was angry with  us for our sins, while as many others feared it was their neighborhood god 

dess, who was sure to do it all again. No one spoke of many crores of rupees  devoted to sea walls on the east sides of towns that might have mitigated dam age. While engineering skills have largely tamed the river, winds and far off  earthquakes have remained wild. 

A significant aspect of neighborhood goddesses in villages, town, and cit ies is their ambiguity. They are fierce, violent, blood-demanding creatures,  carriers of epidemic diseases, destructive beyond measure. They are also  benevolent, merciful, loving, and maternal. Collectively, generically, they are  Ammavaru, Mother. Individually, in their temples and shrines, and in the  annual festivals in the neighborhoods they patrol from border to border, they  are Gangamma, Somalamma, Nukalamma, Paiditalli, and so on. The earlier  description exactly describes the delta’s great river, a life-giver, a life-taker. 

#### 9 Creating a Modern Telugu Language State 

The historian of Andhra, P. Raghunanda Rao, credits English education for  intellectual and social reforms leading to the “awakening of Andhra” from  medieval stupor.31 The University of Madras originated in 1857 and by 1873 a  government college for the Godavari Delta was established in Rajahmundry.  Labeled by the Veda pandits huna-vidya, the practice of the Huns (a  heavy-handed reference to British colonials), the Brahmans were wary of an  educational system that interfered with traditional Vedic culture.32 The English  curriculum and its enlightenment ideology did in fact produce rapid change.  A battery of educated and energetic reformers arose and coastal Andhra con tributed a fair share. The combination of traditional learning and superior  social status of Brahmans was an advantage. According to Kenneth Jones,  “between 1876–86 Brahmans accounted for 73% of all successful candidates  in Madras University.”33 

Among the Andhra luminaries three nationally influential personalities  deserve special mention, all of them born in the mid or late nineteenth cen tury. Kandukuri Virasalingam (1848–1919), born in Rajahmundry, was a lucky  survivor of childhood smallpox. Considered by many to be the most significant  Andhran of modern times, he was a tireless and aggressive social reformer. 

22 vedic voices 

He earned the enmity of traditional authorities, including the Sankaracarya of  Kancipuram and many Vaidika Brahmans, by championing female education  and widow remarriage with dramatically staged ceremonies for maximum  notoriety. 

To Virasalingam, his opponents were Lilliputians and he lampooned them  in an essay mirroring Jonathan Swift. He published journals and pamphlets,  wrote two plays, and lectured widely. Having established the first schools  for girls in 1874, as well as others for Untouchable boys, he officiated at the  first widow remarriage in Rajahmundry in 1881 and later formed the Widow  Remarriage Association for continuing ceremonies. Today a large and thriving  women’s college in Rajahmundry bears the name of his wife, Rajalaksmi.34 

Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (1888–1975) is a well-known name to general  readers as well as Indologists because of his highly influential books. He  translated from Sanskrit The Principal Upanishads and published Indian  Philosophy, the Philosophy of the Upanishads, an Idealist View of Life, Eastern  Religions and Western Thought, East and West: Some Reflections, and Recovery  of Faith, all between 1923 and 1955. He was the first vice president of India  in 1952–62 before serving as president in 1962–67. His distinguished roles  included Oxford University professor of eastern religion and ethics (1936–52),  chairman of UNESCO (1946–52), vice chancellor of Andhra University and  Banaras Hindu University, and chancellor of Delhi University. Born in a tradi tional Brahman family in Tirupati, he was educated there at the Hermansburg  Evangelical Lutheran Mission School where he earned a scholarship to Madras  University, thus launching a famous career. His birthday, September 5, is now  celebrated as Teachers’ Day.35 

Another Godavari Delta figure of national reputation was Pattabhi  Sitaramayya (1888–1959), born in a non-Vaidika Brahman family in Gundugola  in the same year as Radhakrishnan. By profession he was first a physician in  Machilipatnam but left practice to join the Nationalist Movement. Prominent  there from 1920 until independence, he spent eight of those years in British  prisons. After release he continued disruptive agitations toward the formation  of a separate state for speakers of Telugu.36 The labors of Sitaramayya and  many others had lasting effect: in 1956, Andhra Pradesh became the first of  India’s “language states,” 88 percent of its people being Telugu speakers. In  2013–14, agitation arose in the Telangana interior region regarding formation  of a new state divorced from the wealthier and better educated coastal zone of  the two deltas. If the central government approves, Telangana’s ten districts  will comprise the twenty-ninth state of India, Hyderabad to serve as shared  capital for the next decade. The two Godavari districts will remain among the  thirteen districts of Andhra Pradesh.

The Godavari Delta 23 

Earlier, in 1925, two districts bracketing the Vasistha Godavari were cre ated out of the former Rajahmundry District that in Arthur Cotton’s time  had been renamed Godavari District. East Godavari District had its head quarters in Kakinada while West Godavari District was governed from Eluru.  Similarly, the single polity of Krishna District was split into the adjacent dis tricts of Krishna and Guntur. Just as Rajahmundry is the largest town but not  headquarters of East Godavari, so is Vijayawada the largest town in Krishna  District while Eluru serves as the seat of governance. Rajahmundry, on the  east bank of the Godavari, is forty-two miles from Kakinada, a distance that  can be covered by express bus in one hour whereas in 1980 it usually required  three to four. 

The twentieth century is reflected in the living memories of many of the  Brahmans in this narrative. World War I, that shuddered through Europe and  the Ottoman Empire and profoundly affected North America, was scarcely  remembered by the older pandits and wives; but two decades later, World  War II, with Japanese submarines in the Bay of Bengal and some 2 million  Indians in the uniform of the British army, left impressions on those born  in the first half of the century. Soon after that war ended in 1945, however,  January 26, 1947, Independence Day for India, is a date that brought joy  to the older folks, all of them remembering Jawaharlal Nehru, “Pandit-ji,”  who lived until 1964. They also recall the local shake-up in September 1948  when the new Indian army corraled the Nizam and delivered Hyderabad,  one of the last two “princely states,” to control by the Republic of India.37 Many events, movements of the freedom fighters and the turbulent period  of independence, Gandhi’s salt march and satya-graha, emergence of the  Communist Party of India, unfolded at a far remove from the delta although  coastal Andhra contributed numerous leaders, and local newspapers kept  people informed. 

### 3 Agrahara, Villages, and  

Pilgrimage Towns 

When the dora (the author of this book) and his wife began residence directly  on the left bank of the undivided Godavari in 1980, the state of Andhra  Pradesh, an area slightly less than the Italian peninsula, had a population  of about 53 million. By 2011 the population had ballooned to nearly 85 mil 

lion, an increase of 32 million, well over the combined populations of all five  Scandinavian countries, and Andhra was adding more than a million per year.  Substantial transformations of landscape and culture were quite apparent all  the while.

24 vedic voices 

The search for ahitagni began in the village of Munganda close to the left  bank of the Vasistha Godavari.38 No Vedic ritualists were to be found, and  teaching of the Vedas had long since expired. Authentic Vedic sacrificers, how ever, were reported to be living in agrahara not far away, although at the time,  winding, deteriorating roads and footpaths made the distance seem daunting.  Directions northeast to a cluster of villages hugging the Billakurru Canal (west  of Nedunuru on Map 2) led to a wide neighborhood that included six ahitagni and several other pandits vigorously teaching Veda. 

An agrahara, an entirely Brahman community, is usually an appendage  of a village or hamlet, separated, private, yet close enough to obtain necessary  supplies and household or field labor from the larger adjoining settlement.  Those discussed here are donations of land by wealthy admirers of Vedic tradi 

tion who provided plots for house construction and small amounts of rice and  coconut acreage for Veda pandits and a few other Brahmans.39 Such gifts of  land have a long history. Cynthia Talbot notes a special tradition in medieval  Andhra, sapta-santana, “seven offerings,” by which donors could perpetuate  their names.40 In addition to having a son, other legacies include provision of  a deity image to a temple, constructing a tank for water supply, and donating  an agrahara. Agrahara have secluded lanes, what might be called gated com 

munities in America. Although invisible, the gateway is clearly understood by  the far larger non-Brahman population as a threshold into a zone of privilege.  Crop fields are sometimes intruded upon, not residential lanes. 

Sriramapuram agrahara, established in 1940 in land grants to respected  Veda pandits by a wealthy merchant, Dokka Rama, originally contained a sin gle straight dirt lane of fourteen houses and a panca-ayatana (five-deity) tem ple housing Isvara, Radha-krsna, Surya, Ambika, and Vighnesvara (Ganesa)  (see Figure 0.6). Added to the lane over the years were a small school, play ground, post office, and two separate shrines for Subrahmanya and Dattatreya,  respectively. Although all Brahman, an agrahara such as Sriramapuram is by  no means uniform. Vaidika Brahmans live distinct lives and do not marry or  dine with laukika non-Vaidika Brahmans living next door. Within Vaidikas, the  families of ahitagni cannot eat food cooked by non-ahitagni wives. 

Kamesvari agrahara, more remote from any main road, has only a few  houses on a trio of adjoining short lanes. At the height of Vedic activity in  Konasima, four ahitagni, sacrificers who maintain three sacred fires in their  homes, and several other Veda pandits who taught Vedas to their own sons  and often to the sons of others, lived in these two agrahara less than three  miles apart on opposite sides of the Amalapuram canal. A mile and a half west  of Sriramapuram is the village of Vyaghresvaram, at one time agrahara-like 

The Godavari Delta 25 

in size, and the locus of three other ahitagni, creating a circle of seven within  walking distance of one another. 

Another Vedic community that blurs the distinction between agrahara and village is Iragavaram, West Godavari District, where a strong presence of  Veda pandits in a Brahman hamlet maintains a multigenerational heritage.  Iragavaram is across the Godavari River from Konasima in what became West  Godavari District after the division of Godavari District into two parts. 

Kakinada town, some twenty-five miles northeast of the Sriramapuram Vyaghresvaram-Nedunuru cluster but only fifteen miles north of the Gautami  Godavari, is a seaport on the Bay of Bengal. The next locus for this narra tive, it is home to a single ahitagni, Bhamidipati Mitranarayana. Formerly  known as Cocanada, the town is the seat of government for East Godavari  District. On the shore of the Bay of Bengal it is the largest seaport between  Vishakhapatnam and Machilipatnam. Strong canals from all directions have  provided fresh water for a century and a half. Despite small industries and  ship traffic there are still beautiful stretches of sand beaches close to town. 

Nomenclature for the region is sometimes confusing although not as dras tic as the change in name from Madras to Chennai. As Cocanada became  Kakinada and Machilipatnam became the modern name for Masulipatam, so  did Daksarama evolve into Draksarama. Vijayawada is still frequently referred  to as Bezwada, its medieval name. 

Many other towns come into the conversations of the pandits, their  wives, and children, particularly the many pilgrimage goals (tirtha) in the  sacred geography of coastal Andhra. The medieval period produced a num ber of Hindu temples that achieved fame through their mahatmya, Sanskrit  or Telugu depictions of their foundation mythologies and subsequent histo ries. Undoubtedly the primary target today is the Tirupati Vaisnava temple  complex of the Lord of the Seven Hills, Venkatesvara, patron deity of Andhra.  Until recently the temple took pride for many decades in its reputation as the  wealthiest in India. In the town in the valley lives Venkatesvara’s sister, the  feared goddess Gangamma.41 

While in this southernmost tip of Andhra many pilgrims broaden sectar ian devotion by having darsana of the linga in the Saiva temple at Kalahasti,  only twenty-two miles from Tirupati. The temple dates from the Pallava  dynasty, rebuilt in the eleventh century by a Cola king. Kalahasti owns one  of the five elemental linga of Saivism, the panca-bhuta linga, this one of wind,  Vayu, the name of a Vedic god with Indo-Iranian roots. It is also the site where  Kanappa, a devotee famous in Tamil Saiva hagiography, offered his eyes to  restore those of a bleeding linga. Kalahasti boasts of being the southern Kasi  (Varanasi, Benares).26 vedic voices 

In addition to Draksarama, described earlier, three more of the sacred  arama are in the delta. One is Bhimavaram (with another Bhima temple) and  a second is Kurma arama, Turtle Grove, in a village better known as Kotipalli  frequented by the Vedic rsi Kasyapa. Siva as Lord of soma, the sacred Vedic  plant, resides in his temple there. The third is Palakol (Palakollu), also known  as Ksiraratna, the Milk Grove, with a linga temple now known via sectarian  blending as Ksira Rama-lingesvara. 

All of these towns with medieval temples attract great crowds of pilgrims,  particularly at Maha-Sivaratri, the “great night of Siva” when everyone remains  awake in devotion. Fierce gods—Virabhadra, Rudra, Bhima, Bhairava,  Narasimha—as well as Bhadrakali and other ferocious goddesses of every  stripe seem to dominate the landscape from their thousand-year-old palaces  of stone. 

Other coastal Andhra pilgrimage goals within reach of bus, train, or boat  include two temple towns that employ a pair of prominent Veda pandit broth ers featured in this book. One will most likely become an ahtagni in 2016.  One town is Simhacalam west of Visakhapatnam with its eleventh-century  hill temple enclosing a Siva linga for an entire year but for the one day in  May when sandal paste somehow melts away to reveal an image of the  Vaisnava god Narasimha, the true lord of Simhacalam who destroyed the  demon king Hiranyakasipu precisely there. The other town is Annavaram in  the north of East Godavari District with an equally popular temple, also on a  hilltop, Ratnagiri, residence of the god Satyanarayana and goddess Satyavati.  Annavaram also demonstrates sectarian rapprochement since the Vaisnava  god is flanked by a Siva linga as well as the goddess. 

Until recent improvement of roads approaching their towns, two renowned  temples exacted intimidating journeys from pilgrims. One is Bhadracalam,  accessible by boat some one hundred miles up the Godavari from Rajahmundry.  Boat people still today are reluctant to go ashore in mid journey. Invariably  they “cut” white chickens and break coconuts for the Breech Mother goddess  Gandi Posamma at the wide bend of the river south of Devipatnam in hopes  of avoiding tigers, crocodiles, and bandits. Only the last have actually been  sighted for a generation. She stands guard exactly where treacherous territory  begins, with a gleaming five-foot sword in her right hand. Beyond the break in  the Northern Circars, Bhadracalam is the site of a temple of Rama built at the  place where Sita was kidnapped by Ravana. Temple attendants reveal bedrock  that bled when construction began, declaring that the great goddess is there,  and was there, before the Ramayana heroes. 

The other remote temple is Srisaila, the only south Indian temple men tioned in the Mahabharata. Millions of pilgrims have worn the road’s 

The Godavari Delta 27 

cobblestones into rounded knobs as smooth as eggs. Located on a wilderness  hilltop high above the Krishna River, the temple is the sacred space of Siva as  Mallikarjuna and goddess Bhramaramba, a manifestation of Kali. As the linga in Kalahasti is one of five elements, this Srisaila linga is one of a famous set of  twelve jyotir linga, forms of divine light. 

Pilgrims count other towns on their itineraries as well. They visit Kanaka  Durga in her hilltop temple in Vijayawada, Narasimha in yet another of his  temples atop the elephant-shaped hill in nearby Mangalagiri, and Markandeya  in his temple on the Godavari River in Rajahmundry (Rajahmahendravaram),  an eleventh-century fortress town now favored as cultural center for coastal  Andhra. Considered the birthplace of the Telugu language, Rajahmundry was  the home of the poet Nannaya, author of three books of the Telugu Mahabharata.  His benefactor was Rajaraja Narendra, the Calukyan king of Vengi during  the first half of the eleventh century. Every twelve years Rajahmundry hosts  “Pushkaram” when the Godavari takes its turn among India’s greatest rivers  for pilgrim bathers. In 2003 some 34 million were claimed by locals to have  taken the sacred dip at half a dozen revu, the Telugu word for bathing ghats. 

Throughout coastal Andhra, in softer focus and without literary recogni tion but for an occasional paper pamphlet, are numerous diminutive temples  and shrines of neighborhood goddesses, many of them renowned for resident  possession ritualists who embody them and become their voices in service of  supplicants.42 They are to be located mostly on word-of-mouth maps still in  use by the roughly one-third of the population who do not read. 

Further remarks on agrahara will precede the capsule biographies of Veda  pandits at the outset of Chapter 3 and the lives of householders living in these  Brahman communities will be the subject of Chapter 5.43

## 2 Vedamlo, “Living in the Veda” 

### 1 The Vocabulary of the Veda Pandit 

Essential for an understanding of the structure of Vedic tradition are certain  key terms that are common parlance among Vedic Brahmans. These will come  into play in the personal biographies in Chapter 3. The Glossary at the end of  the book includes these terms along with others appearing less frequently, all  of them being Sanskrit unless noted as Telugu. A reader may wish to refer back  to pages here at the outset of this chapter for context and details in addition to  the brief Glossary definitions. This chapter serves as a primer in living Vedic  tradition by introducing first the basic educational system of Vedic pandits  (Brahmans in hereditary Vedic families) as practiced today in coastal Andhra,  then an outline of choices for maintaining samsara, the worldly subsistence  of married and certified Veda pandit householders. The third section enters  the life of srauta, the extended sacrificial tradition of those who establish three  fires and become eligible to proceed to soma rituals.1 This requires presenta tion of a whole new vocabulary and advanced set of procedures. A fourth sec 

tion follows with attention to the remarkable liaisons between householders,  both husband and wife, and their ritual hearth complex, known as agni-hotra and as Agni-hotra, the god Agni, Lord of the house and family. 

During initial conversations in an agrahara it is immediately stressed  that certain Brahmans “exist in Veda,” vedamlo unnaru, a Telugu locative des ignation setting them apart from—and implicitly above—all others. A hier archy recognizes the special character of the Vaidika subcaste of Brahmans  who have retained “Brahmahood,” brahma-tva, while others have fallen  from their natural heritage and become laukika, literally “worldly,” secular  Brahmans. The latter are always the great majority of the Brahmana varna or class. The privilege of being first in the pecking order carries the burden  of being responsible for Veda. Having been born into the Taittiriya sakha, 

Vedamlo, “Living in the Veda” 29 

“branch,” of the Vedic textual corpus, the primary division of the Krsna or  Black Yajur Veda, a Vaidika boy of seven or eight years may be given over  to a guru for hearing and reciting back a lesson (adhyaya). It is a process of  reciting by heart a portion of the Taittiriya Samhita, the copious initial col 

lection of this Black Yajur Veda. The English translation by A. B. Keith is 637  pages long, but of course the boy is aware not of pages but of oral lessons  broken into manageable portions.2 A “subject” or “course” of study might  be a more apt translation since his curriculum extends to eighty-two panna 

over a period of eight to twelve years including text-courses well beyond  the Taittiriya Samhita. An American student may cover approximately the  same number of “subjects” of study in twelve years of grade school and high  school. Memorization, however, is quite another matter and in US schools  may be limited to a couple of resentfully learned poems or the Gettysburg  Address, all quickly forgotten.3 

The boy begins his career as a reciter of Veda by undergoing the life-cycle  ritual (samskara) known as upanayana, investiture with a sacred thread over his  left shoulder. He hears from his guru his first mantra, the gayatri (also known as  the savitri), Rg Veda 3.62.10, concerning the divine sun, awakener of the mind: 

tat savitur varenyam / bhargo devasya dhimahi / dhiyo yo nah pracodayat May we achieve the divine splendor of Savitr; may he illumine our minds. 

He will recite the Gayatri and other mantras every day for the rest of his life in  sandhya-vandana while sprinkling water offerings at the samdhya, “joints” of  the day, twilight and dawn, when the sun (Savitr or Surya) sets or rises. This  initiation begins brahmacarya, the first of four asrama or stages of life, that of  the celibate student, brahmacarin. By becoming a Vedic student and reciting  Veda in sandhya-vandana he is already discharging one of the three important  rna, “debts,” in the life of every Brahman, the one to the ancient rsi who first  intuited the Veda (see Table 2.1). The other two he will pay off, respectively, to  the gods by sacrificing and to his ancestors by fathering children.

The upanayana ceremony involves the god Brhaspati, purohita (priest) of  the gods and also patron of learning. In Telugu he is known as Guru, the  deity of Thursday. AGS 4.10-11 with mantras in the second part of the sepa rate Mantrapatha supply a concise program for the seven- or eight-year-old  boy, beginning with his bath and the tonsure of his head with a razor. He is  instructed to place kindling sticks into the fire and then is directed to place  his right foot on a grindstone; put on a new loincloth, a belt of three strands  of munja grass, and a strip of antelope hide; then receive as staff (danda) a  slim branch from a palasa tree. He sprinkles himself three times with water  received into his cupped hands from the guru who places a three-stranded  white cotton thread over his right shoulder. After hearing initial mantras he  addresses his guru and declares himself ready as a brahmacarin.4 

After this thread-investiture the student lives in the residence of his earthly  guru, in modern times most probably his father, grandfather, or older brother.  In other words, he continues to live at home. In earlier times, and in some  cases still today, the initial guru is an uncle or someone outside the immediate  family residence and the student then lives in the guru’s home and eats food  cooked by his guru’s wife, one who serves as interim mother. Proper food for  the growing boy is extremely important and serves not only as correct nurtur 

ance for mind, body, and spirit but also a means of bonding with the larger  community. The brahmacarin goes about collecting food by begging from vari ous Vaidika Brahman houses in the agrahara or village. Like a honey bee col lecting pollen he is a “honey-maker,” madhu-kara, and cooked food is dropped  into a cloth bag slung from his neck that he extends toward the door when  a woman answers his call (see Figure 2.1). An alternative “begging” routine,  varalu, assigns the boy to a different house on each of the seven days of the  week, thus the Telugu plural of vara, weekday. Either way, he is in the mode  of the ascetic, the samnyasin or sadhu who is dependent on the largesse of  ordinary householders while on his spiritual quest. In his case it is the quest  for knowledge of Veda. A few boys may be enrolled by their parents in a Veda  patha-sala, a school for learning Veda such as the one in Kapilesvarapuram  shown in Figure 2.2. 

Along with his daily meditation prayers the student also becomes con scious of his personal relationship with Agni through daily fire maintenance,  agni-karya, collecting kindling sticks (samidh), removing the ashes of old fires,  and tending the household fire of his guru (see Figure 2.3, a brahmacarin car rying a fire-pot in the house of his father and guru, a potential ahitagni). He is  rehearsing for that day when he first establishes a household fire for himself  and his wife. This may presage a far more intense, even mystical bond with  Agni if he later chooses to enter into srauta rituals as a srautin, fire-sacrificer,

relying on the Srauta Sutras that are themselves based on the Brahmana texts  (as distinct from the Grhya Sutras covering domestic rituals). At some point in his pre-teen or early teen years his parents arrange his  marriage to a younger pre-pubescent girl, the five-day ritual vivaha creating a  union to be consummated years later when he completes his Vedic learning  and is ready to advance to the second life-stage and become a householder.  This patni, wife, selected by his family, is traditionally from another Vaidika  family with similar heritage and should be the daughter of a woman who mar ried before puberty in a five-day ritual, thus doubly assuring purity of lineage  and ritual sanction. She will be chosen from a family inside the subcaste but  outside the gotra, clan lineage from one of the ancient sages, the rsi. In some  families the bride and groom have known each other from early childhood.  Often, however, the ceremony becomes “first sight,” and when the five festive  days are over it may be years before true acquaintance begins. If the bride grew  up in a household of Vedic reciters or sacrificers she will be entirely familiar

Every day the new student will sit opposite his guru for the daily lesson.  (See Figure 2.4, a grandfather teaching a grandson, and Figure 2.5, another  grandfather teaching four grandsons at once.) Older pandits in this survey  started learning, and then eventually teaching sons, some time between 4 am 

and dawn. In recent years public school has intervened for some families and  adhyaya may not begin until dawn has broken. In any case, if successful at  memorizing passages from either the third or fourth section of the Taittiriya  Samhita the student will persevere until he has mastered all seven sections  before going on to the next three major texts of his tradition, the Taittiriya  Brahmana, Taittiriya Aranyaka, and Taittiriya Upanisad. Supplementary les 

sons will be taught from two ritual manuals preferred in Konasima that may  have been composed long ago in the Godavari Delta, one for great sacrifices,  the other for domestic rituals, respectively, the Apastamba Srauta Sutra and  Apastamba Grhya Sutra.6

Examinations and certification as a Veda pandit will follow this formal  phase of recitation that is significantly marked by a ritual bath, snana, herald ing his “return,” sama-vartana, from his guru. The boy will now be a young  man in his middle or late teens at liberty to continue textual and ritual tra ditions of his own choosing or remain under the guidance of his guru. To  appreciate the magnitude of this initial recitation achievement, traditionally a  basic education lasting eight to twelve years, printed versions in Devanagari  or Telugu script, or in English or other translation, could extend to well over  2,000 pages. One feature of this voluminous textual material, particularly true  of ritual texts, is an interweaving of essential paradigms; a student frequently  encounters passages he has already committed to memory, especially in the  transition from Samhita to Brahmana to Aranyaka. 

Several critical events await the newly certified Veda pandit. The second  asrama or stage of his life, grhastha, is that of the householder. Although  marriage with a traditional five-day ritual had already taken place when he  was about nine to sixteen years old, and the younger bride selected for him  was perhaps between seven and twelve, the role of householder, including  cohabitation and ritual consummation, is not assumed until the bride, still  living with her parents, has experienced menarche. The certified Veda pandit  and his wife may now establish residence, take embers in a fire pan (ukha)  

Vedamlo, “Living in the Veda” 35 

from the marriage fire in her parents’ home and set a domestic fire for a new  “household,” either within or outside the joint family in which he has grown  up. The couple will now make daily offerings (homa) into this single fire, the  aupasana, also called the household (grhya) or domestic (smarta) fire. A cooked  rice and ghee offering inaugurates their new contract with Agni as lord of  their residence and the couple consumes the remains.7 

The career of the married Veda pandit now follows a trajectory with mul tiple options. The Taittiriya Samhita is transmitted in several forms known as  vikrti, modifications of the “original” or model text. The student began with  the samhita, “continuous,” patha, “recitation.” After completing it he went on  with pada-patha, the same text over again broken down to separate “words,”  pada, without regard to grammatical rules that alter certain initial and final  letters when they coalesce. For a third review he receives the same text in  krama-patha, a “step-by-step” recitation. Some students do not go beyond the  first or second recitation pattern. Most young men, teenagers at this point,  stop after krama-patha with examination and certification. 

If he still has nimble brain cells, however, a student may elect to repeat much  of what he has interiorized in a far more difficult recitation, the ghana-patha,  for example, a compact braided form that is popular among gifted students in  coastal Andhra, a few of them relying on careers as ghana-pathi, masters of ghana 

who recite professionally at pandit assemblies, weddings, housewarmings, or  other auspicious occasions, often in groups of two, four, or more in antiphonal  response. The jata-patha is another difficult recitation pattern attempted briefly  by many but mastered by few. Popular among Nambudiri Brahmans in Kerala is  ratha-patha, the “chariot” recitation that has not been in style in coastal Andhra. 

On the other hand, after the chain of Taittiriya Samhita, Brahmana,  Aranyaka, and Upanisad, the gifted student may turn to one of the other Vedas,  another sakha, and begin learning some portion of the Rg Veda, for example,  with the same or a different guru. If his family includes someone with knowl 

edge of the Sama Veda, the Veda of saman, melodies in a seven-note scale, an  essential text for soma sacrifices, the student may elect to learn a segment of  that difficult text from him. There is particular pride in learning the “local”  Sama Veda since it is considered, rightly or wrongly, to be different not only  from the Jaiminiya, Kauthuma, and Ranayaniya recensions (the latter two con 

sidered by some Western scholars to be virtually the same), but also different  from versions employed by other Taittiriyins.8 

Now a young man with increasing ability, probably living with his wife  and starting a family, he may choose further studies with a pandit elsewhere  in the agrahara, or in another village or town. His options may also include  extra-Vedic texts, Mimamsa, for example, to develop his expertise in Vedartha,36 vedic voices 

inquiry into the meaning of the Veda, or another of the philosophical schools,  or Vyakarana, the study of grammar, or domestic rituals in the Smarta curricu lum. Another choice might be study of the Apastaba Dharma Sutra, consid ered to be the earliest of this genre, along with its commentaries. Certification  from any further studies will add to his credentials and increase his authority  when he attends a local or regional pandit assembly, a sabha, for debates and  exchanges of information on current Vedic events. If he becomes certified in  the Apastamba texts for domestic rituals, often a father-to-son transmission of  expertise, he may also become a family purohita, priest, for other Brahmans,  asked to conduct marriages, housewarmings, thread ceremonies for Brahman  boys, or other smarta (domestic) rites for small honoraria. 

In lineages of srauta sacrificers he might be recruited into a role as rtvij,  one of the staff of four priests necessary for fortnightly offerings known as isti on new or full-moon days and annual harvest rites, or even one of the sixteen  to eighteen priests in an extended rite such as a fire-altar construction lasting  forty days. In other words, after “graduating” from celibate studentship and  becoming a householder, the Veda pandit is engaged in post-graduate studies,  the lifelong learning that is the mark of agrahara residents who never seem  to cease their quest for knowledge. And of course “the Veda,” with hundreds  of primary, acolyte, and commentarial texts, provides unbounded territory for  exploration. 

Apastamba’s Sutras are the preferred manuals, the Grhya Sutra pertaining  to domestic rites, various life-cycle rites, for example, and the Srauta Sutra  detailing with more elaborate rituals of the three-fire system, including the  initiatory yajna (sacrifice), the offering and drinking of soma in the agni-stoma,  a ritual in praise of Agni. There are also the Sravana-pasu animal sacrifice  in July-August; the annual agrayana first-fruits sacrifice for new crops, espe 

cially rice, usually in October-November; and the building of the fire altar, the  agni-cayana, with its multiple versions that include a local favorite, the paun darika. Both Sutras are like palimpsests, the original texts layered with com mentaries, instructions, and interpretive notes that can be followed minutely  or modified in innumerable directions. Baudhayana, Hiranyakesin, and other  

Sutras are used as backups, but usually Apastamba is consulted first. One who learns some portions of the Rg Veda may also learn its Asvalayana  Sutras, and one who receives segments of the Atharva Veda may add some  of the Kausika Sutra and the Gopatha Brahmana. Some of the ahitagni lin eages cherish handwritten books of srauta instructions, particularly regard ing soma sacrifices, and these precious records are in the careful script of  great-grandfathers, grandfathers, and fathers. A concomitant result of these  familial traditions is that some rituals, both domestic (grhya) and extended 

Vedamlo, “Living in the Veda” 37 

(srauta), may have idiosyncratic versions to which guest priests from other  families must be willing to grant accommodation. 

Table  2.2 depicts the place of the Taittiriya sakha of the Krsna or Black  Yajur Veda among the other branches of Veda. It is important to keep in  mind the traditional, unchallenged belief in the Veda as unitary and eternal,

without origin; it is apauruseya, without human authorship. There is no liter ary “chronology” as in modern historical scholarship and therefore a passage  in an “early” portion of the Rg Veda that outside scholars might date to the  mid-second millennium bce is part of the same eternal text as an Upanisad  dated by text-critical scholars to be well over a thousand years later. Among  Veda pandits there is no debating this issue. Contemporary historical schol ars have perceived a distinction between a “pre-classical” Vedic period from  c. 1200 to c. 800 bce and the subsequent “classical” era that lasted several  centuries after 800. Following a survey of selected families of Veda pandits  in Chapter 3, Chapter 4, “Becoming a Veda,” provides a more nuanced dis cussion of textual learning, application of such skills, and opportunities for  the study of other Vedic and post-Vedic texts. Similarly, Chapters  5 and 6,  “Becoming a Householder,” and “Becoming Agni,” are, respectively, more rig orous pursuits of the domestic and extended ritual traditions. 

### 2 Choices for Livelihood 

The score of capsule biographies in Chapter 3 illustrates a variety of career  options for certified Veda pandits and how the scope of personal choices has  broadened over the course of four generations. Some of those who have been  recipients of cropland and houses donated by wealthy individuals who favor  the Vedic tradition have been freed from financial concerns in order to teach,  study, and in some cases perform sacrifices. As noted, some have taken up  full- or part-time professions as domestic ritualists, Smarta Brahmans, while  others recite as ghana-pathi for remuneration. Not available to the oldest of  those selected for study here but now undertaken by most Veda pandits is  the parayana system, usually called the “TTD Scheme,” borrowing an English  term applied to the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam and its program of finan cial support for Veda pandits in the form of honoraria and pensions. 

In most of the homes of Veda pandits in Konasima, a particular framed  photo, frequently garlanded, hangs on a prominent wall alongside saints and  ancestors. It is a portrait of Uppuluri Ganapati Sastri, credited with establish ing the pandits’ contractual recitation plan in the delta, a program of public  recitation, parayana, in temples large and small for two or three hours each day.  The TTD is headquartered at Tirupati in the temple complex of Venkatesvara  in the Chittor District of southern Andhra, a site now mythically famous for  seemingly incalculable wealth. From modest beginnings in 1932 during the  Madras Presidency the TTD grew through several Religious and Charitable  Endowments Acts (1951, 1969, 1979, 1987, and 2006) and the emergence of 

Vedamlo, “Living in the Veda” 39 

Andhra Pradesh as a state in 1956. Today the trust, in cooperation with the  state government, supervises a huge array of institutions, including more  than a dozen temples, associated choultries (pilgrim dormitories), hospitals,  educational enterprises, libraries, audio-recording projects (including Vedas),  and other ventures. 

Of numerous “schemes,” as they are known, the one that is of immediate  impact on the lives of Veda pandits established a schedule of monthly pay ments to qualified, that is, successfully examined pandits, who are assigned  to recite from their own sakha in designated temples. They remain unencum bered by routine activities of these temples and are entirely separate from  pujari, the priests controlling daily worship of the resident deities and distribu tion of prasada, the grace of those gods and goddesses. Rather, in the view of  TTD trustees, pandits recruited by the Devasthana promote popular apprecia tion of the Vedas as visible and audible illustrations of the living texts, even as  they serve to legitimate Vedic authority of the temples themselves. An example  is the ancient temple of Siva as Mallikarjuna and Kali as Bhramaramba on the  mountain top at Srisaila (a site mentioned in Chapter 1) as the locus of eight  Veda pandits reciting publicly, two for each Veda. 

A majority of the individuals whose lives are to be explored in the follow ing chapters signed on to this parayana program and were grateful for the  steady family income, particularly in the face of debts accrued from daughters’  marriages, divisions of properties for sons, and expenses incurred in a life  of routine or elected sacrifices. The security of a pension plan with monthly  checks after retirement from recitation duties has strong appeal. After all,  reciting in temple service simply involves a “going over” (the literal meaning  of parayana) of the same passages currently being taught to sons and grand sons. A  few, however, including two of the most prominent and regionally  famous ahitagni, insisted that the scheme was not for them and amounted  to “selling” the Veda, veda-vikriya. Furthermore, they added, it exposed their  impressionable youth to secular life with cash in hand and an inevitable spiral  of conspicuous consumption (“a motorcycle when a bicycle should do, and  so on,” muttered one elder). Both Veda and srauta suffer, they insisted, in the  environment of temple town life with its wider lens on opportunities outside  of Veda, outside of an agrahara, the proper constricted venue for Vedic life.  The TTD, in response, attempted as far as possible to assign Veda pandits to  village temples a short distance from their homes, in one case, for example,  a private agrahara shrine just a few steps out the door of an aging pandit who  had gone blind from glaucoma. A variety of opinions about the positive or  negative value of TTD salaries, special honoraria, and pension plans, as well  as central government honoraria, is cited as biographies unfold in Chapter 3.

Uppuluri Ganapati Sastri, who is listed first of all in Veda Pandits in India,  Volume 2, Veda Pandits in Andhra, was visited in Kakinada in November 1980  when he was ninety-two years old. His rail-thin frame gave no indication that  he could set mantras of great musicality reverberating through the rooms of  his modest house. He recited three Taittiriya Samhita passages concerning  the fire altar, the rope for the sacrificial animal, and the clay trampled by the  horse in the famous asva-medha sacrifice, each accompanied by explication  of context. His style is bardic, simultaneously story telling, chanting, and ser monizing. Astonishingly, some seventy-four years previous to that visit he had  been adhvaryu, executive priest, in an agni-stoma soma sacrifice in Kakinada  in 1906. 

The parayana program Uppuluri promoted in Konasima expanded over  the years. One innovation, for example, pertains to local Brahman societies  that wish to meet monthly on or close to samkramana, when the sun moves  from one rasi, sign of the zodiac, to another. The program requires a Veda  pandit to recite one of the initial forty-four panna in a long series that would  take some three years and eight months to complete. Today the rising sched 

ule of honoraria for temple recitations is common knowledge among pandits.  In 2005, for example, the salary for reciting ghana was Rs. 1,800 per month,  about 60 per day, and for those reciting krama it was Rs. 1,500 per month,  about 50 per day. Retired (vrddhi) pensioners, having concluded their temple  service, received Rs. 1,000, about 33 per day. At that time early in 2005, the  exchange rate was Rs. 43.7 for $1. As evident from the life histories told by  the older Veda pandits and their wives, such a plan of reliable income and  pension brought an extraordinary change from “the old days” prior to a cash  economy. It was an economic shift warmly welcomed by many, although for  most it never guaranteed freedom from new monetary worries that unexpect edly seemed to sprout like weeds in a crop field. 

Another economic opportunity came from the United Kingdom and the  United States after rapid construction of Hindu temples in major urban areas  there from the early 1970s to the present. London, San Francisco, New York,  Chicago, Houston, Atlanta, and many other cities sought Vaidika Brahman  pandits to do parayana in new temples, including those constructed accord 

ing to Silpa Sastras, Sanskrit manuals on architecture, and staffed by pujari who spoke the regional language, Telugu for Andhra immigrants. Salaries  were enticing and a Telugu-speaking community was assured. At one point  an invitation came to Sriramapuram agrahara from the Venkatesvara temple  in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, at the instigation of an Andhra Brahman living  there. The elders pulled out this mysterious letter written in English, heard  from the dora its contents, and flatly rejected the idea. A parayana assignment 

Vedamlo, “Living in the Veda” 41 

to Srisailem, Hyderabad, or Simhacalam, all in Andhra, was one thing.  Accepting a position in America, a land of Christian churches, strange diets,  weird customs, infinite temptations, was not for their sons or grandsons. 

In an earlier essay (Knipe 1997) that was a precursor to this book there  was agreement, regarding Konasima, with Frits Staal’s 1983 assessment  among the Nambudiri Brahmans of Kerala: Vaidika Brahmans had no inter est in coming to America. By the close of the 1990s, however, the situation  in Andhra was quite different. Information technology not only had become  well established in India but American corporations were now employing  adventurous and well-educated South Asians from coast to coast, including  sons and sons-in-law of Vaidika Brahmans. When they returned home their  reports about life in America did not match long-held opinions of those who  had never left the delta. But the conservative elders of Konasima still resisted.  No Veda-certified sons or grandsons should leave Andhra, although there was  no problem with laukika descendants taking employment in the West. Lanka  used a Telugu proverb to warn of the perils for a Veda pandit taking employ 

ment in America: “From a distance the mountains look soft.” 

### 3 The Vocabulary of an Ahitagni 

Veda pandits who have been nurtured within the embrace of srauta traditions  will be strongly encouraged to continue their heritage and become ahitagni,  sacrificers who maintain three hearths, not a single sacred fire; perform the  twice-daily heated milk offering known as agni-hotra that entitles them to be  known as rare and privileged agni-hotrin; and move on with soma sacrifice  in mind to perform the ritual known as yajna, meaning the agni-stoma. Of  the total of 626 ahitagni listed for India and Nepal by C.  G. Kashikar and  Asko Parpola, “A catalogue of ahitagnis and srauta traditions in recent times,”  nearly one-third (200) were residing in Andhra.9 The srauta ritual system, as  noted earlier, is an extended one in the sense that a simple domestic routine  has been replaced by one far more demanding on the religious energies of the  sacrificer and wife. A few may take the life-altering step into extended fires  early on, but many wait until mid-life or later. They speak repeatedly about  what is nitya, obligatory, and invariably distinguish between what is absolutely  necessary for the sacrificial life of a Vedic Brahman and what is set aside as  either kamya, a ritual for a personal desire (long life, for example, or the birth  of a son), or naimittika, a ritual that is occasional, not calendric (such as rites  for a funeral or for rain to end a drought). The last of these three categories, 

42 vedic voices 

naimittika, includes important prayascitta, expiatory performances as recom pense for failure to do the nitya rites in timely fashion.10 

To begin the life of srauta as a yajamana, a sacrificer in the more exalted reg imen of Vedic rituals, the Veda pandit with his wife as co-sacrificer must aug ment their single-fire household with its aupasana fire by performing adhana,  the nitya or obligatory ritual setting of three fires. This two-day event, usually  performed in the spring, establishes on the floor of a special room of the house  a round garha-patya, cooking fire in the west, a square ahavaniya, offering fire  to the east, and a daksina-agni, southern fire, all in three conjoined hearths of  molded clay separated from one another by a vedi storage area for the many  ritual implements necessary for any particular ritual act, a kriya or karman.  This hearth complex will be the couple’s sacred cynosure, unseen by all but the  family and ritual collaborators, until the death of one of them, at which time all  traces of it will be removed. It is Agni in the most personal sense, a living god  established solely for this house, this family, this ritual calendar. Plan 2.1, the  floor plan of Duvvuri Yajulu’s house, shows this three-fire agni-hotra room; the  house is typical for an ahitagni and patni. And see Figure 2.6, the three-hearth  complex of Bulusu Kamesvara and his wife Satyavati. 

The householder and his wife may have routinely made homa offerings into  the aupasana fire (also known as the grhya or smarta fire) at sunset and sunrise

after the agni-hotra cow is milked, the remains of the offering serving as the  beginning of the evening and morning family meals. Adding kindling sticks to  the hearth is itself an offering. This twice-daily pattern mirrors both the sandhya vandana worship that precedes agni-hotra and the vaisva-deva offerings to various  deities, the Visve Devas (All Gods) in particular. Technically, therefore, the mari tal pair may qualify as agni-hotrin with a single grhya fire, particularly if a grhya  adhana is performed. It was the personal choice of Upadhyayula Nagendram of  Amalapuram, for example, to perform agni-hotra twice daily with a single conse crated fire. The ahitagni of this survey, however, understand the srauta adhana to  be the proper prefix to agni-hotra in the ahavaniya hearth of tretagni, the three-fire  complex. Therefore, the evening-morning pattern is retained, but now it is the  garha-patya fire that heats milk to be offered into the ahavaniya fire. The couple  “sets fires” by performing adhana with five fires (Plan 2.2) that are reduced to  three (see Chapter 6 part 2). 

This routine that brackets the activities of the day will be done tens of thou sands of times in a lifetime, the recipients of the offering and mantras being  

44 vedic voices 

Agni and Prajapati in the evening, Surya and Prajapati in the morning. Always  it is the deities (devata) receiving the libation who are kept in mind. Every two  weeks there is a darsa-purna-masa new-or-full-moon offering, an isti in which  devata receiving offerings are the dual deities Agni-Soma and Indra-Agni, as  well as Agni alone and Prajapati. More elaborate than the simple agni-hotra,  food for them is pounded rice flour mixed with water into dough that is baked  in a loaf (purodasa) on terra-cotta rings in the garha-patya before presentation  to the gods. Although baked and rounded in a small lump it is not unlike the  flat steamed rice pancake with which most Andhrans begin their day, an idli for breakfast. 

First adhana and then daily agni-hotra and fortnightly isti begin a program  that may continue with other nitya (obligatory) rituals. One year after com mencing the three fires the couple is eligible to perform extended srauta rites  demanding the projection of the indoor three-fire complex out of doors onto  a broad “field of fire” (agni-ksetra) and a great altar (maha-vedi). The initiatory  rite for this leap into extended sacrifices is the agni-stoma, the first sacrifice of  soma, the sacred heavenly plant whose ritually pressed juice, provider of wis dom and immortality, is drunk by the sacrificer in the shared company of six teen rtvij priests.11 (See Plan 6.1.

projection of the three agni-hotra fires outside the house for an extended srauta ritual, drawn by Kapilavayi Venkatesvara, Simhacalam 2014. Construction of  the great altar on this field is detailed in Chapter 6, Part 7.) 

Soma is immolated and sacrificed in the company of an animal sacrifice,  pasu-bandha, in modern history, a male goat. The Indo-Iranian antiquity of  soma is assured by its correspondence to haoma in the Avesta. This pathbreak ing event, recalled with excitement by every couple for the rest of their lives,  is a five-day ritual starting on a new or full-moon day in the spring. The word  yajna is a generic term for “sacrifice,” but so important is the agni-stoma that  in coastal Andhra the two are synonymous, as in “We performed our yajna in  the year so and so,” with unmistakable reference to the first offering of soma. 

The couple undergoes an initiatory death-and-rebirth diksa consecration,  a powerful signal of this transformative moment. Infantile clenched fists and  stammering, as if learning anew to speak, are but two of several marks of  entrance into new being. Each of the couple is bound by a munja-grass belt, a  mekhala for him, a yoktra for her. Stalks of a green leafless, non-hallucinogenic  creeper (Telugu lata) that substitutes for the original soma (perhaps a species  of ephedra) are purchased from a seller who is then expelled from the agra hara. Brought in a wooden cart to a newly created ritual arena with erected  bamboo sheds and fires transferred from the domestic agni-hotra room, the  soma is welcomed as a guest (atithya) and a king (raja) with rituals befitting  a monarch. But Soma is also a god to be killed and ingested, a divine trans 

former who instills visions of light and immortality in one who drinks its  pressed juice. At one point a line of priests creeps stealthily on haunches; they  are low-lying hunters sneaking up on an antelope (a metonym for the sacri fice), each holding a shoulder of the one in front. A goat is bound to a pole and  sacrificed by suffocation. 

On the fifth day there are three pressings (savana) of soma by the adhvaryu and assistants who wield stones on the stalks against an animal hide on a board  while the requisite twelve stotra of the Sama Veda are chanted and twelve sastra of the Rg Veda are recited. The juice is filtered through wool, poured from a  tub into a pot and then into wooden cups (camasa), each carved with slightly  different markings for each priest. After first offering and then drinking soma,  the priests sacrifice a second goat and conclude the agni-stoma with a ritual  bath. In keeping with death-rebirth symbolism, the husband and wife are  renamed. As a soma-sacrificer he is now Somayaji or Soma-yajulu (in Telugu  often just Yajulu) and from now on she is never called by her given name but  rather Somi-devamma (somi-deva-amma), ending in Telugu “mother.” When  pronounced with normal Telugu rapidity her name is heard as “sodamma.”46 vedic voices 

If the couple chooses to continue with elaborate and expensive soma sacrifices beyond agni-stoma they may elect to perform one of six others in  the set of seven nitya rites, the sapta-samstha. ApSS 10.1.1 to 13.25.10 covers the  agni-stoma in great detail in four lengthy sections since it is the model for the  others. However, just as recitation patterns (patha, discussed earlier) are modi fications of the basic samhita or connected recitation of the Taittiriya Samhita,  so too there are modifications of the paradigmatic soma rite, the agni-stoma. In  shorter compass Apastamba lists the soma rituals in 14.1–16 as the ukthya, soda sin, atiratra, and aptoryama, and continues on with the remaining two of the  six modifications, 16.1 to 18.22.22, namely, the agni-cayana and the vaja-peya. 

In coastal Andhra the agni-stoma is of course prerequisite, often followed  by one of several types of agni-cayana, known by a shortened form, cayana,  each type distinguished by the number of thousands of bricks (istaka) laid  down. (See Plan 6.2, Ground plan of a syena-citi, flying eagle form of agni 

cayana.) The construction of the fire altar in five layers of bricks is a well known cosmogonic ritual in which the sacrificer is homologized to Agni as  well as the primal sacrifice person, Purusa-Prajapati, and all of time and space  are reintegrated and founded anew. Daily, as the bricks are being laid course  by course, the sacrificer carries Agni about in a fire-pan (ukha). The Satapatha  Brahmana in the Sukla or White Yajur Veda tradition devotes more than a  third of its chapters to the agni-cayana and its mysteries and is best known to  Western scholars. Konasima Brahmans, however, know only the Taittiriya ver sion. Perhaps of all Vedic rituals the agni-cayana has received the most schol arly attention, inside and outside of the tradition itself. A massive two-volume  illustrated study and a widely seen film, Altar of Fire, by Frits Staal and Robert  Gardner covered a 1975 performance by the Nambudiri Vaidika Brahmans of  Kerala.12 That rite was explained as “the world’s oldest surviving ritual” and  “perhaps” the very last performance, with no acknowledgment of centuries of  

an Andhra tradition with routine agni-cayana continuing today. Frequently it is the vaja-peya, “drink of strength,” that is a next choice  in Andhra, a sacrifice peppered with Prajapati’s sacred number seventeen.  There are seventeen each of the following:  diksa days, cups of wine (sura,  brewed from fermented rice, barley, and millet), cups of soma pressed on the  seventeenth day, “chariots” in a tame facsimile of a race, stotra chants and  sastra recitations, and of black goats sacrificed in the finale. Even the daksina,  ritual payments, must be seventeen in number although no one in modern  times gives away the female slaves, elephants, or chariots recommended by  Apastamba.13 A climactic event has the sacrificer and wife put their feet on the  first rung of a ladder braced against the sacrificial post (yupa) serving as an  axis mundi. They proclaim attainment of immortality.

Vedamlo, “Living in the Veda” 47 

Beyond the customary cayana and the vaja-peya are two ambitious soma rites, one favorite being the forty-day paundarika fire-altar layering, a sacrifice  that includes, among other components, the maha-vrata with a pretend cou pling of a brahmacarin and a prostitute. The other grandiose soma sacrifice is  the sarvato-mukha with four altars facing all compass points, requiring four  times the number of rtvij, an astonishing seventy-two priests in all. As will be  observed in the biographies, it also has been performed by a living Godavari  delta pandit. 

All of these rituals require considerable advance preparation, study of the  texts; teaching the wife her mantras and positions on the maha-vedi, the field  of sacrifice; procuring the priestly helpers, the basic four in particular—hotr,  adhvaryu, udgatr, and brahman; erecting structures on the maha-vedi; assign 

ing carpenters and potters to fashion ritual implements; hiring vanta-Brahman cooks to feed the staff and expected crowd of observers; raising funds to pay  for it all. The four major priests have three assistants each for a normal total  of sixteen, augmented for certain rites by a seventeenth, a sadasya, sometimes  even an eighteenth. All are selected by the yajamana, with the aid of an expe rienced mediator, the soma-pravaka, when plans are made for a particular  sacrifice. Great care is taken since any error reflects upon the sacrificer. “I  would be flung into papakupa (Classical Telugu, ‘the pit of Hell’) by a blunder  in mantra,” commented one pandit. Until now the ahitagni has needed only  one helper, an adhvaryu for his twice-daily agni-hotra, often a son, brother, or  other close relative or colleague living in the agrahara or village. More com monly there is even provision for assumption of the role himself (svayam).  For isti, twice-monthly offerings at new and full moons, and in the annual  harvest ritual, the agrayana, he has had to procure an adhvaryu, hotr, brahman,  and a fourth, the agnidhra, an assistant to the brahman who actually aids the  adhvaryu. Again, he has usually relied on his family or other ahitagni living  nearby, and may have taken any one of the roles himself. Apastamba provides  an escape hatch by mentioning the possibility of using only an adhvaryu and  hotr. For the animal sacrifice (pasu-bandha) in Sravana (July–August) the ahi 

tagni required the largest team, as many as six priestly helpers. The demands of soma rituals, however, exceed those limited staffs and  compel him to go outside family and village, perhaps even out of the area to  enlist sixteen or more Brahmans he trusts for the challenging roles. Often rec iprocity in the history of rituals past may determine these choices. Each of the  four major priests selected is linked to one of the four Vedas. Just as the quar tet of Vedas reveals a privileged inner trio and a “plus one” formula,14 namely,  the Atharva Veda, so does the priestly foursome break into those responsible  for the Rg, Yajur, and Sama Vedas, with a fourth who owns only a contrived 

48 vedic voices 

relationship to the Atharva Veda. These four and their assistants are listed  in Table 2.3. Some of these roles have a deep history going back four millen nia to the Indo-Iranian period as Avestan zaotar and Vedic hotr disclose. Over  the centuries Vedic priestly staffs expanded to the ideal number, sixteen, and  beyond, and several roles shifted. Sutras record the agnidhra as an assistant  to the brahman supervisor, but as kindler and maintainer of fire, as his name  indicates, he is the most important assistant of the adhvaryu, the executive  

priest. ApSS 10.1.9 lists these sixteen as shown in Table 2.3. In the study of srauta, the young Veda pandit perceives connections  between text and ritual, between sacred sound and action. He begins to  understand the positioning of all the pieces, the panna, he has been fed over  the years, and realizes that Veda is a sacrificial liturgy. If mantras are the  muscles of Veda, then kriya, ritual actions, are tendons that unite and press  them into service of the dramatic whole, the sacrifice. Recitations from the  first Veda, the Rg Veda, are known as sastra and are done by the hotr and his  three assistants. They follow stotra, chants from the third Veda, the Sama  Veda, sung by the udgatr and two of his three assistants, essentially a trio as  choir. For example, the agni-stoma, first soma sacrifice, includes a litany of  twelve sastra, each preceded by a stotra as the adhvaryu and his three assis tants become workhorses on the sacrificial ground, softly muttering verses  from their Yajur Veda correspondent to their ritual tasks. The Brahman,  fourth major priest, pronounces a few mantras and performs some actions  but remains for the most part a keen-eyed observer, a kind of ombudsman

3. udgatr, chanter of saman from the Sama Veda, with assistance from the  prastotr, prati-hartr, and su-brahmanya. 

4. brahman, overseer who knows all priestly roles and mantras, with assistance  from the brahmanac-chamsin, potr, and agnidhra. The Atharva Veda, not used in  soma rites, is assigned to the brahman for taxonomical parity. The brahman is a  

healer (bhisaj) who remains silent unless he must act to repair errors that might  damage the sacrifice.

### 4 Bonding with Agni 

Chapter 3 illustrates the ways in which these extended rituals and all their sup porting intellectual and material preparations ornament the lives of ahitagni and patni and Chapter 6 enters the ritual life in far more detail. To conclude  this chapter, however, it is instructive to review the significance of installing  the god Agni as lord of house and family, and what his presence and the obli gations of constant ritual attentions mean in the way of creating an alternative  reality. Some of this surfaces when we look at the multiple meanings of the  word agni-hotra. The god and his cult become synonymous when we see that  common parlance of ahitagni and patni employs agni-hotra to mean three sep arate entities: the daily offerings, the fires into which libations are made, and  the god Agni himself. So melded are these meanings that one nonagenarian  patni anxiously shouting “Agni-hotra! Agni-hotra!” in her final hours of breath  could have been signaling any one of the three. As Christopher Fuller has  observed of the standard Hindu worship, “Puja, at its heart, is the worshippers’  reception and entertainment of a distinguished and adored guest”15 and that  

is precisely the case with the establishment of sacred fire in the household. The fact that thousands of hours are spent addressing mantras to fires  amounts to a lifelong conversation with this elemental form of the sacred.  All know that Agni has pride of place in the Vedas: the Rg Veda, and there fore, “Veda,” begins with “Agnim ile purohitam . . .,” praise of him as visible  household priest. An entire community of deities, invited by Agni, gath ers daily with fires as cynosure and the married co-sacrificers as host and  hostess of the ritual assembly. Several ahitagni have reported what appear  to be mystical experiences, visions stimulated by prolonged engagements  with their fires and aspirations for the health and welfare of their families.16 From the student’s task of feeding the fires with kindling-stick offerings,  on through a life of agni-hotra to the final oblation, one’s own body given to  tretagni—ahavaniya, daksinagni, and garha-patya, igniting head, arms, and  midsection before burning together as one—devotion to Agni has no paral lel in the religious experience of the ahitagni. That ultimate manifestation of  the deity, the awe-inspiring and beloved god who absorbs, is Agni kravyad,  flesh-eating Agni. 

A potent aspect of the cult of Agni is the seminal notion of purity (sauca)  and impurity (asauca). Maintaining the purity of ritual fires and special areas 

50 vedic voices 

that are out of bounds for laity is a hallmark of Vedic ritualism. In South Asia,  Vedic Brahmans are not alone in this regard. Parsis are the remnant custodi ans in India of the once-powerful Zoroastrian imperial religion of Achaemenid  Persia. Today their priests in Mumbai and elsewhere in India still wear white  masks to avoid defiling the sacred fire. Lay Parsis, whose home altars burn  incense as a form of domestic ritual fire, may not approach the temple fire.  Their Vedic cousins, also descendants of third-millennium-bce Indo-Iranian  cults of fire and the sacred plant *sauma17 are equally concerned with pro tecting sacred fires from impurity. A significant difference, however, is that  Zoroastrian tradition long ago turned to their famous Towers of Silence and  birds of prey for disposal of the dead in order to avoid defiling fire with the pol lution of death, whereas Vedic tradition retained an identification of sacrificer  and fire, including final absorption by Agni via cremation. 

To take just two examples of fire protection from Vedic practice, consider  the necessity of setting fires, adhana, and undergoing ritual consecration prior  to a soma sacrifice, the diksa. The reason given by many qualified Veda pandits  for not performing adhana, or rekindling if there has been a lapse, is the lack  of personal space, a house exclusively of one’s own. What this means, when  pressed for details, is that living in an apartment building or shared house  means inability to control the transit of those who may be impure, quite spe 

cifically, menstruating women.18 As for diksa, before performing agni-stoma or  any later soma ritual both the sacrificer husband and co-sacrificer wife undergo  a ritual equivalent of death and rebirth. This consecration of the couple pro vides access to the maha-vedi arena of sacrifice and renders them impervious  to ritual pollutions until the concluding bath, including death pollution in the  family or the onset of menses for the wife. If she menstruates, and consider ing that the paundarika is forty days in length she will do so if she has not  reached menopause, there is no need for her to leave the sacrificial ground. All  participants will be careful not to touch her as she goes on with her duties in  a secluded corner, the patni-sala, but the ritual theoretically remains undam aged thanks to the protective canopy of diksa. 

To return to the homology of sacrificers and fires, it is the case that the  agni-hotra room of the house is an area set apart from profane time and space,  just like the diksa-shielded home owners during extended rites. In fact, the  three fires (tretagni) represent a cosmos—earth, midspace, and heaven—in  a triadic symbolism as old as the first Veda. In Rg Veda 5.11.2 Agni is estab 

lished on his “triple seat,” the three altars. When a srauta ritual is scheduled,  this threefold microcosm is projected out of the house to the east to form a  macrocosmic world, a great field of fire (agni-ksetra). In the case of the several  forms of agni-cayana this ritual work founds a new world, its east-west and 

Vedamlo, “Living in the Veda” 51 

north-south axes and triple representation of Agni entirely a magnification  of the agni-hotra room. Agni is still there as priest while the deities arrive and  depart. Offerings are still transformed by Agni and serve as constant agents of  communication and connection. 

Another powerful statement of the bond between sacrificers and fires  concerns the pair of fire-kindling woods (arani) kept safely wrapped  together by every ahitagni and patni. The rectangular lower block is placed  firmly on the ground and a small hole in it receives the tip of the upper  wood that is twirled rapidly on a connecting spindle until friction causes  dry straw and sawdust to ignite. Figure 2.7 illustrates this churning of  fire (agni-manthana). The act, a procreative one involving an upper male  arani and lower female arani, requires two people, one standing to hold the  grooved spindle in place, the other to sit and twirl it by pulling a cord back  and forth in the grooves. Unless a guest rtvij is involved (as in the photo)  the pair is, appropriately enough, husband and wife generating Agni. The  arani are special wood from an asvattha tree, Ficus religiosa, found rooted  in a crevice of a sami tree, Mimosa suma, and is prized for its hardness.  In the case of transferring fire to another location there are mantras and  mystical procedures to draw ghee-activated fire into the two arani after they  are warmed over the garha-patya. A  reverse procedure releases fire from

the arani onto kindling materials elsewhere. Alternatively, so tight is the  Agni-sacrificer connection that fires may be mystically drawn up into the  body of the sacrificer for the same ends. Thus in rare instances of traveling  away from home, the sacrificer may take fires in three separate terra-cotta  pots slung from cords, each carefully labeled garhaptaya, daksinagni, aha 

vaniya, or take only the arani, or last, assume them into his body.19 Just as Chapter 4, “Becoming a Veda,” expands further on textual learning  and application, so Chapter 6, “Becoming Agni,” delves further into ritual  life, both chapters drawing upon illustrations from the lives of Veda pandits  presented in Chapter 3. In between, Chapter 5, “Becoming a Householder,”  addresses, among other concerns, the samskara, life-cycle rituals, including  the funereal final passage. Chapter 6 provides a more detailed examination  of adhana in which a symbolic five-fire arena is first established before it is  reduced to a standard three. 

### 5 The Voices of Ahitagni and Other  

Veda Pandits 

In the next chapter, ten families are portrayed in capsule biographies of ahi tagni or other exemplary Veda pandits. Most of these families are now or were  for their productive years located in agrahara or agrahara-like villages in or  near Konasima. All families have multigenerational connections to Konasima  through marriage and other ritual activities, although one is established across  the Vasistha-Godavari in West Godavari District and another is split between  two pilgrimage temple towns. Pillars of these ten families include seven ahi 

tagni and a smaller number of eligible and aspirant ahitagni. All of those dis cussed here are well known to Veda pandit society of coastal Andhra and some  have the distinction of all-India honors in recognition of their achievements. 

By the late 1980s the golden age of srauta activity in Konasima had passed.  In continuing interviews for this book, a crucial research decision was made  to remain in Konasima rather than jump to Krishna District more than a hun dred miles by road to the west where the Dendukuris, Visnubhatlas, and other  families appeared to maintain active srauta lives. Guntur and Nellore Districts  were other possibilities. This resolution was based on several events. One was  an initial attempt in November 1980 to observe a srauta ritual in Vijayawada,  the major city in Krishna District. The sacrifice was mentioned in Konasima  by Lanka Venkatarama Sastri who had a rtvij role ongoing for a number of  days. After traveling there alone by train, walking to the suburban site, finding  that Lanka was not there at the time, and then being asked by the sacrificer  to leave, there was nothing to do but conduct an embarrassed retreat. The 

Vedamlo, “Living in the Veda” 53 

full and somewhat bizarre story did not emerge until some time later. Three  years earlier the young American scholar Harold Arnold (the only one ever  known to visit coastal Andhra) went to nearby Jujjuru to witness a soma sacri fice. While he sat observing the paundarika, the bamboo and straw mat sadas caught fire; he was labeled the cause of damage to the ritual and told to leave.  Many years later the ahitagni Lanka mentioned this catastrophe caused by a  dora and said mischievously “Was that you?”20 

A second reason for remaining with the known pandits of Konasima  resulted from a more fruitful but disconcerting revisit to Vijayawada, this time  into the graciously accepting home of the Dendukuri ahitagni family. They  were forthcoming with some details about their teaching and ritual lives, but  mostly the occasion degenerated into a sales pitch and an opportunity to press  for money that quickly became distasteful. Perhaps the negative reaction was  due to long experience with Baballa, Lanka, Duvvuri Yajulu, Mitranarayana,  and other Konasima ahitagni shunning of veda-vikriya, the selling of Veda, the  undermining effect of associating religion and economic gain. And of course  an additional reason for adherence to Konasima was a deepening affection for  the Veda pandit families there and a conviction that their many robust voices  deserved wider recognition. This is the subject of the next chapter.

A Selection of Ahitagni and Other Veda Pandits in Agrahara,  Villages, and Towns 

### 1 The Sriramapuram Agrahara 

In an exploration of Veda pandit lives, diverse personalities and family his tories become visible, each dense with narratives regarding pursuit of the  twin goals: the absorption of Veda and the flowering of a chosen ritual life.  The former contains the laborious joy of paying back the debt owed for that  privilege by teaching sons, grandsons, younger brothers, and often those  outside the immediate family. And each pandit portrays a special ritual past  and hopeful future. Within every representation a wife figures creatively  as helpmeet, maternal presence, and co-sacrificer. Then it is all the chil dren, with special attention to Veda-trained sons, who enter narratives at  every opportunity. Along with all the expected or unanticipated outlines,  however, comes a variety of insights into life in India during the rapidly  changing decades of the turn of the millennium, the 1980s, 1990s, and  beyond the initial 2000 decade. An expanding economy with a cash basis,  a burgeoning middle class, affirmative action for the lower classes, changes  in transportation, new forms of communication including TV, then color  TV and DVDs, cell phones, computers, motor vehicles. At the same time  there are carry-overs of the old ways, for example, the delight of success 

fully arranged marriages and the agony of the dowry system that cripples  financial and emotional well-being. This chapter allows the voices of a wide  range of Vedic personalities to be heard. 

The accomplishments of the pandits selected here are manifold; most are  well respected in South India, one being famous in Vaidika circles throughout

India. And yet there is a striking lack of pretension in their statements, a mod esty that flies in the face of their extraordinary achievements. Ethnographically  speaking, their biographies are precious for they have largely escaped the atten tion of journalists and scholars alike, living in remote enclaves through the  busy changing of the millennia that paid attention to the fading of the British  Raj, two great wars followed by successive internecine wars in South Asia, and  decades of political struggles within India itself, all widescreen panoramas with  little note of a religious tradition that has lasted, by outside historical reckon 

ing, over 3,700 years, and is by inside traditional accounting anadi, eternal. Selected here are ahitagni and other Veda pandits, together with some  wives and children, to illustrate the activities of Veda and srauta in the delta  throughout the twentieth and into the current century. In many ways their life  histories are extraordinary to non-Vaidika South Asian contemporaries in New  Delhi, Nagpur, or Bangalore, not to mention contemporaries in Los Angeles,  Paris, or Shanghai, for whom their daily activities are entirely unimaginable.  In their own eyes they have led quite ordinary, if secluded and highly disci plined, existences. Their careers should be noted and “attention should be  paid,” especially to the old generation that is now almost entirely gone. Even  for those families who continue a healthy transmission of Veda, if not srauta,  there is a difference. A Veda pandit and patni of the present are not the same  Vaidika presence as their grandparents of the early twentieth century, and  clarifying this distinction is one of several aims of this study. Presented in this chapter are glimpses of life in two agrahara, Sriramapuram  and Nedunuru; two villages, Vyaghresvaram and Iragavaram; a city, Kakinada;  and two small temple towns, Annavaram and Simhacalam. Such a broad spec trum allows the unity as well as the surprising diversity of Veda pandit life to  shine through the changes of the period under study. The following individu als speak for the most part in their own words collected over a period of three  and a half decades. Their lives unfold here not as precise historical biogra phies but rather as illustrations of one or another aspect of the Vedic tradi tion, as personifications of the routines, daily dramas, rigors, and aspirations  of individuals, families, and small communities vedam-lo, “existing in Veda.”  Their voices will be heard briefly, with many lacunae, some oddities, some in  more detail on certain subjects than others, as they provide glimpses of the  changing scene of twentieth- and twenty-first century Vedic life. This chapter provides more of the historical and textual details of Veda and  srauta, as well as some specific highlights of agrahara life. The backdrop for these  capsule biographies is intended to give them the brightness of life and author ity. Even a small agrahara such as Sriramapuram, for example, harbored dis parate sets of Brahman families during the course of this study, each governed56 vedic voices 

by special sensitivities to rank, time, space, and ritual proclivities. There was  an established hierarchy, with unpublished but careful ranks within the hier archy: on a short lane with all families living within sight of one another there  were ahitagni, other Veda pandits with differing degrees of accomplishment,  and secular Brahmans. The ahitagni, at the top of the pecking order, included  nitya agni-hotrin with active fires and twice-daily agni-hotra, but also those who  because of physical incapacity allowed fires to lapse temporarily until the oppor tunity to rekindle. There were living pairs, invariably in declining years, whose  fires permanently expired, and finally, ahitagni and patni widowers and widows  whose hearths were erased after the death of the spouse, their srauta ritual lives  

then concluded (see Figure 0.6, Sriramapuram agrahara in 1987). At the time of the first visit there were three families of ahitagni and patni living in Sriramapuram. When fires are active, the ahitagni and patni are  bound in space to the threefold hearth and bound in time to performance of  two or three baths daily, two sandhya-vandana daily, two agni-hotra daily, two  isti monthly, and one agrayana annually. They have special relationships to  Agni, Candra, anna, and Soma for those approaching or beyond agni-stoma.  Those whose fires have lapsed may do mantra portions of agni-hotra without  kriya, routine baths or “sponge baths” if unable to manage the river or canal,  sandhya-vandana twice daily, and possible participation in agrayana. Widows  are bound to the house; widowers are not. Teaching Veda pandits who are  an-ahitagni, not ahitagni, are theoretically bound to the house for specified  times of adhyapana and scheduled times for parayana if employed. For some,  the two duties are combined while others may perform elsewhere since they  are not bound in space or time to fires other than smartagni, the grhya fire, and  personal programs of household worship. Finally, the majority of the families  in the agrahara are laukika Brahmans with their own schedules of secular  activities, including accountants, schoolteachers, and retirees. Except for per sonal vows and devotions, it is only the widows who have ritual restrictions. The survey begins with Baballa, senior ahitagni during the early years of visits  and a Veda-bhasya scholar beloved throughout the delta. (See Figure 3.1, Baballa  and Sundari, Sriramapuram, 1987, and Figure 3.2, Baballa, age eighty-eight,  Sriramapuram 1991.)

a role in a great srauta ritual, and stayed in the house for some days while  all the preparations were underway, he—or perhaps she, no one was sure— became the target of everyone’s affection. Baballa, sacrificer-to-be, found him  irresistible and admired him daily. “For the ritual of placement we dug a hole,  lined it with shells, let some honey drip onto his shell and placed him looking  at the hole. Face to face with him I recited: ‘You are not required here, you are  free to go.’ The altar bricks for the aruna-ketuka were laid in place above him.  Next morning he was gone. He found the way out.” 

Bhamidipati Yajnesvara Somayaji, Srivatsa gotra, whose affectionate sobri quet “Baballa” is known all along coastal Andhra, is a good selection to begin this  survey of recent and contemporary Veda pandits. Born in 1903, his life stretched  across all but ten years of the twentieth century. And it was on the arugu, the  open-air front steps of his house that most interviews in Sriramapuram were  held, even for years after his death a few months short of his ninetieth birth day. His lineage was one of the most ahitagni-prolific families in nineteenth and twentieth-century India. Baballa traced his ancestry back to the eighteenth  century and the mula-purusa, root ancestor, Bhamidipati Brahmibuta Acarya.  Brahmibuta became a samnyasin, a renouncer-ascetic, but not before pro ducing a lineage that would become extraordinarily famous by any stan dard: Virabhadra Somayaji, Acchuta Rama Somayajulu, Yajnesvara Somayajulu,  Chinna Subrahmanya Somayajulu, in that order of paternal ancestors, the last  being Baballa’s father. Baballa’s mother was Kamesvara of the Akella Veda pan dit family. This fifth-generation union created a sixth generation, six sons who  all became ahitagni. Five became soma sacrificers, including Baballa, and the  sixth very nearly joined them but died when his agni-stoma was in its planning  stages. In the last few centuries, few if any families in India or Nepal have ever  had six brothers performing agni-hotra at one time. 

Baballa’s astonishing lineage crashed abruptly when his only son,  Subrahmanya Somayaji, with the nickname “Bullebbayi,” suffered multiple  congenital ailments and could not become an eligible Veda pandit. Neighbors,  softly describing his disabilities, including lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis,  a painful disase that also infected his mother, Sundari), called him “some 

what innocent.” A  further blow was the death of his only daughter at the  age of twenty days, a sad event never mentioned by Baballa. Bullebbayi had  two sons—one, Somasekhara, given away in adoption to Baballa’s younger  brother; the other, Yajnesvara Prasad, producing three beautiful daughters but  no son. The three girls are today the ninth generation of direct descendants of  Brahmibuta, the eighteenth-century samnyasin. 

Yajnesvara Prasad, a schoolteacher, and his wife Laksmi continue to live in  the house at the head of the lane that has always been recognized as principal

residence of the agrahara, the one that welcomes visitors. Table 3.1 is a simpli fied sketch of the Bhamidipati genealogy. All of these names are here pared  down to essentials. For example, the full name of his grandson, born in 1961,  that Baballa recited was Yajnesvara Venkata Satya Surya Rama Subrahmanya  Somayaji. His was the seventh generation in a row to carry the hopeful hon orific Soma-yaji, soma-sacrificer, and the second in succession to have that  acclimation unrealized. It might be noted here that in marriages to boys who  eventually become soma sacrificers, girls are known by personal names only  until marriage. After that life-changing event no personal or family name is a  

referent, only the female equivalent of Soma-yaji, Somi-devamma. Although born in Mukkamala, Baballa was raised in the nearby village of  Irusumanda in the home of his maternal uncle, Akella Subha Avadhani, father  of Sundari, Baballa’s future bride, six years his junior. As youngsters they both  attended the school in Irusumanda, Baballa to fourth class, when he could  read and write Telugu by the age of nine, and Sundari to third class. When  Sundari was twelve and Baballa eighteen, their five-day wedding took place as  a menarika (cross-cousin) marriage, one that lasted for seventy-one years. They  lived first in Mukkamala, then in Sriramapuram. 

Baballa’s father, famous for teaching many students, was guru not only  for Baballa and his five brothers but also for the second Sriramapuram ahi tagni featured in this survey, Duvvuri Yajulu. At that time there were as many  

60 vedic voices 

as twenty local students of Veda pandits in Mukkamala, with others arriving  from surrounding villages, some by sailboats gliding silently along the river  channels, or smaller craft poled through canals, or punt ferries pulled by rope  to connect one dirt track with another. Before there were metalled all-weather  roads and eventual bus services it was faster to travel by water, usually with  no more cost than hitching a ride on a bullock cart or horse tonga. Duvvuri  Yajulu, arriving from Kapilesvarapuram, remembered Baballa’s father being  so deeply lost in reciting the Vedic text of the day that “we students would  sneak away on calls of nature and he never noticed we were gone!” 

Once he had completed the eighty-two pannas, Baballa’s energies went  into three enterprises:  supervision of those crop fields in Gangalakurru he  was eventually to inherit, the teaching of Veda to selected students, and con tinuous browsing into texts beyond the Taittiriya sakha he had mastered. His  quest for knowledge was a lifelong pursuit, in Veda, srauta, Dharma-sastra,  Mimamsa, Vedanta, Jyotisa, Vyakarana, and other genres. His hunger for the  association of ideas never diminished. After our first unannounced encounter  in October 1980, when he had been surprised at noon in the midst of textual  studies, he said with genuine excitement and a sparkle in his eyes, “I was  looking into exactly these subjects you suddenly came to inquire about!” He  allowed that initial visit to blossom into an auspiciously destined event. For  the second visit the greeting was as warm as for old and dear friends. Even  in his latest years, with each visit an almost completely deaf Baballa would be  discovered squinting at a book or palm-leaf manuscript held only inches from  his glasses. And never did he lose his impish sense of humor. 

Baballa thanked his father for providing him a life free from economic  worries. “We were very fond of each other. He was a strict disciplinarian,  tough on me. But he took care of everything, made sure I could give undivided  attention to learning. I enjoyed that luxury and remember a youth as comfort 

able as swinging in a cradle.” As to teaching, Baballa took on fewer students  than his father but was known for dedication to those he accepted. At the  height of his textual reciting career he had four students living in his house  continuously learning Veda. He was the exclusive guru for grandson Prasad  who learned all eighty-two panna from him during 1971 to 1980. Although  he did not appear for his examination by the Parishad, Prasad, who became  a schoolteacher in a nearby village in 1986, remembers going to the fields  every day in his grandfather’s footsteps, accompanied by one or another fel low student—Chirravuri Ramam, Sripada Manikya, Prabhala Krishnamurti,  Samavedam Narayana (discussed later), and others who became Veda pandits  well known throughout Konasima and other parts of Andhra. They would sit  beside the rice paddy or under coconut palms for adhyaya and Baballa would 

A Selection of Ahitagni and Other Veda Pandits 61 

take breaks from time to time to check on the field hands. Then they would  return to the village for lunch and a review of the morning recitation. Baballa  remained a hands-on “gentleman farmer” all his life until finally turning over  supervision of the fields to Prasad at the close of the 1990s. 

3.1.1.2 Examining Students 

Perhaps it was the strict standards required by Baballa that intimidated his  grandson-student and made Prasad nervous about appearing before the  Parishad examiners. In the 1950s Baballa and his Veda pandit colleagues raised  donations and established a trust fund to conduct an examination system for  various genres of Vedic and Sanskrit learning, including Veda and srauta, first  and foremost, but also smarta, apara, Agamas, Mimamsa, Vyakarana, and  other subjects, with assemblies convened in Amalapuram, Rajahmundry, or  various East Godavari District villages every year. In Vaisakha month 1987, for  example, the village of Vyaghresvaram volunteered to be host and examina tions were held for thirty students in Veda, four in smarta, and one in Agama,  each of them assessed after eight to twelve years of study. Examinations in  different texts and recitation patterns took place over a period of two days with  the afternoon of the second day spent honoring successful students and estab 

lished scholars. “For encouragement” each student who passed was given  between Rs. 150 and 200 (about $3.75 to $5). 

3.1.1.3 Fulfillment in Srauta 

Baballa was well into his middle age, after many years’ study of srauta and  reflection on the family heritage with its multiple generations of ahitagni,  before he seriously considered setting the fires. Nudges came from numerous  colleagues and relatives. “As well as one’s own commitment,” he noted, “one  needs confirmation from professional colleagues and the moral support of  outsiders. Until I was openly prodded I did not have the courage to do it.” He  performed adhana, a ritual establishment of the three fires for daily agni-hotra,  in 1959 at the age of fifty-five. Six months later came his agni-stoma, first soma sacrifice, known throughout Konasima as yajna. Lanka Venkatarama Sastri,  his friend and highly respected Veda pandit neighbor a half hour’s walk away  in Nedunuru, was adhvaryu, executive priest. Lanka was himself preparing for  his own agni-stoma. 

Baballa’s yajna initiated an intense period of srauta and other rituals that  was to last five years, as if the sheer weight of his lineage had suddenly ener gized him. “I wanted to accomplish without fail all the rituals performed by all  my ancestors.” After agni-stoma came the sravana pasu animal sacrifice in the 

62 vedic voices 

month of Sravana. In Bhadrapada month 1960 he performed aruna-ketuka,  the construction of a fire altar composed of symbolic “bricks” in the form of  water offerings. This sacrifice with his pet tortoise he always described as his  favorite and one that both his father and father’s older brother had done. For  this he did madhu-kara for twelve days, a symbolic year of begging for food  from house to house as if he had been returned to his youthful brahmacarin days. The catur-masya, four-monthly sacrifices, were also fulfilled, as was the  ritual of the new rice harvest, the agrayana, a performance that Baballa and  Sundari were to manage in Phalguna month every year through 1990 when  he was eighty-seven and she was eighty-one. In 1991, when both were frail and  quite deaf, it was regretfully omitted from their ritual schedule for the first  time. By then it had been the pattern for some years to allow the agni-hotra fires to lapse and then be rekindled for twice-daily offerings and two lunar isti 

bracketing the agrayana, a procedure detailed in Chapter 6. It is not surprising that Baballa also embarked upon lengthy rituals known  as naksatra or pavitra offerings (isti). Throughout Andhra, people suffering  misfortunes have recourse to temples housing shrines of the nava-graha, the  nine planets. If Sani (Saturn), for example, appears in a horoscope, his temple  in Mandapalli, within walking distance of Sriramapuram, is the place for most  people—Hindus, Muslims, and Christians included—to transfer Sani’s dosa, evil effect, onto a Siva linga or onto a special Brahman ritualist who has the  temerity to unload it from himself. Baballa did not go to Mandapalli or wor ship nava-graha elsewhere. Vaidika Brahmans have older, and in their eyes  more powerful, resources in offerings to twenty-eight naksatra, constellations  or “star markers.” The naksatra isti, some forty days in duration, was among  other substantial rituals accomplished by Baballa in that energetic period in  Mukkamala before and after 1960. 

His colorful descriptions of details brought them to life. “The yajamana must not touch the bricks of the cayana without first undergoing diksa.  Otherwise he will be burned by Agni like an electrician touching a hot wire  without gloves.” And with regard to his agni-stoma: “Putting soma into the fire  makes one a soma-yaji, and then one travels in a well-grooved path, like a cart  moving easily along a track, not like one on an untrodden field.” 

3.1.1.4 The Move to Sriramapuram 

In 1962 Baballa and Sundari were granted a small plot in Sriramapuram across  the Billakurru Canal and westward a few hundred yards, almost within hail ing distance of the old house. They spent their entire lives within sight of this  stream that Baballa, a believer in the Sapta-Godavari mental map, endowed 

A Selection of Ahitagni and Other Veda Pandits 63 

with the name Kausika, that is, the great rsi Visvamitra. The donation included  money to build a house with an agni-hotra room and an acre of cropland with  an assured yield of fifteen bags of paddy, unhusked rice. Because of their  reputation as open-armed host and hostess for ahitagni and other Veda pan 

dits, they were given the roadside plot facing the lane, the better to welcome  guests immediately on arrival. Since ahitagni may safely take food and drink  only from the kitchen of the wife of another ahitagni, their house became the  natural stopover for those participating in sabha (assemblies) in Mukkamala,  Sriramapuram, or sometimes Vyaghresvaram.1 

As mentioned in Chapter 2, the Tirupati-Tirumalai Devasthanam (TTD),  the administrative body of the famous temple of Venkatesvara, in coopera tion with the Department of Religious Endowments of the state government  of Andhra Pradesh, made a major commitment to underwrite Veda teach ing, srauta ritual, and a heightened public awareness of Vedic tradition. Their  projects transformed the lives of Veda pandits in much of South India. With  enormous wealth and extensive power in India not unlike that of the Vatican  in Rome, the TTD distributes to Veda pandits monthly stipends, pensions,  and honoraria and employs them for daily parayana (recitation) in temples,  not to be heard and repeated by students, but rather to be heard formally by  honored resident deities and informally by worshippers passing through. This  belongs, of course, to a modern tradition in which public hearing of the sacro sanct Veda became open to the non-twice-born communities. 

When invited repeatedly by the TTD to take on a parayana position, or at  least accept an honorarium, Baballa bellowed his response: “Not for ahitagni!”  To take remuneration of any kind, he argued, would be veda-vikraya, the sell ing of the Veda, an atrocious sin. He was aparigraha, not taking honoraria,  dana, gifts. But the TTD enrolled him in its pension plan anyway and also  extended its largesse to his unemployable son. Baballa’s fierce independence  regarding things monetary extended to the interview situation as well, for  which he would never accept an honorarium. If a traditional silk or wool shawl  was presented to him he would laugh aloud and say “Oh, this must be for (the  god) Dattatreya!” and give it to someone else. 

Perhaps more than any other Veda pandit Baballa expressed affection for  the local people and an awareness of their beliefs. At one time, out of interest  in the fourteenth-century Advaita scholar, Vidyaranya, author of the Pancadasi  and other works in the school of Sankara, he thought of establishing a shrine  by the bathing platform on the Kausika, just across the road from his house,  accessible to all for japa but not inside the agrahara. Then he became aware  that not many knew about Vidyaranya. On the other hand, Dattatreya, son  of the great rsi Atri, was quite popular. Baballa did not give credence to local 

64 vedic voices 

folklore that a living incarnation of Dattatreya resided not far away in the  Sripada family, but he thought the original god, the amalgamation of Brahma,  Visnu, and Siva, deserved a home near the agrahara. “All three will be here and  people belonging to any of them can worship together.” When it was pointed  out that Dattatreya is not a Vedic god he broke into his one-tooth grin, “Ah,  yes, but Visnu is in the garhapatya, Siva in the daksinagni, and Brahma in the  ahavaniya,” knowing full well that the local folk knew nothing of these terms  and had never seen his agni-hotra room. A  donor was located and in 1987  the little Dattatreya shrine was founded with mantras and homa into a newly  rope-churned fire. Baballa also wished to acquire land in order to plant aus picious trees, the marri, medi, ravi, and vepa, in particular, so that folk in the  region could come and worship them and thereby acquire boons. 

Baballa was a special person, an independent rustic, witty, good-humored,  and earthy. He was always modest, fair-minded, not at all intimidating or  threatening yet clearly most senior of the local pandits, even when nearly stone  deaf. In America he would be known as a cracker-barrel philosopher, a source  of down-home wisdom laced with wisecracks and folklore. A senior colleague  described him as a maha-purusa (great human) who always replied from  knowledge and experience and never hesitated to respond to a query: “Anyone  who came to him, young or old, Brahman or Pancama (Scheduled Caste),  received his blessing. In my long experience he was always there for others,  never self-preoccupied.” 

Visits to Sriramapuram were occasions for the Veda pandits to gather on  Baballa’s arugu, sometimes even interrupting teaching sessions. They quickly  became mini-sabha of vigorous debate on every conceivable subject, Baballa  acting as moderator-sage, providing balance and well-rounded discussion,  pulling others back from confrontational remarks or the occasional wild the 

ory. For example, disparaging comments on Scheduled Caste encroachment  or Christian baptisms in the sacred river would be truncated by Baballa as  senior scholar: “Hmm, yes, I know about that, but . . .” and the original topic  would come back into focus. Baballa was ahead of his time in accomodating  cheerfully to the new multiculturalism of Indian society and he had a knack  for countering discrimination with softly stated reason and tolerance. 

In the eyes of the visitor from abroad Baballa was a precious and invalu able link to an age that has virtually disappeared. It was not only that he spoke  from the old chronology (“I was born in the year krodhi on the fourth of the  bright half of Margasirsa-masa and I was married in the year dundubhi in the  bright half of Jyestha-masa  .  .  .”). It was his stubborn resistance to certain  changes that allowed him to perpetuate a measure of the nineteenth-century  traditionalism of his father and other gurus. Stolidly ensconced in the ritual 

A Selection of Ahitagni and Other Veda Pandits 65 

and dharma of the old school, he was less amenable than others to accom modate to some modern ways. At the same time, his mulishness extended to  certain normative srauta procedures. For one, he steadfastly refused priestly  roles in the srauta rituals of others. Only once did he deviate from that vow  and that was in reciprocity for his own earlier yajna conducted by Lanka. In  Lanka’s agni-stoma he accepted the minor sadasya role, the seventeenth priest  who assists the brahman. 

Several justifications were offered regarding his refusals to participate as a  ritualist. First, he was guided by his aparigraha stance of “non-acceptance” of  gratuities for anything connected with Veda. Just as he never accepted daksina from a student for adhyapana so he could not acquire the cash daksina a rtvij necessarily receives from the sacrificer in order to complete the ritual. Both  would be, as Baballa construed it, Veda for sale. Accepting a donation of land  and house was one thing, money for reciting Veda or performing srauta quite  another. 

But also he refused rtvij roles because of specific apprehensions, the  dreaded negative consequences from performing alongside inadequately  trained younger colleagues. Like many senior Veda pandits he was alarmed  at lapses in traditional teaching methods, relaxed examination standards, and  innovations such as the use of printed books for students to review by reading  what had been learned guru-mukha, from the mouth of the guru. He feared  imprecision in the kriya (ritual acts) employing mantras imperfectly interior 

ized, since the results of those kriya could inflict personal as well as cosmic  damage. Therefore he was reluctant to join a company of rtvij whose training,  credentials, and moral integrity were not entirely known to him. On several  occasions he spoke about the dangers of soma-bhaksana, drinking soma, in the  company of unfamiliar pandits. Times had changed since his childhood when  the accomplished Bhamidipati family alone could supply the eighteen rtvij necessary for an agni-stoma, if not all seventy-two for a sarvato-mukha. 

In part, Baballa’s disavowal was simple concern over the recent lack of  obeisance to patterns of the old school. “What kind of Brahman is he whose  upanayana was completed in one hour (instead of the traditional four or five  days)?” he would inquire of the long shadow of a coconut palm. But perhaps  more important was the thought of dark consequences born out of experience  and the instruction of elders such as his ahitagni guru Bulusu Somayajulu.  “Just as a person who does not know precisely how to perform abhicara (the  use of mantras in spells) can be killed by it, so the consequences can be  extremely dangerous from improper sacrifice of animals. Animal sacrifice is  not the simple matter its critics and the common people say.”66 vedic voices 

The awe with which he regarded “ritually precarious situations,” his phrase  for the pasu-bandha, was matched on a different track by mystical experiences  during agni-hotra. Just as he was one of the few to speak casually and without  affectation of the hazardous practices of abhicara, so was Baballa a rare win 

dow into the transformative spiritual side of a ritual life. In choppy, emotion ally charged phrases, hands gesturing to animate the inexpressible, he would  at times confide details of certain wondrous moments of great impact. “One  day while performing agni-hotra something very special happened, something  luminous, with brilliance (tejassu), arose from the homa and appeared before  my eyes. Then my daughter-in-law conceived and was blessed with a male  child.” At another time while offering into the ahavaniya fire “a four-armed  figure (catur-bujudu) appeared. Why? I tried to imagine! Well, a second grand son was on the way!” 

3.1.1.5 A Funeral to Remember 

These emotional revelations out of mystical contexts of Agni, his refusal of dak sina as guru, rtvij, or TTD “employee,” his fear of drinking soma in the wrong  company, all mark Baballa a member of an older stratum of the Vaidika elite  that is scarcely present today. “After Baballa,” said Samavedam, his next-door  neighbor for over three decades, “there is no other.” Baballa broke his hip in  a fall June 1, 1993, and lay dying on darbha grass on a cot, another cot nearby  holding his only son dying of cancer. Baballa, fully conscious, longed for his  antyesti, the “last sacrifice” of his body to be first so that Bullebbayi could per 

form sraddha to advance him into a proper and orderly rebirth after a sojourn  with his father and earlier ancestors. He received his wish and died at 10 am on August 6, less than six months before the death of his sixty-four-year-old  son on New Year’s Day 1994. 

Being an ahitagni, the brahma-medha funeral was requisite, a special  three-hour cremation via the three agni-hotra fires along with all ritual imple ments save those used in re-burning the pulverized bones in another spe cial rite for soma sacrificers, the punar-dahana. Both of these funeral rites are  described at the end of Chapter 6, along with losta-citi, a replication of the  agni-cayana fire altar on the spot of cremeation. For some younger members  of Vedic families living in Sriramapuram, Nedunuru, and Vyaghresvaram,  this was the first brahma-medha they had witnessed, but later in the same  decade more were to follow as local ahitagni couples were reduced: Duvvuri  Yajulu’s wife, Surya, and Pullela’s wife, Kamesvari, in 1996, Bulusu Cayanulu  in 1997, Lanka in 1999.

A Selection of Ahitagni and Other Veda Pandits 67 

The day of death and beginning of asauca, ritual impurity, are reckoned  not from the moment of biological death of an ahitagni, but rather from the  occurrence of brahma-medha and ultimate interiorization of Agni. Baballa  requested from his deathbed that nothing be done with his body until the  arrival of Ramam, who was at that time teaching in Pune, Maharashtra. After  a telegram reached him it took Ramam a day and a half on the train to reach  Rajahmundry, with a taxi down to Sriramapuram. For those steamy August  days, Baballa’s long frail body lay stretched across blocks of ice just outside his  agni-hotra room, a body, ritually and legally speaking, not yet dead. 

Ramam and the others immediately took out Baballa’s arani kindling  sticks and recreated fire in the garhapatya and then transferred embers to the  ahavaniya and daksinagni until the final time when fires burned in all three  hearths. A final isti in the house was completed and prayascitta, expiatory ritu 

als as recompense for agni-hotra, isti, and an agrayana that could not be per formed in the last days of Baballa’s and Sundari’s incapacitation. Embers from  each hearth were then dropped into kunda, terra-cotta pots slung from cords,  each marked “g,” “a” or “d” in Telugu letters. A fourth pot was marked for the  aupasana household fire. These were carried in front of the body out the door  and down the path by the terminally ill son, Bullebayi, who required support to  walk, as did the quite feeble widow, Sundari. Grandson Prasad was that crutch  for both until he had to turn back at the polimera, the sacred boundary. His own  father, Bullebayi, was still living and he, Prasad, could therefore not participate  in Baballa’s funeral. Embers from Baballa’s three hearths were now transferred  a final time onto his body, the ahavaniya offering fire beside his head, the dak 

sinagni beside his chest, the garha-patya cooking fire by his right thigh, each  igniting straw that then set wood alight. Within three hours Baballa’s body was  no more, his agni-hotra fires having burned together and conjoined as Agni. 

Brahma-medha, punar-dahana, and lost-aciti are rarely performed rituals  beyond the expertise of local apara Brahmans who supervise the last rites of  laukika Brahmans and non-Brahmans. Even if they knew or had access to the  texts, however, it is considered risky to call them into service because of their  unclean status. For Baballa, an apara Brahman of good reputation, Akondi  Suryanarayana, was brought from Amalapuram to conduct the normal rituals  from cremation through the twelfth day. On the thirteenth day, however, the  bone collection (asthi-samcayana), special re-cremation (punar-dahana), and  layout of a losta-citi constructed of blocks of mud bricks (istaka) were in the  hands of Chirravuri Ramam, Baballa’s longtime student and spiritual “son,”  with Duvvuri Yajulu and Bulusu Cayanulu assisting from the Pitr-medha  Sutras. Most of these kriya and mantras, being unfamiliar ones, were directed 

68 vedic voices 

by reading the text, but from time to time well-known mantras would surface  and allow the officiating troupe to relax into customary rhythms. Ashes with  fragments of bones and teeth had been collected a day after cremation and now  a portion was ground on two natural stones found at the cremation ground,  mixed with ghee, and reburned in order to obliterate all traces of soma. 

There was no need to save the remainder of his ashes for the Ganga, said  the elders; his beloved flowing Kausika is where they belong. Back at the house  the ayatana clay fire pits were scraped away two weeks after the sapindi-karana ritual that advanced Baballa’s preta to the status of pitr, ancestor. Baballa’s nec essary monthly rites, masikas, were done by Bullebayi only four times, the last  on the morning he himself died. It was quite difficult to convince Sundari,  Bullebayi’s mother, that her son was gone since she was completely deaf and  her eyesight too feeble to read signs devised for her. She insisted that he was  sleeping. Sundari died in July and daughter-in-law Savitri, in her white wid ow’s garb, became resigned to the sudden absence of two generations from  the well-visited house on the corner of the road.2 

3.1.1.6 The Extended Family 

The house at the head of the lane is still a local resource, one sought out  by folk in need of muhurta and dharma-sandeha responses, the former being  determination from a pancanga astrological manual of the correct “hour” for  a particular ceremony, the latter being answers to “doubts about the law.”  Previously it was Baballa who was the respected authority. Now it is his grand 

son, Yajnesvara Prasad. From his grandfather Prasad learned all eighty-two  panna of Taittiriya until age nineteen, at the same time pursuing studies for  a bachelor of science degree. A bachelor of education degree followed and he  accepted a teaching post close to Sriramapuram. Earlier, in 1978, he had been  married to Laksmi Narasakanta from Palakollu when he was seventeen and she  was twelve. When Laksmi came of age she was welcomed to Sriramapuram  as a lively girl of astonishing beauty, and there was hope of resumed continu 

ity in a Vedic srauta heritage. In a few years she gave birth to three successive  daughters, Rekha, Madhuri, and Kalyani, whose screams and yelps at play  rang down the dusty lane. But there were only daughters, and with the third  came a medical report, tragic for any Hindu but devastating for a Vaidika lin 

eage, that she could bear no more children. The Brahmibuta-Baballa legacy  was closed. 

Yajnesvara Prasad, a gentle, always affable man, and no doubt a compas sionate and effective mentor for youngsters, teaches Telugu, math, sciences,  and social studies to pupils age six to eleven. Except for Telugu all his subjects 

A Selection of Ahitagni and Other Veda Pandits 69 

are regarded as “English education,” huna-vidya. Prasad does not speak  English but nevertheless advances the curricula of the foreign occupiers of  India. On the other hand, more palatable to his elders, he serves as secretary  for the Godavari Mandala Veda Parishad in nearby Amalapuram as his con 

tribution to Vaidika society. In his youth he accepted rtvij roles, hotr in local  agrayana, for example, but that was years ago. He still recites, but without real  authority, in a tentative, almost listless voice. Although he has had encourage ment to go further he admits that for him the srauta life of his forbears is an  unlikely prospect. (See Figure 3.3, Yajnesvara Prasad and Laksmi with daugh ters Rekha, Madhuri, and Kalyani, Sriramapuram, 2005.) 

It was Prasad who described many of the subtler aspects of Baballa’s life  since it was his tata-garu, grandfather, rather than his father who was the true  adhi-kara, authority, for his upbringing, and Baballa’s counsel bore something  close to divine imprint in the mind of the youth. Now living in the house con 

structed by Baballa he is daily reminded of his grandfather’s life. Prasad related  that Baballa knew every detail of smarta rituals but never once performed one.  It was Bulusu Cayanulu, another ahitagni in the agrahara, who served as fam ily purohita in a hereditary role going back to Baballa’s great-great-grandfather.

Baballa and Sundari understood the needs of ahitagni who came to the  area for sabha, marriages, and other events, so for more than twenty years  from the 1970s to 1990s they went to Mukkamalla for forty days in Sravana  and Bhadrapada, taking food cooked in Sundari’s kitchen for guests who could  not eat in non-ahitagni houses. And it was Prasad who revealed what Baballa  had said of the scholar from America in those early visits in the 1980s: “He is  one of us,” said Baballa, “and has more interest in Vedic tradition than people  here. For some samsara reason he was destined to be born elsewhere. But he  belongs to our country, our region, our place. To disseminate our tradition he  was born in that faraway country.” 

The extended family might also be said to include Chirravuri Srirama  Sarma, “Ramam,” Baballa’s prize pupil, without whom he said his funeral  should not proceed. Ramam assisted his guru for years with routine isti and  with him studied Veda, Mimamsa, Vyakarana, and Tarka. He was interviewed  when he was visiting Baballa in Sriramapuram and also in his own home  in Rajahmundry while he was teaching Sanskrit courses in the Government  Oriental College. For three years, including the time that Baballa died, he held  a teaching position at Pune University but found scholarly life there not to his  liking. “People in Pune do research and write books of no practical value to  society.” The affection between Baballa and Ramam was palpable and in obvi ous ways the latter was more than the spiritual descendant in the guru-sisya 

relationship; he was the son Baballa did not have. Although Baballa did not  remark on it, Ramam’s decision to enter a laukika career as a Sanskrit rather  than a Veda pandit must have been a painful one. 

Ramam has his own pragmatic agenda for the significance of the Vedas  and will hold forth seated cross-legged on a high square stool for as long as  three hours at a stretch. He is convinced that ancient sciences were central in  the Vedas and somehow through “a break in the sampradaya” this knowledge  was lost. “We must recover that wisdom and experiment with it.” He shares  with some Native American Indians a belief that all the mineral, herbal, and  animal resources of the planet are sufficient to solve global problems if only  humans recognize and coordinate them. Passionately he wishes to establish  a “Center for Research in the Sciences of Ancient India” to mine the Vedas  for cures of disease and other misfortunes—leprosy, leukoderma, deafness  (“cured with application of seven types of earth, including clay from an ant hill”), snakebite (“for a cure one needs first to know if it is a Brahman, Ksatriya,  Vaisya, or Sudra snake”), fever, heart disease, tuberculosis (“derived from con 

tact with women”), gray hair, wayward satellites in space, and on and on. At the  time of the Bhopal Union Carbide disaster he reported that eyesight damaged  by poison gases had been restored when Veda pandits recited mantras while 

A Selection of Ahitagni and Other Veda Pandits 71 

pouring ghee into a sacrificial fire. Aside from these views, eccentric even to  many within the tradition, Ramam has taught at least one son and thereby  provided a measure of continuity from the mouth of guru Baballa into the  future. 

The loss of Baballa had a profound effect on the four remaining ahitagni in  the Sriramapuram, Nedunuru, Vyaghresvaram circle as they recognized their  own advanced years and the lack of replacements in succeeding generations.  Only one of the four had a son who might some day qualify to set the fires.  There was much discussion of Baballa’s sagacity, quick wit, and remarkable  ability to see through ephemera to the reality at hand. Once as he passed by  when the dora was interviewing Duvvuri Yajulu he remarked affably “What’s  happening?” “Oh, nothing much,” replied Yajulu, “just discussing the texts.”  In mock horror Baballa immediately retorted, “What do you mean just the  texts! You are the text!” 

#### 2 Duvvuri Yajulu (1915–2005) and  

His Descendants 

When Baballa and Sundari, with son Bullebayi and his wife Savitri and their  one-year-old son Prasad, moved to the new agrahara known as Sriramapuram,  their neighbor across the lane was a younger man who had been offering  agni-hotra twice daily for some seventeen years, the last seven of them in a  newly built Sriramapuram house. This ahitagni was Duvvuri Yajnesvara  Paundarika Yajulu, born in Kapilesvarapuram in 1915, another Veda pandit  with a long and colorful family history of Veda and srauta. “Yajulu” is a Telugu  personal name, short for soma-yajulu, Sanskrit soma-yajin, soma-sacrificer.  Since it occurs as a name in several other families, Duvvuri Yajulu will serve  to distinguish him later on, whereas here in this brief sketch he will be simply  Yajulu. His gotra was Atreya. He possessed a generous spirit and had kind  words even for those whom other pandits disparaged. 

The author spent more time with Yajulu and his descendants than with  members of any other of the ten extended families in this account. Long con versations with him occurred from October 1980 to March 2005, by which  date he had almost entirely lost his memory and was to live only four more  months until his death at the age of ninety. During the span of interviews, four  generations of Duvvuris flourished, including three of certified Veda pandits  and the hope of a fourth generation committed to Veda. In 1980, Yajulu’s Veda  pandit third son was twenty-seven; by 2000 that third son’s first son, Phani,  was already ghana-pathi and had a four-year-old son nearing upanayana. The  ahitagni status of Yajulu and his father and brother, however, is not currently

manifest by any Duvvuri. Eligibility for such has been barely maintained and  the sons of the ghana-pathi grandson taught by Yajulu are no longer candidates  for some future attempt at perpetuating the srauta lineage. On his sixtieth  birthday when the family photo (Figure 3.4) was taken, Yajulu could not have  suspected that in 2014, of all the gathered male descendants only one would  retain both eligibility and any future desire for srauta, an obviously squirming  Phani on the lap of Yajulu’s third son, Surya Prakasa Avadhani. Surya Prakasa  declared in 2014 that he and Kanaka Durga have abandoned plans to set fires  and begin agni-hotra. Phani’s two boys have chosen English education. 

3.1.2.1 Veda 

To Yajulu, Veda was transmitted first by his father for four years at home,  then for another five years in Mukkamala by Baballa’s father, Chinna  Subrahmanya Somayajulu. After examinations he then went in succession  to his older sister’s husband in Korumilli, to Vyaghresvaram, and to Tanuku  westward across the river, all for srauta and other subjects before completing  his formal Vedic education at age twenty-four in 1939. By that time he was  already married, father of a son and a daughter, and teaching Veda while

still a student in srauta. “I was illiterate and could not sign my name,” he  recalls, perhaps with a prideful ounce of exaggeration. “Reading and writing  I acquired in the course of time. I never went to school. There was no activity  other than Veda.” On another occasion Yajulu explained one source of his  early commitment: “My grandfather was a militant Vaidika!” 

One of his prized early accomplishments was correct recitation of “svasti,”  the svasti-vacana, Rg Veda 1.89 to the Visvedevas, in krama, ghana, and jata.  “One who can recite svasti flawlessly is considered to be a vira, a hero.” Group  svasti fascinated him. “There is a special spirit generated by performing  together. Once we all went from Sriramapuram together with our wives to  recite svasti for twenty-seven days in Hyderabad. That was a wonderful time!”  On another occasion he noted that “because I had to move out of my home vil 

lage to many other places for the sake of Vedic learning I could not be a farmer  and look after our lands. So I could never be like my neighbor Lanka (another  ahitagni), an active farmer for fifty years.” 

3.1.2.2 Srauta 

Grandson of an ahitagni, son of an ahitagni, younger brother of an ahitagni, dis ciple of Baballa’s ahitagni father: it is not surprising, therefore, to hear Yajulu  say in his sightless old age “I lived my entire life in the srauta tradition. I knew  nothing other than this!” Untrue, of course, as his command of Veda was such  that even though totally blind and dependent on others to walk a hundred  steps to bathe in the river, he was still teaching one grandson at a time at age  eighty-six, longer than any Veda pandit in this survey. (See Figure 2.4, a blind  

Duvvuri Yajulu teaching grandson Kirin, Sriramapuram 2000.) His devotion to agni-hotra, however, did indeed come early. He noted a tra ditional division of life into three stages: prime, middle age, and old age. “As a  rule, yajna should be performed when one attains age thirty-three, the begin ning of the middle years. By sixty-one, the beginning of the ‘immobile’ (stha vara) years of old age, one’s legs and hands may not be in control to maintain  ritual procedures.” By Yajulu’s criteria, therefore, Baballa had barely slipped  into agni-hotra in time and he himself was ahead of schedule, performing  agni-stoma at age thirty in 1945, the earliest of the ahitagni in this survey with  one exception. A decade later, in 1955, Yajulu’s nephew Mitranarayana estab lished the fires and accomplished yajna at age twenty-two. 

The adhana and agni-stoma for Yajulu were both in Kapilesvarapuram, the  village of his birth. He had to prod his older brother to do them first so that  he could follow. Four years later, in 1949, he accomplished agni-cayana in the  cow pasture of Kapilesvarapuram designated for great srauta sacrifices. Again  he inspired the older brother to go first. During the years between his cayana

74 vedic voices 

and the forty-day extended form of agni-cayana known as paundarika in 1969  there were always rtvij for his routine isti and agrayana. As his sons grew into  manhood they were recruited into roles at new and full-moon offerings. 

At one point Yajulu himself was rtvij in a paundarika and decided then and  there he would like to perform his own. From that moment it remained a fas cination in all its details and co-opted any formal interest in sastra. Thirty years  after that sacrifice he still loved to muse over a feature at a time. For example,  in response to a query on the textual requirement of the maha-vrata portion of  the paundarika, sexual intercourse on the antar-vedi, the coupling of a brahma carin, a Vedic student under a vow of celibacy, and a hired pumscali, prostitute,  he circled around this transgressive act meant to arouse mysterious powers of  fertility, and found a deft and clever way to excuse it. 

On the arugu of Baballa’s house rather than his own, Yajulu was always  affable, welcoming, and a genial conversationalist. Only once did his arugu net  a visit and that was after Surya died. The view through the open door to the  Tulsi fort in the courtyard was memorable: a white agni-hotra cow and a black  buffalo calf munching hay in the waning sunlight. Guarded, shrewd, even  crafty are perhaps also accurate depictions of Yajulu. He did not have Baballa’s  open personality. Much was offered in long conversations, but some things  were withheld, particularly with regard to certain details of srauta life. About  forthcoming rituals he was even duplicitous, but then so were many others,  those cards being held close to the vest, perhaps for fear of saying something  in error. 

A good illustration of his harbored privacy was revealed by his grandson,  Sita Ram Sastry, who had been along on a visit to nearby Vyaghresvaram. The  ahitagni Bulusu Kamesvara and wife Satyavati (described below in this chap ter) were immediately happy to have their agni-hotra hearths photographed.  Yajulu was shocked to hear this from his grandson. “To show my agni-hotra room to others, that would be like lifting my mother’s skirts!” That outburst  made understandable the fact that during twenty-five years his arugu was too  intimate a space for interviews, too close to invisible sacred hearths, even when  they were finally cold. His personal ritual life was, to use his word, rahasya,  secret. And his wife, Surya Somidevamma, was not to be seen. 

Exaggerated praise is common currency in Telugu conversation and rou tine wisdom effectively discounts it. There is something defensive in the  employment of relentless flattery of an interlocutor. With Yajulu, who identi fied the dora as “a second Maxmuller,” or a Mahatma, or “a mine of knowl edge,” without a hint of sarcasm, it was wise to be wary and remain untrapped.  And yet he always maintained a respectful ear to each query. Many years after  our first meeting in 1980, the same grandson described how he frequently 

A Selection of Ahitagni and Other Veda Pandits 75 

recounted that occasion when the American, upon hearing that he had done  cayana, asked “Which cayana?” “My God,” thought Yajulu to himself, “how  many kinds are there! I’d better study them!” 

3.1.2.3 Marriage 

Marriage was a topic that Yajulu frequently inserted into discussions,  sometimes as philosophical reflection, sometimes while marveling at the  cultural changes in the passage of four generations. His own marriage of  sixty-seven years to Surya (1922–96) was by all indications a fulfilling one,  and with ten children as evidence, a creative one at that. His view of the  marital union in general was always a lofty, highly positive one. In the con 

text of marriage he spoke of paramartha, the highest truth, sraddha, faith,  and even brahma-loka, the heaven of Brahma. And he saw a kind of sacred  joy for the entire community in the drama of the ceremony. On one occa sion he spoke of husband and wife coming to know one another in truth.  “In the vivaha the groom looks at the bride, sees her in a profane way, sees  whether or not she has fair skin, whether or not clothing covers her body.  He may glance at her a hundred times during the five-day ceremony. But  that is not seeing!” It takes considerable time, he insisted, to arrive at truly  seeing this partner for life. 

Unlike Baballa, who knew his cousin Sundari in childhood, Yajulu had  not met his bride before the wedding when she was seven and he was “about  thirteen or fourteen.” His father and uncle arranged the union with a girl  from across the Gautami-Godavari in the isolated village of Nedunuru, well  off roads and navigable waterways. She was a distant relative so it was not a  cross-cousin marriage. “Those five days were wonderful,” recalled Yajulu of  the festival more than half a century before. “My wife’s father cooked, not her  mother! And mithayi, special sweets, were served. Those were pavitra (sacred,  pure) days. I was given a dowry of 116 silver rupees. My brother-in-law carried  them in a cloth over his shoulder. In those days a rupee was two and a half tola of silver. Also I received a crimson silk panca (lower garment) and my sisters  each got a gold sovereign worth Rs. 13 each. My father spent Rs. 200 on jew 

elry for the bride, waistband, necklace, bangles.” 

It was Yajulu who explained how the husband is guru to a wife, instructing  her in the necessary mantras for their ritual life together. “There are special  mantras for women, many of them. Only these are to be recited,” as he quoted  in full the Sutra authority. After sixteen years of marriage, when he had decided  upon a date for yajna, he taught her the agni-stoma mantras. And it was Yajulu  who expressed many years later, some four years after she died, that mystery  of how she, a somi-devamma, obtained soma and why her cremated bones had76 vedic voices 

to be reburned in a special ritual. An ahitagni’s wife, he said, does not drink  soma but receives the power of this bone-binding sacred plant by eating the  food left-overs, the ucchista, of her husband. 

It was a fruitful marriage, beginning with a son and a daughter before  Yajulu had finished his formal education at the age of twenty-four. “My wife  delivered fourteen times, always in our house. For four rupees a Yerukala  tribal woman came as midwife. Medicines in those days were simple, inex 

pensive, easy to get.” Yajulu never mentioned the four children who did not  survive, and Surya was never permitted to appear for an interview although  requests were made. Always he spoke with great pride in numbers, five sons,  five daughters. “Once when I  was visiting in Hyderabad a woman learned  that I had ten children and she came in reverance to touch my feet.” In an  interview in 1996 the tape recorder was drowned out by a tribe of whooping  children. “Seems like every pandit in the agrahara has twenty grandchildren,”  ventured the dora. “Oh, many more than that!” countered Yajulu, “and I am  king of them all with forty so far!” 

Settling five daughters’ marriages was not difficult, says Yajulu, per haps the only pandit denying concern over the older dowry system. In the  1940s and 1950s his name and rank were esteemed throughout the delta.  By contrast, he complained in the 1990s, the values of society changed so  markedly his attempts to facilitate marriage settlements seemed counter productive. “My son-in-law asked me to arrange the marriage of my grand daughter. She is not a B.A. and cannot go out and earn money, which is  what parents want for their sons now. Values have shifted. Family tradition,  a Vedic heritage, generations of Veda teaching and soma sacrificing, all that  falls on deaf ears. My presence will not make any difference in the prospect  of her marriage.” As patriarch he still decided names for all the newborn,  however, right down to the great-grandsons born when he was approaching  the age of ninety. 

3.1.2.4 A Burgeoning Family 

In 1936 Yajulu named his first son Sarvesvara Somayajulu, an obvious hope  that he would be the conduit for the long-running ahitagni lineage to survive  intact. The boy began well, completed Veda entirely with Yajulu at age nine teen, married that year, and went on to complete ghana with a Gorti family  ghana-pathi. But at some point, as Sarvesvara told it, the god Siva intervened  and totally captured his attention. His life was turned over to one of studying  the Siva Purana, going repeatedly to Kasi to worship Siva in the temple of  Visvanatha, bathing in the Ganga “to purify the soul and concentrate on the

worship of Isvara to achieve mukti,” all the while earning a bare subsistence  in Konasima from sambhavana, honoraria for ghana recitations of Veda at  weddings or other family rituals. By reciting for Brahmans or other high  castes the Satarudriya from the Taittiriya Samhita, Sarvesvara could indulge  both his craving to worship Rudra-Siva and his need to earn a Veda pandit  livelihood. When asked in February 2000 if he had ever entertained the idea  of setting fires he became entirely agitated: “Yogam! Daivam! Isvara! Isvara!  The worship of Isvara! That achieves mukti!” A  remarkable devotion:  in  twenty-five years Yajulu did not mention Siva by name and his son thinks  only of him. Neither of Sarvesvara’s two sons learned Veda although one of  his two daughters was married to a Veda pandit and has a son who went to  Iragavaram for adhyaya with great-grandfather Gullapalli Sita Ram Sastri  (discussed later). 

Lanka, the sage of Nedunuru down the road from Sarvesvara’s home in  Irusumanda village, noted that Sarvesvara rejected Lanka’s offer to teach the  ritual Sutras of Apastamba: “He thinks of earning money, has no interest in  further learning.” By taking cash for reciting Veda he earned the disdain of  Lanka, whose view was that a life as Siva bhakta (devotee) counts for little  against the waste of a highly trained Veda pandit from an ahitagni lineage.  And further, noted Lanka and many others, he stood in the way of an eligible  younger brother, Surya Prakasa Avadhani, who was (at that time) a more prob able candidate to set the fires. 

The Duvvuri family history provides a good illustration of some of the pit falls that lie in wait to derail a cherished lineage of srauta. Bhakti can here  be added to the list of tangents alongside inability to complete Veda, failure  to marry (and marry properly), sibling blockade when an older brother does  not set fires, and incapacity to maintain the ritual purity of fire by living in  a separate dwelling. To an observer, Sarvesvara existed in a Vedic/Puranic  half-light, a Siva bhakta, but not a pauranika by profession, an earner of his  keep as a Veda pandit ghana-pathi, but not one committed wholly to Veda  and certainly not to the srauta life of his father. Technically not laukika, since  he was employed by the TTD until he retired on pension as a vrddha pandit  in 1994, his stance is on the threshold between “Vedism” and Hinduism. All  that appeared to change suddenly in 2007 when he declared that he would  set the fires and go on to agni-stoma. In that same year the younger brother  Surya Prakasa Avadhani and Kanaka Durga made that decision. But neither  family followed through beyond vaisva-deva. Yajulu’s second, fourth, and fifth  sons entered laukika careers outside of Veda. The vocation of third son Surya  Prakasa is described later. Four generations of males in the Duvvuri family are  presented in Table 3.2.

3.1.2.5 Last Rites 

Surya spent a long night at a marriage festival across the lane at Samavedam’s  house. Before resting in the morning she decided to offer special food she  had cooked for the goddess Durga for Navaratri. She circled the Tulsi fort of  Ammavaru three times, then fell against the compound wall screaming. “I  was doing agni-hotra,” reported Yajulu. “I got up, made my way feeling along  the wall until I reached her. With the last breath karma mantras have to be  recited into a dying person’s ears. I could not tell if she was still breathing but  I recited those mantras.” They were verses from the Taittiriya Upanisad about  brahman as truth and the breath of life. 

After seventy-one years of marriage Baballa died and received Agni in the  form of the three fires that he and Sundari Somidevamma had maintained  as co-sacrificers. Sundari lived less than eleven months without him before  her ordinary pyre was ignited by arani, the only ritual implements to sur 

vive his antyesti. With the death of Surya in December 1996 the other side  of such co-sacrificial termination is visible. No prayascitta expiations were  required for Surya; both had taken pains to perform agrayana together as  always at Dipavali in the autumn of 1996. The musi-vayanam for the auspi 

cious wife who dies first was performed by the side of the canal.3 For her  funeral it was now the patni who received brahma-medha. Yajulu, sightless,  stood by and listened to the crackling fire consume all their ritual imple ments from fifty-one years of isti and soma sacrifices. “She took the fires with  her! Now I will have to go with kitchen matches!” said Yajulu with a macabre  sense of humor. But up in the rafters of the house they had shared for the  

A Selection of Ahitagni and Other Veda Pandits 79 

last half-century of their sixty-seven-year marriage he knew that arani lay  wrapped in gunny cloth awaiting a final task, the kindling of his own crema tion fire at the burning ground where Surya’s ashes had now been gathered  for reburning. 

Only after her death did Yajulu reveal to his family an almost folkloric  account of a wise man’s prophecy. His third son provided his words: “After  my agni-stoma I went to a sabha in West Godavari District in Sravana masa. An  old man faced me directly, ‘Are you the one who performed yajna?’ I answered  him ‘yes’ and then he said ‘Took a lot of trouble to do it but you will have no  benefit.’ I was in shock. What is he talking about? I just completed it three  months ago and now I am hearing this inauspicious comment. Seeing my dis 

may, the old man said ‘Have no fear. After you have crossed the line of eighty  years all these agni-hotra will be taken away by your wife.’ And it is a pattern  in the family: my grandmother died first, her mother-in-law, my father’s older  brother’s wife.” 

As a widower Yajulu could eat no rice for the evening meal, only phalahara snacks, with rice, essential “food,” at noon only. One day in his last years he  reminisced and recalled his mother at the age of eighty-six. “She suddenly  asked me a strange question:  ‘Boy, has God (devudu) forgotten to call me?  Somebody please tell him!’ I understand her feelings now.” He died July 30,  2005, only four months after an annual sabha was founded in his name in  Sriramapuram. He was burned on the same spot as Surya almost a decade  before. 

3.1.2.6 Third Son Venkata Surya Prakasa Avadhani 

The year 1953 brought disastrous floods in the region with the river breach ing levees and cresting at the old Havelock railway bridge at Rajahmundry  at sixty-five feet. The Kapilesvarapuram area was devastated. But that year  brought good fortune in the form of a third son for Yajulu and Surya, some  seventeen years, almost a generation, after Sarvesvara. Venkata Surya  Prakasa, born in Kapilesvarapuram, had his upanayana eight years later, and  learned Veda from his father only, completing the course in eight years. Up  at 5 am for snana and sandhya-vandana while his father did agni-hotra, it was  then Veda until noon when it was time to accompany his father for mid 

day snana and sandhya-vandana. At age twenty he was examined in Veda  and srauta by the Godavari Mandala Parisad when it was in Vyaghresvaram  in 1973. Avadhani could then be added to his name.4 Marriage to Kanaka  Durga, a cousin Gullapalli daughter, had already occurred in Iragavaram in  1970 when he was seventeen and she was twelve. He had no formal school 

ing until age sixteen and like his father felt unsure of the Telugu alphabet, 

80 vedic voices 

aksara-bhasya, until he began to walk from Sriramapuram to a school in  Mukkamala. 

After examinations he was on track to follow in his father’s footsteps but  decided instead to prepare for a career as a Telugu/Sanskrit pandit and com pleted studies to that end in a college in nearby Moddekurru, finishing in  1976. Traveling by train he also took a five-month course in Warangal. A sur plus of qualified pandits made employment difficult to find and he took up the  study of kavya in Sriramapuram under Ravi Cayanulu, living on loans until  he could repay them with honoraria from reciting at sabha. He appeared at  several examination centers, Vyaghresvaram, Rajahmundry, Guntur, and two  in Vijayawada. 

In 1982, almost age thirty, Surya Prakasa moved from the Sriramapuram  agrahara for the first time for five years of Mimamsa studies, five hours every  day, with Remella Surya Prakasa Sastri in Rajahmundry, the town where the  first of almost twenty interviews for this survey took place. Long train trips to  Hyderabad, Srisaila, and other distant places brought sambhavana honoraria  for joining in recitations and there were also local life-cycle rites to conduct.  The full range of procedures for samskara he had learned from Yajulu, who  seldom if ever exercised the craft. Once in Hyderabad for a marriage in a  traditional Brahman family he was stunned to find no agni-hotrin wife cook ing food, his first such encounter, and he had to survive on snacks. All these  years he served as adhvaryu for his father’s routine isti, and those of another  ahitagni, and recited daily in TTD service in a temple in Mukkamala first,  then the Satyanarayana temple in Rajamundry (see Figure 3.5, Surya Prakash  Avadhani and Kanaka Durga). 

By January 1988 he and Kanaka Durga, now with a full complement of four  sons (Figure 3.6), with no daughters or irksome dowries, were celebrating the  marriage of their first son, Phani Yajnesvara Yajulu, a student in Veda with  grandfather Yajulu in Sriramapuram agrahara. Again for a new generation,  the Duvvuri-Gullapalli cross-cousin marital scheme was operative and Phani  was married to Laksmi (Nagalaksmi) in her home village of Iragavaram, West  Godavari District. Embarking on the four sons and no daughters pattern, soon  there were two sons and no daughters. 

Surya Prakasa, a soft-spoken, serious, and thoughtful man who speaks  slowly and in full detail after he gives every question long consideration, made  a remarkably candid observation regarding his relationship with his father  Yajulu: “It was only when I had sons of my own that I was able to sit down with  my father for anything other than learning Veda.” In 1987 Surya Prakasa con 

fided his plans to return to Sriramapuram agrahara, continue in TTD temple  recitation for livelihood, and then eventually set fires and do agni-stoma. It

appeared to be a conscious effort to replicate his father’s career. All the same  he was well aware of the distance between his father’s generation and his own.  “Since I cannot live like my father,” he offered, “the best path open to me is to  try to minimize my needs and interaction with others. To the extent that it is  possible I will try to emulate the ideals of Vedic life. But I am conscious of the  society in which I live.” 

A decade later, however, he was still in Rajahmundry. Circumstances  changed in an interesting way when a small enclave in the thriving town  became a makeshift agrahara, an opportune replacement for Sriramapuram.  A wealthy member of the Duvvuri clan donated a house and its beautiful  walled-off compound to Srngeri Pitha with the intention of founding a school.  No teacher was available and Surya Prakasa was given the house and its stun 

ning enclosed orchard as a guru-kula where he could live rent-free as long as  he taught Veda to his own and his brothers’ sons. 

3.1.2.7 Duvvuri Phani Yajnesvara Yajulu 

Surya Prakasa’s first son is a good illustration of a betwixt-and-between edu cational pattern, flip-flopping between Veda and huna-vidya, a Vaidika or a  laukika career. Phani, born in 1974, received Veda in Sriramapuram agrahara from grandfather Yajulu in the old man’s waning, completely blind years, but  also went to school and did an intermediate degree in English studies. He is  the first and, to date, the only certified Veda pandit in this entire survey to  speak any English. His plan to follow a bachelor of commerce with a master  of business arts degree and find employment in the Karnataka State Bank  changed when he turned back to Veda and followed his krama examination  with one in ghana, having learned first from Samavedam Venkata Ramana  in Sriramapuram, then from a well-known ghana-pathi in Vijayawada,  Visnubhatla Laksminarayana. Phani took the train and spent three days a  week with the latter, who served more as monitor of his progress than as tra ditional guru. Immediately after his 1999 certification in ghana at the age of  twenty-five he plunged into Mimamsa, as his father had done, and advanced  in srauta studies. 

Phani, a solid man with a sturdy body, huskier than his father or grand father, has a strong round face and pleasant disposition. He was married  at fourteen to ten-year-old Laksmi (Nagalaksmi), daughter of his mother’s  brother, Gullapalli Venkata Rama Suryanarayana. Two sons were born to  them, Surya Prakasa Pavankumar Sarma, named for his paternal grand father, in 1996, and Syama Sundara Srirama Sarma, two years later.  When brought out for viewing, the latter was described, in deference to 

A Selection of Ahitagni and Other Veda Pandits 83 

family planning, as “the final one.” At the age of eight the older boy began  Taittiriya texts with his father in February 2005. Not surprisingly, given his  father’s abilities in English, he also studied in an English-medium school,  with roughly equal time, five to five-and-a-half hours each day for Veda and  English. He is the first Veda pandit descendant in this study to attend ele 

mentary school classes in English. 

Like other young pandits in Konasima, Phani received offers from Hindu  temples to do parayana in America and once received an invitation to be a  rtvij in a ritual in New Jersey. When asked if he might take up such invita tions he replied in 2005 that grandfather Yajulu forbade such an assign ment, “and that means not now or ever.” Earlier, in February 2000, the  grhya-pravesa house consecration was performed for a newly constructed  five-room flat in another part of Rajahmundry and the young four-member  family moved in, leaving the Srngeri-pitha house to his parents and three  remaining younger brothers. In 2009 Phani accepted a teaching position  in Sri Venkatesvara University in Tirupati where his facility in English as  well as Veda allowed him to advance rapidly to assistant professor in the  department of Krishna Yajurveda studies. He is the first Veda pandit in the  region to become a professor in a university. The Kanci Pitha honored him  with the title of Veda-bhasya Ratna. 

“It was the turning point in my life,” said Phani in 1998, “when my grand father Yajulu said to me ‘You are the one to continue!’ I no longer vacillated  between Veda and laukika careers.” Now, sixteen years later, the Duvvuri leg acy in Veda is assured, with additional merit awarded to a university professor.  But the Duvvuri srauta heritage now hangs by a slender thread. There may  have been a point at which Phani said commandingly to son Surya Prakasa  or his younger brother, “You are the one to continue!” If so, the admonition  was not heeded, and the necessary certification in Veda did not occur. Early  in 2014, health problems in the form of diabetes increased for both Surya  Prakasa and Kanaka Durga. The 2007 plans to follow vaisva-deva with adhana and agni-stoma were set aside. 

3.1.2.8 Duvvuri Sita Ram Sastry and “Saving the Dynasty” Like Phani, the second son of the elder Surya Prakasa began adhyaya with  grandfather Yajulu. Sita Ram Sastry (his chosen spelling of Sastri, his full  name being that of his maternal Gullapalli grandfather) sat down with Yajulu  first, then his older brother Phani. But neither effort at learning a portion of  the Taittiriya Samhita was successful. Stress brought on problems with his  throat, that indispensable organ for recitation, and he could not continue.  Thus his redemption, in his own words, was to become “savior of the dynasty”

in a Veda pandit family by obtaining degrees in information technology, secur ing an appointment in the United States in order to send dollars home to sup port his Veda-reciting father, brother Phani, and Phani’s sons, all of them at  that time representing the direct hope of Yajulu’s continuity in srauta as well  as Veda. A Veda pandit manqué, he could thus turn his ambition in going to  America into rupees for the home effort. And so he became one of an estimated  65,000 immigrants from India who entered the United States that year. He  flew to Hartford, Connecticut, his first time out of Andhra Pradesh, assigned  by Satyam Computers to the Cigna Insurance Company. Eventually his wife,  

Girija Syamala, along with son Karttikeya and daughter Pranati joined him. Outsourcing in reverse, that is, the luring of trained Indian computer  experts to the United States, attracted another of Yajulu’s grandsons who  arrived within three months of Sastry early in 2007. Sastry’s cousin Yajnesvara  Yajulu, first son of Yajulu’s first son Sarvesvara and therefore bearing Yajulu’s  exact name, flew to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Yet a third grandson of Yajulu,  Girija Sankar, employed in 2013 by Value Labs in Hyderabad, awaits assign ment abroad. Remarkable is the coincidence of American demands for staff ing urban Hindu temples for expatriate Indian communities on one hand,  and the needs of high-tech corporations on the other, both finding an Indian  solution. The older Veda pandits of Konasima who disdained temple requests  now have a growing number of descendants crossing the waters to fulfill the  technological requirements of corporate America. 

Surya Prakasa continues to be a valuable source of fine points of Vedic life  and thought. He leans down, elbows on knees as he searches the floor for the  clearest way to reply to queries and then, his voice deepening and softening,  spins out details. His four sons, grandsons of Yajulu, all took Gullapalli brides  and now have sons of their own. One became ghana-pathi and a university  professor. One has been employed in the United States for five years and may  soon be joined by another, a far-off land he has no intention of visiting. The  final segment of this chapter concerns the Gullapallis, and part of Chapter  5 continues discussion of the paradigmatic Duvvuri-Gullapalli cross-cousin  marriage pattern. A portion of the Epilogue returns to the question of America,  “polarities and dreams.” 

Strong memories of Sriramapuram linger for the dora:  Yajulu’s pow erful voice belting out long mantras in response to a query on srauta.  A  courageous Yajulu pacing back and forth beside the petite Pancayatana  temple reciting Atharva Veda mantras against the fading powers of his  glaucoma-arrested eyes and, years later, the sightless widower insisting on  finding his way alone across the dusty track to visit another house. And there  was that leave-taking one scorching afternoon while starting the trudge out

#### 3 Bulusu Cayanulu (1915–1997) 

The fifty-year-old house next-to-last at the far end of the agrahara lane stood  boarded up and empty for a year to allow ghosts and demons time to clear out.  If one had to walk that way it was done quickly with averted gaze. Rituals were  done against “wind,” gali, and dust, a common Telugu expression for ghosts  and other dangerous malevolent forces. Inside the house a few cracked, dried  fragments of clay fireplaces scotched the floor. They should have been cleared  away to assure safe journey onward for the deceased house owner, but he had  died suddenly under an inauspicious constellation. After funerary procedures  the house was hastily abandoned. 

The deceased was Bulusu Vyaghresvara Cayanulu (1915–97), the third ahi tagni on the fourteen-house lane of Sriramapuram agrahara. Subbalaksmi, her  widow’s white sari draped over her cropped white hair, returned to the house  in which she had lived as a somi-devamma for more than three decades, but  stayed only a short time before moving to the spreading town of Rajahmundry  to live with a daughter and family. 

Curiously, although not unique within communities of pandits who bear  names of popular deities, ancient villages, and accomplished or wished for  rituals, there were two identically named Vaidika Brahmans of the same gotra (Gautama), born in the same tiny hamlet (Vyaghresvaram) only a few years  apart. Both became Veda pandits and then ahitagni. One remained in his  natal village all his life and became Bulusu Vyaghresvara Soma-yaji while the  other moved into Sriramapuram agrahara, performed agni-cayana, and there 

fore acquired the full name of Bulusu Vyaghresvara Cayanulu. Hereafter, this  second Vyaghresvara will be Bulusu Cayanulu to distinguish him from other  Bulusus and other Cayanulus (such as Ravi Cayanulu, a smarta Brahman neigh 

bor in Sriramapuram but neither an ahitagni nor performer of agni-cayana). Everyone in the agrahara knows the story of the ancestor of Bulusu  Cayanulu who worshipped Ganesa all his days. In his old age, one day he  was surprised by the elephant-headed god’s sudden appearance before him.  A boon was granted as reward for lifelong determined devotion: for three suc cessive purusa, generations, his descendants would be distinguished Veda  pandits. Bulusu Cayanulu represented, in this fortuitous but sharply bordered  prediction, the third and final generation. When he died in 1997 he left no vis ible direct descendant in Veda.86 vedic voices 

One of three brothers, he was the only one who became a Veda pandit.  Along with a boy of the same age, Renducintala Venkatacalu, he became a  brahmacarin student of Venkatacalu’s father. This providential association had  long-term consequences. Venkatacalu became Renducintala Yajulu, the most  famous sacrificer and promoter of srauta rituals in twentieth-century India,  one whose name is a string of thirty-some sacrifices, a veritable litany recited  with awe and admiration by most Veda pandits of Andhra. The chanting of his  name always has the ring of an ideal mantra! 

Renducintala was born in the delta. Unlike Bulusu Cayanulu, who remained  in Konasima within a few miles of his birthplace, Renducintala Yajulu spent  most of his life in Kasi (Varanasi) where he died in 1987. Frequent visits to  Andhra, mostly to a second house in Vijayawada on the Krishna River, but also  to the Godavari River Delta, kept him informed of the state of Veda and srauta 

in the territory of his birth. He and his wife, Laksmikanta, performed their  first yajna, the agni-stoma, in 1936, their last one in Kasi in 1980, and managed  more than half a century of agni-hotra over all. 

To return to Vyaghresvara (who was to become Bulusu Cayanulu), after  he and Venkatacalu completed the eighty-two panna the paths of the two  former classmates—now established Veda pandits, both married with fami lies started—intersected again when Vyaghresvara’s twenty-four-year-old  wife, Rama Suryakanta from Prakkilanka, suddenly died of typhoid fever in  1945. The musi-vayanam ritual for a wife who dies first was performed on  the tenth day by a brahma-muttaiduva, a special Brahman woman ritualist  who made the lengthy journey to Vyaghresvaram village from Rajahmundry.  The young couple’s son, Ramana Murti, was six years old. Venkatacalu, now  known as Renducintala Yajulu, wanted to recruit Vyaghresvara as rtvij in a  paundarika for his increasingly ambitious schedule of sacrifices. But a rtvij 

cannot be apatnika, without a wife. He must have married a pre-pubescent  girl in an authentic five-day vivaha. Therefore Renducintala Yajulu took on  the project of legitimizing his boyhood friend and colleague. In Gangalakurru  village he located a Brahman family willing to give fourteen-year-old daugh 

ter Subbalaksmi to a promising young pandit, although a thirty-year-old wid ower. They were married eight months after the unfortunate death of Rama  Suryakanta, and Vyaghresvara became eligible for srauta roles.5 

Subbalaksmi subsequently gave birth to three daughters, then a son, and  then a fourth daughter. (See Figure 3.7, Bulusu Cayanulu and Subbalaksmi,  Sriramapuram 1987.) Ramana Murti, the son from Vyaghresvara’s first mar riage, was raised by his grandmother in Vyaghresvaram and remained there  when the new family was invited to live in Sriramapuram, only a twenty-minute  walk through the fields. The lives of Renducintala Yajulu and Vyaghresvara

connected yet a third time when they struck a marriage alliance. Yajulu’s son  Satyanarayana would marry Vyaghresvara’s third daughter with no demands  for dowry. In lieu of cash or land, Vyaghresvara agreed to teach this prospective  son-in-law and became Satyanarayana’s principal guru. When the boy and girl  reached respective ages of fifteen and ten, they were married in Vijayawada. 

Meanwhile, Vyaghresvara had pursued multiple career paths. In accord  with a hereditary relationship, he prepared a more rigorous program in smarta than the normal Veda pandit curriculum. This began at age fifteen and con cluded with exams three years later. Baballa’s Bhamidipati ancestors had  depended for generations upon Vyaghresvara’s Bulusu ancestors for services  as brahma (purohita) for samskara and other domestic rites. Absent from such  services would be apara, funerary rituals that called for a special Brahman.  Until his declining years prevented further service and the Bhamidipati fam ily was forced to go outside the hereditary link, Bulusu Cayanulu remained  as brahma for Baballa’s descendants. To a greater degree than any other Veda  pandit covered here, Bulusu Cayanulu, with a lifetime of experience in both  srauta and smarta, was able to articulate what he clearly understood to be a  close relationship between the two ritual traditions and the Grhya and Srauta  Sutras of Apastamba that support them. It is sometimes said by scholars that  Smarta Brahmans are sharply delineated from those who perform srauta, but  Bulusu Cayanulu was living proof otherwise. 

88 vedic voices 

In addition to this dual profession he taught for fourteen years in a  veda-patha-sala in Billakurru, north of Vyaghresvaram on the other side of  the canal. He became an examiner in the Veda-certification process. And he  was invited regularly as rtvij in the rituals of Renducintala Yajulu and oth 

ers in Vyaghresvaram village. He estimated his participation in approximately  fifty or sixty rituals including six paundarika, often as udgatr. The srauta ethos of Konasima in the 1960s was infectious and in Magha 1965, at age  fifty, he performed adhana with agni-stoma on the following day by the side  of the little temple in Sriramapuram. And four years later, this time choos ing his natal village of Vyaghresvaram as site, he managed the sarva-prstha  agni-cayana that endowed him with the name Cayanulu. This was in 1969, the  same year in which his neighbor Duvvuri Yajulu added Paundarika to his full  name. (See Figure 3.8, Cayanulu, with Baballa behind, and others in a ritual,  Sriramapuram 1987.) 

Having founded the Sriramapuram agrahara on the right bank of the  Billakurru Canal, known more affectionately as the Kausika, the Dokka fam ily invited Vyaghresvara and Subbalaksmi to live there. A house plot plus an

acre of cropland were the donation. His ancestral lands had been sold off,  and then his donated agricultural acre had to be sold to pay for his daughters’  dowries (with the exception of the daughter given to Renducintala in exchange  for teaching). Eventually, when the TTD parayana system kicked in, he took  up service at age sixty-one in a temple in his natal village of Vyaghresvaram,  with additional recitations in nearby Pulletikurru. His retirement came at age  seventy-eight as a vrddha pandit pensioner with seventeen years of service.  Financial worries pursued him, however, and he continued to attend sabha that brought in small honoraria. The central government in Delhi provided  honoraria for agni-stomin for some years before he learned about it, giving him  opportunity to grouse: “The other ahitagni kept this secret from me.” 

Several “felicitations” honored him, one being in Hyderabad where he was  surprised to be greeted by the prime minister of India, P. V. Narasimha Rao,  a fellow Andhra native. No one had informed him of this distinction. To be  there, the eighty-year-old man had to bounce along alone for some twenty  hours on overnight buses. The honorarium for that event was rupees amount 

ing then to $35.13. But he was delighted by the honor. Another tribute came  from the Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister, the former film star N. T. Rama Rao,  a distinction in itself, having the familiar silver-screen idol Rama or Krishna  make the presentation. 

In family album photos Bulusu Cayanulu appears in his prime as a strik ingly handsome man. He was an impulsive, naturally affectionate man, the only  ahitagni ever to reach out and grasp the dora’s hands in both of his (once only).  He was a dependable, trustworthy individual, faithful to his professional and  familial duties, sincerely devoted to his own ritual life and to the ongoing sam skara and isti of others who depended on him as expert brahma or rtvij. Srauta rituals fascinated him, the form of agni-cayana that he had accomplished in par ticular. In his later years he was preoccupied with performing the catur-masya rites, which Baballa and Lanka had done and he had planned but never followed  through. Left undone, this complex ritual weighed heavily on his mind as a  significant unfulfilled duty. The agrayana, however, he and Subbalaksmi did as  usual in February 1996 in his eighty-first year, rekindling fires with prayascitta for failing to do it as he had intended in one of the three autumnal months of  1995, and then following up with isti for the subsequent fortnight. 

Bulusu Cayanulu was not the philosopher of the adjacent agrahara. Baballa  and Lanka were sought first as authorities, then Duvvuri Yajulu. He stated  his opinions forcefully, categorically, but often they were the odd ones out in  deliberations of the group and he was dismissed as eccentric. For example,  the aim of srauta, he would insist, is the cessation of births. But before he  could elaborate he would be cut off, overridden with contrary views. And his 

90 vedic voices 

statements were sometimes whimsical and extravagant. “In a Telangana vil lage called Manthini,” he once pronounced grandly, “there are 800 Brahman  families, all ahitagni, all ghana-pathi, and there they perform vaja-peya.” He  possessed a charming naivete. When visits to Sriramapuram occurred a week  or so apart he assumed a commute back to America had intervened. When  presented with a 1975 book by the dora, inscribed to all in the agrahara and  meant to be shared, he assumed with worried demeanor that it was about  him. It was never seen again. Cayanulu inadvertently added a capricious tenor  to conversations. In early years there was no admission to the interior of his  house, and when asked, while sitting on his arugu, about the exact location of  his agni-hotra, room he could find no way to describe it. A careful map of the  agrahara was drawn for him, including the path separating the two rows of  houses and a large empty square for his house. No amount of prodding gave  results. Finally, in desperation to locate his agni-hotras for the inquisitive dora he shouted “Here!” and stabbed the map with the point of a pen in the middle  of the path. 

Without lingering outside his door as he had done with Baballa, Mrtyu,  Lord of Death, rushed swiftly into Bulusu Cayanulu’s house and felled him  without warning. The heart attack came after he cycled home from the vil lage to unload groceries in anticipation of a visit from a daughter and her  husband. The older folk in the agrahara, prone to ruminate on the suffering  that precedes death, admired this as a proper, painless way to go. His funeral  just outside the agrahara included not only brahma-medha and punar-dahana,  but also the losta-citi ritual of piling mud bricks in commemmoration of his  agni-cayana twenty-eight years before. 

Subbalaksmi, a shy, pretty woman with an affectionate smile, was always in  the shadow of her much older husband’s wishes, fulfilling all chores and then  tending the agni-hotra during the thirty-two years she spent as a somi-devamma.  “From the time I was fourteen I was very reticent. I had so much bhaya (fear)  in the early days of our marriage.” Then, as one of several white-clad widows  in the agrahara, and later in her neighborhood of Rajahmundry, having long  since completed her constant program of nomu, ritual vows that are largely  for the protection of husband and sons, she spent her time reading about the  dasavatara, the ten incarnations of Visnu, and reading aloud to herself the  sahasra-nama, litanies of the thousand names of Visnu, the goddess Lalita,  and other deities. This she enjoys immensely. Subbalaksmi claims not to have  had knowledge of aksara (letters) until a few years after her husband’s passing.  He had always opposed, she says flatly, her desire to learn to read and write.  Unlike the other somi-devamma with daughters living only a few villages away,  Subbalaksmi’s daughters are spread out far beyond Konasima, perhaps due to 

A Selection of Ahitagni and Other Veda Pandits 91 

liaisons made long since through the more cosmopolitan center of Vijayawada  and the auspices of Renducintala Yajulu. Daughters have gone to Bangalore,  Tirupati, and Hyderabad, although remaining in Rajahmundry are one daugh ter as well as her only son. With far better bus service on vastly improved  roads, Rajahmundry can now be reached on a good day in less than two hours  instead of the five or more of former days. 

Bulusu Cayanulu’s legacy of Veda ended in the male vamsa (lineage) but  may possibly feed into another male line through a daughter, as in the case of  Lanka, Bulusu Kamesvara, and other ahitagni. His third daughter, married to  Renducintala’s fourth son, has a son with a college degree who also learned  Veda at home. Bulusu Cayanulu’s first son, Ramana Murti, who was raised by  his grandmother after the death of his mother in 1945, has a son doing smarta,  and thus another dimension of Bulusu Cayanulu’s career may also continue. 

Subbalaksmi has a photo album on her lap spread open to reveal the hand some young man in white, Bulusu before he became Cayanulu, Bulusu before  she was born. When she reflects about her life, Subbalaksmi has said on more  than one occasion: “Way back when he was born in Vyaghresvaram village,  ‘Cayanulu’ was written by the god Brahma on his forehead. And marriage to  him was what was written on mine.” 

Cayanulu was the second of Sriramapuram’s trio of ahitagni to go, leaving  only Yajulu. By 1997 the lane had not changed much in seventeen years. Off to  the south through the trees some houses had become visible in an expanding  non-Brahman hamlet. The school at the lane’s end boasted a new play area.  On a steamy March day half a dozen nearly naked workers split and husked  coconuts for coir while others loaded mammoth lorries destined for Gujarat,  Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh. On that morning no sounds of Veda competed  with the new enterprise. 

#### 4 Samavedam (1932–2008) and Sons 

A fourth habitually visible figure in the agrahara, well known and respected  throughout coastal Andhra, was Samavedam Suryanarayana Avadhani, Harita  gotra, resident of Sriramapuram for well over half a century. His grandfa ther was an ahitagni in Mukkamala but neither his Telugu pandit father nor  Samavedam himself chose the life of agni-hotra and srauta, preferring instead  to concentrate on steering sons into Vedic education. “I teach and recite  Veda,” said Samavedam, “and this is all my life.” In fact, both father and son  accomplished the same feat, each carefully preparing two out of four sons for  careers as Veda pandits and seeking as far as possible to marry daughters to  Veda pandits.

92 vedic voices 

Samavedam had the clear-eyed gaze of a fox on the hunt and the restless,  spare build of that focused prowler. There seemed to be no apparent limit to  his entrepreneurial energy. He was born on the next to last day of 1932, fourth  of the four brothers of his generation. After upanayana at age ten he spent ten  years learning Veda, initially with his oldest brother at home in Mukkamala,  then with Bulusu Vyaghresvara in Billakurru. This was long before this  Bulusu (Cayanulu above) became his guru and subsequently a neighbor in  the actual hamlet of Vyaghresvaram close to Sriramapuram. Yet another men tor was Rani Hayagriva in Indupalli. Samavedam did varalu and madhu-kara 

in each village of his three successive gurus and appeared successfully for his  exam in krama in Vijayawada in 1955.6 By that time he had married Kamala,  younger sister of Baballa’s daughter-in-law, of the Prabhala family in Velcheru,  and they had a boy and a girl of their eventual six children (see Figure 3.9,  Samavedam and Kamala, Sriramapuram 1996). 

The new krama-pathi was granted in that same year of 1955 a plot in  Sriramapuram along with Rs. 1,000 to construct a house, plus an acre of land  with an assured yield of fifteen bags of paddy. It was barely more than a ten minute walk from the busy village of Mukkamala, but Samavedam’s mother  objected to the move on the grounds that they would be lonely “way out there.”  Samavedam, however, youngest of the sons, with little hope of inheriting the

A Selection of Ahitagni and Other Veda Pandits 93 

house of a burgeoning extended family, wanted his own home, even if there  were only five other families in the outlying agrahara. By the first decade of  the new millennium, buses, huge trucks, cars, and motor scooters all zoomed  constantly with excessive blasts of air-horns to force bicycles, pedestrians, and  animals off the road; electric and telephone wires bounced in the wind above  asphalt paving; and only those of Samavedam’s generation recalled that peace 

ful but remote 1950s era. “If we tried to walk the dirt path back to Mukkamala  it was difficult. In the dark it was dreadful, terrifying. Will someone jump out  and seize me? It was a long way between settlements.” 

Samavedam’s acre of paddy was tilled by a tenant farmer for some years  until problems arose with Scheduled Caste encroachments. “They built huts  to live in, stole the coconuts, started chicken farms, so I sold that acre at a low  price and bought a half-acre elsewhere.” But he came out even when the new  land yielded two rice harvests per year instead of one. Eventually he sold that  half-acre as well, upon discovery that he could gain a steady income as a Veda  pandit. Samavedam was never shy about soliciting money. “I went to a lot of  people asking for money to build up a career.” Always on his mind was the  tension between going out to seek funds by reciting, or staying home to teach  sons on a daily basis. “If I don’t earn money I cannot maintain this samsara. If  I do go out and earn money, teaching suffers. The two are incompatible.” His  compromise was to start Veda with all four sons, then select the most men tally agile pair for continued adhyaya while steering the other two into laukika careers, hopefully something in Sastra as pandits like their grandfather. By the  time the fourth son reached the minimum age for upanayana, the oldest was  twenty-four and the middle sons—those who were to complete the eighty-two  panna—were twenty-two and twelve. 

When Samavedam went out of the agrahara it was mostly to do asir-vacana, a blessing via mantras recited at a wedding, housewarming ritual, or other  auspicious event. Or it could be to recite in a sabha assembly, or at a large  festival such as Mahasivaratri to do svasti-vacana at the Virabhadra temple in  Pattisima, or a Varuna puja in Tirupati, or to observe a srauta ritual to which  he had been invited. Of the last he said without a hint of apology, “I go only  to receive money and then leave.” He never observed a complete srauta ritual.  He became a Vedic voice for hire and to his last day would go anywhere, any time, as long as a fee was assured. Without recourse to notebooks he was an  astonishing font of information, expatiating on all recent and forthcoming  Vedic events, with places, dates, names of all the sponsors and, most impor tant, all amounts of remuneration. The territory routinely canvassed included  the whole of the two Godavari districts, but long-range forays into Guntur,  Krishna, and Vishakapatnam districts were not infrequent, and he often nar rated his visits to “a very rich Telugu Brahman in Madras” among others.

Occasional windfalls arrived closer together in his later years and each was  remembered with pleasure. For example, in October 1994 a Vaisnava “yaga”  (pseudo-Vedic sacrifice) required 150 Veda pandits to do parayana from 7 am to noon for twelve successive days while a thousand homas were addressed to  Laksmi-Narayana. Samavedam and both sons were there. The trio was then again  involved in a group of sixty pandits reciting Veda seven days in August 1995 for  a sixtieth-birthday celebration in Kanci. Each received Rs. 1,116 plus a sovereign  of gold, fourteen tola of silver plate (approximately Rs.1,000), new clothes, and  silk saris for the three wives. Only three months later they went to Puttaparthi  to honor Sathya Sai Baba’s seventieth birthday as three of the invited seventy  pandits. Again Samavedam produced a rapid recital of rewards: “Each Rs. 5,000,  an ‘automatic’ watch, new clothes, and for each wife, silk saris, two solid gold  bangles, a pressure cooker, free food and lodging for a week, Rs.1,000 for travel.” 

All of this shows that Samavedam was a professional reciter and expected,  even demanded, to be paid well for professional service. He was direct,  straightforward, totally honest about his career of reciting for remuneration.  He was also quite content with his life, something that cannot be said of every  Veda pandit. “There is work and there is enjoyment from work,” he allowed.  They were a familiar traveling trio, a spry, bouncy, effervescent Samavedam,  always preserving yon Cassius’ lean and hungry look, and the softer, more  phlegmatic sons, products of a different diet, more passive ethos, and always  the comfort of an established home in a stable hamlet. 

In his mind Samavedam had a clear distinction between satkara, hono raria for blessings or other felicitations at marriages and such, and dana, ritualized gifts or donations. The former are earned and are always accept able. The latter require examination. The 1955 donation of land and con struction costs was proper. His degree qualifications and his homelessness  

rendered him deserving and the gift was “clean” from the point of view of  Dharmasastra. On the other hand, recalling that 1995 sixtieth-birthday cel ebration in Kanci, he found the presentation of a cow (go-dana) along with  free fodder for six months (“a Rs.3,000 value in itself,” he remarked) quite  unacceptable. A cow falls in the category of ugra-dana, a dangerous gift that  could have life-threatening consequences for the recipient. “Only Brahmans  of low status will accept a cow, even though it is quite valuable. In Krishna  and Guntur districts Brahmans take all kinds of dana. For them it is all right.  But we Konasima Brahmans are strict. We are known as those who purify  fire with water. If dana are accepted, a lot of santi has to be performed, japa,  Gayatri mantra, etc. Hopefully, the dana will not then eat away the recipient.  But one cannot be sure.” (See Figure 3.10, Samavedam with the three ahitagni 

of Sriramapuram, 1991.)

A Selection of Ahitagni and Other Veda Pandits 95   Figure 3.10. Samavedam, left, with the three ahitagni of Sriramapuram, Bulusu  Cayanulu, Duvvuri Yajulu, Baballa, 1991.

When not out on the sat-kara circuit Samavedam was usually found at  home teaching on the arugu of his house. His second son, Venkatarama, was a  quick learner and was pulled out of school at third class in exclusive devotion to  Veda. After nine years on the eighty-two panna he went on for three more years  to excel in ghana, stood first in his exam, and added Ghanapathi to his name.  Venkatarama was married to Kumari and after she joined the household in  Sriramapuram, two sons and two daughters were added to the extended family.  Both boys entered a veda-pathasala in Hyderabad, the older one after a year of  learning under grandfather Samavedam. One of the two girls was married at  fourteen to a ghana-pathi in Iragavaram, West Godavari District, in yet another  liaison between that village and the Sriramapuram agrahara. Samavedam’s  third son, Bhaskara, had his upanayana several years later than Venkatarama,  remained in school until eighth class, but nevertheless completed krama and  then ghana, and was married at twenty-two to Sundari, age thirteen, in 1986.  This second couple added a boy and a girl to the growing list of Samavedam’s  grandchildren and brought the number living in the house to twelve. 

Of Samavedam and Kamala’s two daughters, the older, Laksmi, was mar ried to a Veda pandit, her mother’s brother, Prabhala Krishnamurti. This cou ple produced a son for their extended family in Velcheru as well as a daughter.  Venkatarama, who bears the same family name as Laksmi’s brother, was taught96 vedic voices 

Veda from the age of eleven by grandfather Samavedam for ten years until  December 1995, his successful examination occurring the following March. The  second daughter of Samavedam and Kamala, Visalaksi, was married in 1982 to  a laukika husband, a salesman, at age sixteen after a fruitless search for a sec 

ond Veda pandit son-in-law. Unlike the ahitagni lineages with their fixation on  pre-pubescent marriages, there was no concern over a post-menarche ceremony.  The dowry and expenses for Visalaksi were Rs. 23,000 and Samavedam well  remembers being in debt for five years. “When I buy in the vegetable market it’s  the same price for me as for anyone, no discount for being a pandit. It’s true also  in the son-in-law market. If I say I’m a Veda pandit the dowry stays the same.”  Decrying the change in cultural standards he said: “Parents today do not want  their sons in an agrahara. They want them to go to an office and sit under a fan.” 

The remaining two of Samavedam and Kamala’s six children, born  first and last, with sixteen years between them, Suryanarayana Murti and  Mallesvarudu, respectively, learned some Veda but gravitated toward laukika careers. The firstborn married a granddaughter of Duvvuri Yajulu. By the  year 2000, Samavedam and Kamala had thirteen grandchildren. One grand daughter was married away to the older of the two sons of Chirravuri Ramam,  Baballa’s favorite student, in Rajahmundry. 

In sum, this is a remarkable family record. Before he died suddenly in 2008  Samavedam had taught two sons and one grandson the complete Taittiriya  corpus, taught the other two sons and another grandson in part, and married  a daughter and a granddaughter to Veda pandits. Adhyaya occurred entirely  within the family, so there were no daksina. It would appear that Samavedam  and Kamala were exactly the kind of pair for whom the agrahara was estab 

lished in the mid-twentieth century. 

When asked if he ever accepted a student from outside the family,  Samavedam replied in the negative. “That invites problems,” he volunteered.  “You have to set him up in your house, find families in the village to feed  him. In some of those houses there will be days of impurity. Other families  may think I am imposing on them. So I don’t accept outsiders.” Ritual purity  was a lasting concern as Samavedam only taught when in madi. If a visit to  Sriramapuram interrupted adhyaya, he came and sat near but then shrank  from any possible touch by children running through, and he asked that any  photo prints from the previous visit be dropped on a nearby bench so that he  could look at them later when out of madi. 

At times Samavedam could not wait for another visitation and would  come to Rajahmundry, sons in tow in all their glowing red silk-shawl finery,  clean-shaven, top-knotted, and gold-earringed, to provide a lusty asir-vacana blessing in three-part ghana and receive an overly generous Rs. 500 each plus

200 travel money. For them it was a merry holiday on buses out of the agra hara to the big “city,” and for the astonished staff of a sleepy, drab hotel their  arrivals and departures in bicycle rickshaws were always awe-inspiring con versation pieces. It was never possible to explain to the staff how these people  

live, and what it is they do, to quote Lewis Carroll’s “Red Knight’s Song.” Given the perpetual urge to seek monetary compensation for recitation, it is  remarkable to note the refusal of invitations to go to the several Hindu temples  in America seeking Veda pandits. At one point the two sons were among eigh teen Konasima pandits who received requests from Pittsburgh. “None of us has  any asakti (interest).” said Bhaskara. “The vrata (vow) of a sacred life would be  broken with no fruit to show for it. My elders never ate in the same line with a  man who had gone to America and returned. Such a man was shunned, excom municated. One man went to America. His father died and the son was not  there for him. Of what use is that son? Religious obligations are expected. Those  who go to America only want money.” These scruples in the face of potentially  high income are noteworthy since there was no mention of any paternal caveat  similar to the line that Duvvuri Yajulu drew for his descendants. Several aspects of Samavedam’s life distinguished him from some of the  Veda pandits surveyed thus far. Beyond his successful dedication to teaching  Veda to carefully selected sons and grandsons there was his total disinterest in  srauta, even as an observer; his energetic, uninhibited acceptance of the new cash  economy; and his openness to revealing the ritual schedules of others. In the  matter of perpetuating Veda by oral instruction within the family, Samavedam  would be Exhibit A for the TTD promotion of stipends and honoraria. His life is  instructive in any attempt to understand the dynamics of the wider Vedic com munity. After Samavedam’s death, third son Bhaskara Avadhani and Sundari  took over the house in the Sriramapuram agrahara. Second son Venkatarama  Ghanapathi and Kumari are currently living in Hyderabad. 

### 2 Kamesvari Agrahara Near Nedunuru Village 
#### 1 Lanka (1912–1999) 

At 2:30 on a sunny February afternoon, three men are already waiting on the  verandah steps. After some time, Lanka, on the arm of a granddaughter, appears  unsteadily with badly swollen knees, eyes squinched against the brightness. He  is deposited slowly, carefully into the dimple between stacks of books and papers,  his work-nest. Heavy gold earrings tug his earlobes down, wide gold rings cover  four fingers of the right hand, a gold armband rides as a torque on a pale fore 

arm, and a crystal-bead necklace hangs over a bare torso that reveals his white  cotton thread between sharply pointed breasts. His eyes strain for a glimpse, 

98 vedic voices 

the toothless white-bearded face crumples with the pain of being unwell at  eighty-four, and his voice emerges almost inaudibly but cheerily, welcoming all. Two of the men respectfully request his judgment regarding the timing of  a marriage. Lanka consults a Pancanga, eyebrows nearly touching the pam phlet, gives his verdict, but so softly that one man asks him kindly to repeat.  The other man tries to leave a five-rupee note but is waved away. The third  man, quite young, holds up two sticks about eight and ten inches long. They  are the heights, he explains, of two murtis, images of deities that have been  in his household for generations but are no longer worshipped. “How should  I go about donating them to a temple?” 

Three more men approach, identify themselves loudly and briskly by sur names so Lanka knows them to be Brahmans and can gesture them past the  arugu and over his feet where they can sit inside the more privileged thresh old to the main hall. They are from Ambajipeta, just passing through on no  real mission; they simply want to pay respects. In other words, they seek dar san, auspicious sight, of the great man of the region. Touching Lanka’s feet  and their own foreheads three times each they back away, as from a deity or a  Maharaja, relinquishing the arugu to the dora and the Andhra University pro fessor for a two-hour discussion of Veda and srauta. The view from his bucolic  study is stunning as always, a half dozen shades of green glowing from soaking  paddy fields, coconut fronds, tapioca leaves, and distant foliage. (See Figure 3.11,  Lanka, his rice fields and coconut palms in view, Nedunuru, 1991.)

The elevation of Lanka Venkatarama Sastri as the Andhra Veda pandit  most learned in srauta since the demise of Renducintala Yajulu and Kapilavayi  Yajnesvara Agnihotra Sastri is not immediately perceptible. He delayed set ting fires until relatively late, put off agni-stoma beyond normal requirements,  performed for himself no further srauta after yajna, and allowed his fires to  lapse some thirteen years before his death. The reputation of this universally  respected man who garnered status normally granted only to renunciants, was  built on two remarkable achievements in knowledge: appropriately, Veda and  srauta. Lanka was sometimes called abhinava, the “new” Apastamba, in recog 

nition of his prowess in the indispensable ritual sutras. He had diverse knowl edge of Veda beyond the Taittiriya corpus, including considerable Rg Veda,  selected portions of Athar Vaveda, and acquaintance with the inner workings  of Sama Veda. He served as examiner for Veda, srauta, Dharmasastra, and was  consulted on jyotisa. As brahman he was required to know all the rtvij roles  for mantra as well as kriya. Lanka wrote and published in Sanskrit as well as  Telugu. Second, although yajamana only for his own adhana and agni-stoma,  he had such command of the Brahmana texts and ritual sutras that he was  able to supervise every detail of major srauta performances. By the time he  performed agni-stoma himself he may well have been the most experienced  adhvaryu in India. 

Beyond his sharpness of mind, however, was a manifest dispassion of  soul that earned widespread admiration. In sabhas he always demonstrated  equanimity and spoke in soft, measured tones only after careful reflection on  the subject at hand. When the TTD requested Baballa to fill a salaried posi 

tion, Baballa shouted “Not for ahitagni!” Lanka simply ignored them. When  a tuphan (typhoon, cyclone) roared up the delta from the Bay of Bengal on  November 5, 1995, tore the roofs off houses, destroyed coconut palms, crop fields, and livestock, the whole region was in shock. Lanka, located where trees,  cows, goats, and homes disappeared and heavy roof-tiles clattered down like  leaves, commented like a stolid Daoist philosopher: “Cyclones come, cyclones  go.” His deep knowledge and unflappable demeanor combined to make him  a local legend. 

Lanka’s early years are as instructive regarding traditional Vedic education  as those of Baballa. Born and raised in Nedunuru village, he became a student  of Baballa’s father in Mukkamala. It was an arduous, disciplined routine for  a small boy. He rose at 3 am for a two-mile walk in the dark on a dirt path to  the Bhamidipati house. After a full morning of adhyaya, lunch was served by  Kamesvari, his guru’s wife, followed by the long afternoon review of morning  lessons. After sandhya-vandana at dusk was the walk home, again in the dark,  for supper from his mother and bed at 8 pm. “My father always taught me two 

100 vedic voices 

sloka before I could lie down to sleep.” All his life Lanka kept to this routine  so well established in his brahmacarin period, “except,” he commented in his  declining days, “in recent years I don’t need as much sleep, so I wake at 2:00,  stay in bed till 3:00 while others sleep, and I listen to the day begin.” After six  years in the Bhamidipati house, Lanka proceeded with three years of ghana 

from a second guru, the father of his future son-in-law, still in Mukkamala.  Along with a half dozen other boys he did varalu then, taking his lunch in  seriatim with different village households for a week at a time. 

Marriage for Lanka, as with education, was still within the powerful  Bhamidipati fold. He married Baballa’s cousin Anasuya, age seven, when he  was ten. Lanka’s bride’s father, grandfather, and great-grandfather were all ahi tagni and she was entirely familiar with a patni’s life and responsibilities. After  flowering at fourteen she began her new life with him in Nedunuru village,  where she was to bear a girl, also named Anasuya, and then deliver eight suc cessive boys, one dying in infancy. (See Figure 3.12, Lanka and Anasuya, and  Figure 3.13, Lanka and the author, both Nedunuru 1987.) 

As a child Lanka learned agriculture from his father on land that he would  one day inherit. Among the many shared features in the lives of Baballa  and Lanka was hands-on supervision of crop fields as “gentleman farmers,”

managers of kuli labor crews who did the plowing, harrowing, seeding, trans planting, harvesting, winnowing, bagging, and constant regulation of flowing  water for paddy fields. And both taught their students in shaded spaces among  the coconut palms and small crops interspersed among them, “offices” in the  fields where villagers could also come for muhurta and dharma-sandeha. Field  supervision of the hired crews, whose numbers were expanded by migrant  labor at times of rice and coconut harvests, was “in the old days,” a dawn-to dusk task. In recent years field hands have been unwilling to work such long  hours and foremen have been designated to take over some of the supervision.  Echoing Samavedam’s comment about the insoluble tension between teach ing at home and reciting on the road for money, Lanka recites a sloka to the  effect that krsi (cultivation) impedes Veda, and Veda impedes krsi. “One who  wants to farm cannot be a pandit as well. But in my case,” he adds, “I was for tunate because most of my learning and study was completed before I was in  charge of agricultural duties.” 

His father died in 1947 at age seventy-two when Lanka was thirty-five. He  and Anasuya, along with his mother and others, took the long train journey to  

102 vedic voices 

Kasi to perform sraddha. The property had been divided between Lanka and  his brothers and Lanka received acreage with the high yield of twenty bags  of paddy minimum. Still there were debts, mostly for children’s education.  “My life has never been free of debts,” he remarked matter-of-factly. Rs. 400  katnam (dowry) had been paid long since for the marriage of young Anasuya  to Bhamidipati Mitranarayana of Korumilli, son of an ahitagni and destined to  become the youngest ahitagni in Andhra, perhaps in India. Ironically, then,  it was only this first child, left unmentioned by Lanka when enumerating his  offspring, who directly extended his Vedic heritage into another generation. 

Teaching Veda to the first two sons had been a failure. Anasuya’s terse com ment on child-rearing in a Veda pandit’s house in an agrahara designated for  Veda pandits was caustic: “I brought up our daughter with the ideal of living as  an agni-hotrin’s wife. That worked. He (Lanka) tried to teach Veda to two sons.  That didn’t work.” Baballa’s seemingly iron-clad lineage of soma-sacrificers,  expanding laterally with almost six ahitagni in his own generation, proved  too fragile in his own lifetime, broken by an ill-starred son and then the son less wife to his only remaining grandson. And simultaneously the promise of  Lanka’s continuing Veda legacy, so bright with the production of seven sons  out of eight children, also faded in Lanka’s middle years as he witnessed all  seven enter laukika careers. 

“I had cherished a wonderful dream,” Lanka recounted in our initial 1980  meeting; “four of my sons would know the four Vedas, and the other three  would learn Sastras. But it all came to naught.” In a subsequent interview he  elaborated: “I taught Veda to the first two sons, but both complained, expressed  unwillingness because they would not have salaried careers. So I said to them  ‘Why not be cultivators and Veda pandits?’ But there was pressure from rela 

tives who asked me ‘Why do you keep them captive? Release them! Let them  study what they want, they are good students.’ It was not an easy decision  for me. I made up my mind, sent the first son to a good Brahman family in  Kakinada, a family with ritual purity and traditions maintained. My mother  cooked for him. There he finished high school, went on to Hyderabad to  complete his bachelor’s degree. Grandsons, even more than sons, are further  away, alienated from our tradition. But all sons and grandsons came here to  stay with me for upanayana and to learn to interiorize sandhya-vandana and,”  Lanka added with his special forgiving grace, acknowledging a degree of pride  in his sons’achievements in their non-traditional lives, “to learn to do things  independently.” His last son eventually became the leading comedic actor in  Telugu films. 

A godsend in those early days was the donation of a house and a half-acre  of cropland in a new agrahara founded by Nedunuri Srirama Murti on March 

A Selection of Ahitagni and Other Veda Pandits 103 

4, 1960. It was established not far from Nedunuru village, and he named it  Kamesvari agrahara after his mother. There were only four other houses in  this quiet, isolated enclave in the midst of orchards and paddy fields, none of  them in Veda, although the Chirravuri family did produce Baballa’s favorite  student, Ramam, and later the Sripada family settled in with one son, Manikya,  in Veda. It was the perfect location for Lanka to teach, supervise agriculture on  his seven acres (including those inherited from his father), and write privately  published books and pamphlets on Veda and srauta. Occasionally he would  attend local sabha or take a bus to Rajahmundry and then an east coast train  south to Kanci or Sringeri to participate in discussions of vedartha, the deep  meanings of the Veda. 

Although he seldom commented on it, the percentage of Brahmans in  nearby Nedunuru village steadily shrank over his years of residence in the  agrahara to about 2 or 3 percent, with Scheduled Castes (SCs) and BCs (the  so-called Backward Castes, Settibalijas dominating, followed by Kamsalis,  Devangas, Kummaris, Mangalis, Cakalis, and others) making up a solid major 

ity of the populace. He was acquainted with virtually all the service castes and  the SCs provided his agricultural labor crews. And all recognized him as their  most famous resident. Nedunuru still celebrates two sabha every year, one in  Lanka’s name, the other in the name of Siva, patron deity of the village. 

Before deteriorization of his health, Lanka could talk with endless energy  about the details of any sacrifice or the metastructures of srauta in general.  Of his own ritual life, however, he was extremely reticent. By reconstructing  fragments from many conversations with others, it appears that he hired a  carpenter in Nedunuru village to fashion ritual implements and set fires there  in 1957. He intended to do adhana only, an odd stance since later in life he  insisted that agni-stoma was “incumbent upon every Brahman to remove the  stain of dur-brahmana (being a bad Brahman).” It was Anasuya who later cred ited herself as the motivating force. “She wanted to perform yajna, so she did,”  said daughter-in-law Surya proudly. Allied with Anasuya was their son-in-law  Mitranarayana who actually taunted his elder by caricaturing adhana as insig 

nificant and useless without the follow-up soma-sacrifice. After a three-year  gap, Lanka went back to the carpenter, prepared himself, and performed  agni-stoma in 1960 in the crop fields of Kamesvari agrahara. At that point,  Mitranarayana had gone on to perform sarvato-mukha. 

The narrative of Lanka the unflappable has many contributors. In addi tion to his laconic comment after 160-mile-per-hour winds ravaged his house  and destroyed his son’s house only fifteen feet from his workspace, there  was a time years ago when everyone came to commiserate after unusually  heavy rains washed out much of his cropland. “Oh it’s fine!” said Lanka, “No 

104 vedic voices 

problem.” “He was born with detachment,” commented Duvvuri Yajulu;  “he just doesn’t get involved.” Once during Lanka’s declining years the dora attempted to express sympathy for his three-month stay in a hospital for sur gical removal of a toe following complications from diabetes. It was met with  “Oh, really? I didn’t know about the toe! How did you know?” And when the  supernumerary Sankaracarya of Kancipuram, venerated in South India as if  he were a maha-raja if not a deity, suddenly appeared one day in the tiny agra hara just to see Lanka, not in a palki (palanquin) in the style of his customary  travels with an entourage, but in a car, like a businessman, everyone pressed  him for details on this extraordinary visitation: 

Duvvuri Yajulu (excited): “What did he say?” 

Lanka: “What would he say?” 

D.Y. (awed by the thought): “Did he come in here, right into this very  house?” 

Lanka: “Yes.” 

dora: “What did he say?” 

Lanka: “What would he say?” 

D.Y.: “Did he ask about your health?” 

Lanka: “Ahh” (meaning yes). 

A third visitor: “Did you speak in Sanskrit?” 

Lanka: “No, Telugu.” 

D.Y. (trying one last time): “Was there any message from him?” Lanka: “No. 

And when at another time the dora complained that he was constantly  receiving contradictory and misleading information about srauta perfor mances, Lanka’s acerbic wit had the perfect solution. “Just write,” he coun ciled drily: “sometimes they do rituals, sometimes they don’t.” 

Lanka was much like Baballa in his outspoken distaste for anything that  might smack of veda-vikraya, the selling of the Veda. A year after his death,  Anasuya was asked if she had encouraged Lanka to perform more rituals after  their agni-stoma. Her reply was revealing: “We had our own house and there  was no lack of rtvij for sacrifices,” she said, stating the two most common  excuses for non-performance. “Qualified people were available in Nedunuru  and Sriramapuram, including my younger brothers, Duvvuri Yajulu, even  mature pandits here to study with him. The problem was dabbu (money). Not  enough. It’s all centered on dabbu, soliciting dabbu, collecting dabbu. India  somehow became a dabbu culture. We were content with just doing agni-hotra every day.” And so the pandit most informed about srauta in the entire region 

A Selection of Ahitagni and Other Veda Pandits 105 

was content to be a supervisor and lender of wisdom rather than a sacrifi cer garnering additional titles. And as a director, his reputation and awards  increased as though he had been an actor. When he received the Padma  Bhushan from the president of India on May 7, 1994, he shrugged and said,  “It’s all just propaganda.” 

One of the most appealing aspects of Lanka’s personality was his insatiable  curiosity. He would turn the tables on the dora in the midst of detailed expla nations of soma pounding, for example, and suddenly engage in a long discus sion of karma or God (bhagavantudu or devudu in Telugu), evil, and freedom in  human action. Frequently, observing evangelicals among the Scheduled Caste  hamlets, he asked about Christianity. Once he presented a startling query  without a hint of mischief: “How are George and Victoria?” Did he think that  Queen Victoria (died 1901) and King George VI (emperor of India until 1947,  king of Great Britain until his death in 1952) had retired to watch history from  the bleachers? Quite possibly he meant to imply that nothing of significance  happened in the twentieth century. 

When his swollen legs failed him in 1991 and he could do only the man tras for agni-hotra, no longer able to get up for kriya, he joked: “Quite a trio of  ahitagni we are: Baballa has no ears, Yajulu no eyes, I have no legs.” Assisted  by a son, however, in 1994 he became the only Konasima ahitagni to fly in  an airplane, off to Delhi to accept the presidential citation. Two things con vinced Lanka that he would die in his seventy-second year:  his astrological  mrtyu-cakra (astrological death chart) with a heavy burden of the planet Rahu  on his back, and the deep impression made by his father’s death at that age in  1947. Rahu struck him, he said, with “a fatal illness,” but he was successful in  countering Death with mantras and japa. 

Lanka’s health was not the same again, however, and two years later he  ceased agni-hotra after a thirty-year career. It is called jirnadu, he explained,  being consumed and “digested” by Old Age, by Kala, Time. Like all Veda  pandits he had memorized the haunting refrain that concludes Taittiriya  Upanisad, aham annam aham annam, “I am food, I  am food.” But he was  not yet fully digested. There are provisions, he added, reciting the appropriate  texts, when an ahitagni or patni can no longer maintain requisite strength.  A new mrtyu-cakra prepared in 1988 gave him until age eighty, but this one  was no more accurate than earlier ones and was off by seven years. At his  sahasra-candra darsana, the eightieth birthday celebration for having lived to  see a thousand full moons, he was on the mend from foot surgery and feel ing chipper. At age eighty-three he was teaching Vyakarana to a new graduate  student. “Death is inevitable,” he observed, “but the will to live is strong.” He  did not suddenly drop dead like Cayanulu, or go gentle into that good night106 vedic voices 

like Baballa and Duvvuri Yajulu, but endured through considerable suffering,  including the loss of his memory, for his final two years. He died at 1:03 pm on  Sunday June 20, 1999, age eighty-seven. 

The 1995 cyclone severely damaged the house in Kamesvari agrahara where Lanka and Anasuya raised their eight children. Immediately opposite  on the narrow lane, a similar house was occupied by their fourth son, the one  to whom Lanka had turned over crop cultivation in 1988 and one who had pre viously been president of the agricultural co-op of Nedunuru and two adjacent  villages. After the cyclone, that frame house was rebuilt on a new concrete  slab and there Anasuya lived out her days. The old house of the greater part of  seventy years of married life was boarded up in 1999, opened only for masika,  the monthly sraddha for Lanka. Not until his anniversary sraddha could the  house once again be considered for another’s habitation. In 2000 it was too  soon said Anasuya with a clear, bright face: “Too many memories.” 

As with Lanka, her final years were difficult, and when visited in March  2005 she was unable to rise from her blanket on the floor or recognize anyone,  not even the son and daughter-in-law who cared for her. She seemed then to  be playing Lady Macbeth, mumbling worriedly, endlessly tugging something,  imaginary rings perhaps, from the fingers of one hand, then reversing to wring  out the five fingers of the other hand. Finally, she would rise from her blanket  with sudden energy and shout “Agni-hotra! Agni-hotra!” She breathed her last  on the final day of the year, December 31, 2005, at 2:30 in the afternoon, having  lived to the age of ninety, longer than anyone known to her lineage. 

### 3 Vyaghresvaram Village 

#### 1 Bulusu Kamesvara (1926–2010) 

In addition to Bulusu Cayanulu’s family in Sriramapuram there was another  Bulusu lineage a short distance away in the village of Vyaghresvaram.  Tucked away among palm groves off the main road from Mukkamala Lock to  Amalapuram is a small village named for Siva as Lord of Vyaghra, the tiger.  The soft rumble of wooden bullock-cart wheels on dirt tracks is still a pleasing  sound there today. Only a ten-minute bicycle ride from Sriramapuram, it seems  as quiet and undisturbed now as Nedunuru was in 1980, far from motor traf 

fic noise and bustle, as remote as any village could possibly be in twenty-first  century-India. Long ago, the visitor is told, a Brahman was treed here by a  roving tiger. The tree he escaped into happened to be a Bilva, sacred to Siva.  The Brahman prayed and did a treetop puja to “Vyaghresvara-maha!” When  he finished his worship the tiger had changed into a Siva linga, and the name  of the place became Vyaghresvara-puram, later shortened to Vyaghresvaram.

A Selection of Ahitagni and Other Veda Pandits 107 

Here this second Bulusu family raised two brothers, the elder named  Vyaghresvara after the village and the younger named Kamesvara. Close by,  the Pullela family raised their son, Laksminarayana. All three were destined  to become ahitagni in this quiet agrahara-like neighborhood. The father of the  Bulusu boys, a schoolteacher in Munganda, did not set the fires, but his father  and father’s brother had both been ahitagni. The latter, Antana, went on to per 

form cayana, so the young boys had two older models in srauta, their grandfather  and uncle. In addition, strong influence came from two itinerant promoters of  srauta, as energetic as they were charismatic, Renducintala Yajulu, who had once  been a student in Vyaghresvaram village, and Kapilavayi Yajnesvara Agnihotra,  who was born in Konasima. In April 1967 the Bulusu brothers established fires  and performed yajna together on consecutive days, sharing rtvij: Vyaghresvara’s  adhana first, Kamesvara’s adhana second, Vyaghresvara’s agni-stoma beginning  immediately, followed by Kamesvara’s agni-stoma. At this point the older brother  became Bulusu Vyaghresvara Soma-yaji, the younger one Bulusu Kamesvara  Soma-yajulu, and both wives added Somi-devamma to their given names. 

Vyaghresvara, as older son, inherited their ahitagni grandfather’s ancestral  home in the center of the village and Kamesvara established a separate resi dence for his family nearby. Kamesvara encouraged his older brother to go on  and perform cayana as their uncle had done. But Vyaghresvara was reluctant  and said “No, no, you do it!” and eventually this older brother was instrumen tal in making preparations for agni-cayana to be performed by Kamesvara.  Suddenly, however, Vyaghresvara died. A dispirited Kamesvara and his wife  Satyavati abandoned their plans for additional sacrifices beyond the nitya rituals of agni-hotrin and patni. At this point the once vigorous srauta life of  Vyaghresvaram village remained with Kamesvara and Satyavati. 

Bulusu Vyaghresvara’s untimely death occurred long before he could be  interviewed. The experiences and reflections of Kamesvara and Satyavati  must be representative. Kamesvara, born in 1926, received his sacred thread  at age seven and then spent thirteen years about six miles away in Indupalli  learning Veda from his guru, Rani Hayagriva Avadhani, the same Rani who  was Samavedam’s third guru. The Apastamba Sutras he received from his  older brother Vyaghresvara. He was married to Satyavati (named for the god 

dess of the famous temple of Satyanarayana and Satyavati on the hillltop of  Annavaram in the north of the district) before completing Veda at age twenty.  Together they raised ten children—six sons and four daughters. Neither of  the Bulusu brothers succeeded in teaching Veda to sons. But like Lanka and  Anasuya, Kamesvara and Satyavati did marry one daughter to a Veda pandit,  Sripada Manikya Avadhani Ghanapati of the Kamesvari agrahara outside of  Nedunuru, and he is still eligible to set the fires if so inclined.

Soft-spoken Kamesvara’s gaze was open and direct, augmented by an easy  smile. Satyavati is forthright, good-humored, affable, another ready smile brack eted by high cheekbones and twinkling eyes. And always she was completely  focused on the conversation. Of all the ahitagni-patni couples interviewed for this  survey during more than three decades, this pair was the most congenial and  forthcoming regarding intimate details of their life of srauta. Upon first inquiry  regarding their agni-hotra hearths, these were immediately shown with all ritual  implements exhibited and explained in detail. There was no hesitation about  purity. It was, of course, a period when the fires had lapsed for contingencies and  before they were to be rekindled with appropriate prayascittas for the interruption.  With both there was not the slightest reluctance to share personal relationships  with Agni, nor any dissimulation regarding their srauta schedules. Satyavati, as  knowledgeable as Kamesvara, adds a wealth of information about their thirty-five  years of agni-hotra together, commenting on ritual terms while drinking tea or  coconut juice and sitting alongside. Along with Maruti, wife of Kapilavayi Rama  Sastri in Annavaram, she was one of only two patni to be so well informed, artic ulate, comfortable with male guests, and eager to contribute from her consid 

erable knowledge and experience. Many of her observations are cited below in  Chapter  4. (See Figure 3.14, Kamesvara and Satyavati, Vyaghresvaram 2005, and  Figure 2.6 earlier, the couple beside their hearths, Vyaghresvaram, 2000.)

Over the years Kamesvara estimated that he had been invited to some  twenty-five to thirty srauta rituals, including vaja-peya, paundarika, and other  cayana. For some of these he was rtvij, including the role of adhvaryu. None of  the three or four students who began Veda with him completed the Taittiriya  sakha. He was, however, more successful in teaching smarta to almost thirty  students, continuing to teach well beyond his eightieth year; most of these  students are now employed as smarta pandits in Hyderabad or other parts  of the state. Kamesvara’s Vedic continuity is assured, if not in sons, cer tainly in the excellence of mantras recited in rituals over much of Andhra.  Kamesvara died in 2010 at the age of eighty-four, last of the ahitagni in the  Sriramapuram-Vyaghresvaram-Nedunuru circle, leaving only Mitranarayana  in the broader area. 

#### 2 Pullela Laksminarayana (1920–1999) 

The third ahitagni who established fires in Vyaghresvaram village in the  1960s was Pullela Laksminarayana, Kaundinya gotra, born in 1920 in  Narendrapuram on the Gannavaram Canal beside the Vasistha Godavari  River. As a new agni-stomin about 1970 at the age of fifty, his full name  became Pullela Laksminarayana Soma-yajulu and his wife became Kamesvari  Somi-devamma. He was the only son of an ahitagni. Sripada Laksmi Narasimha  Soma-yaji, a maternal uncle in Tondavaram, was another strong motivator for  Laksminarayana’s srauta career. 

Kamesvari (1926–96), from the Vemparala family, was the granddaugh ter of an ahitagni in the same village of Tondavaram, south of Gangalakurru.  She was married to Laksminarayana there on the left bank of the great  horseshoe curve of the Vainateya Godavari River in 1936 when she was ten  and he was sixteen. They raised eight children, four boys and four girls.  None of the girls married Veda pandits and as was the case with the two  Bulusu brothers of Vyaghresvaram, none of the sons learned Veda. The sons  of Laksminarayana and Kamesvari, now beyond their middle years, blame  economic hardship for this but also, perhaps defensively, mention a certain  shyness in their father with regard to authoritative teaching. Following his  ahitagni father, Laksminarayana had wished to set the fires but delayed until  a private house could be obtained. About 1962 he and his family moved  east a few miles to Vyaghresvaram in search of a better livelihood, aided  by the provision of a house from Kamesvari’s older sister. Vyaghresvaram  in the 1960s, like the adjacent villages of Mukkamala, Nedunuru, and the  Sriramapuram agrahara, was a lively scene of srauta activities, with the  yajna of Lanka and three Bulusus, Duvvuri Yajulu’s paundarika, Baballa’s 

110 vedic voices 

aruna-ketuka, and others. Laksminarayana and Kamsvari set the fires and  began agni-hotra twice daily, routine isti for new and full moon, and the  annual agrayana. Like Lanka, however, he waited several years before his  first soma ritual, finally performing agni-stoma in 1970 with Lanka as adh 

varyu, Mitranarayana as brahman, Kamesvara and other Konasima pandits  among the eighteen rtvij. 

Laksminarayana was known for fidelity to his fires and isti. He and his  sons were frequently seen collecting dead wood for kindling, making noises  in the scrub trees to scare off snakes. He was faithful in agrayana on amavasya or purnima of a harvest month, usually favoring the time of Dipavali. The sra vana pasu he performed once only, immediately after his agni-stoma. No other  srauta karma were projected. 

Smarta employment was not a career choice and the family’s economic  situation was consistently shaky. It was only about 1986 at age sixty-six that  Laksminarayana entered the TTD lists, and then as a non-reciting pensioner,  a vrddha pandit. He and the family were relieved to have an assured monthly  income at last. In later years the lack of rtvij was worrisome and at times his  Telugu pandit son, Laksmi Narasimha Murti, a schoolteacher, would stand in  as one. 

Kamesvari Somi-devamma died in 1996 and took the three fires with her  in the brahma-medha supervised by Duvvuri Yajulu and Bulusu Cayanulu of  Sriramapuram, with Bulusu Kamesvara of Vyaghresvaram also present. Due  to the couple’s advanced age, fires had lapsed some three or four years earlier.  The laukika arani and “the other,” a euphemism for the female kindling block,  were saved as the final pair of ritual implements necessary to churn fire for  the cremation of Laksminarayana only two years later. There were no legatees  of the Pullela lineage continuing “vedam-lo.” 

### 4 Kakinada Town 

#### 1 Mitranarayana 

Like his departed elders Baballa and Lanka, Bhamidipati Mitranarayana  Sarvatomukha Somayaji (hereafter, Mitranarayana), Sandilya gotra, is the son  of a well-known ahitagni, ghana-pathi, and Veda-bhasya scholar. The father,  Bhamidipati Sesadri Somayaji (c.1909–89), performed his agni-stoma in 1935  when he was in his mid-twenties. Mitranarayana was there for that yajna as  a five-year-old, too young an observer for recollection. Sesadri received certifi 

cates of distinction in Veda and srauta, both an urlam patta and a Bezwada  (Vijayawada) patta, something like receiving PhDs from both Harvard and  Oxford. He and his wife, Surya Somidevamma, whose grandfather, father, and 

A Selection of Ahitagni and Other Veda Pandits 111 

brothers all performed agni-stoma, had ten children, three of them sons, and  Sesadri taught two sons to completion with certification as Veda pandits and  succeeded in marrying one of the seven daughters to a Veda pandit as well.  Lanka, only three years younger than this elder Bhamidipati, was one of his  many other students. When Lanka eventually set his fires, Mitranarayana— married to Lanka’s only daughter, Anasuya—became son-in-law as well as son  of an ahitagni. 

Mitranarayana, the first male child of Seshadri and Surya’s ten children,  was born in 1930. He completed Veda entirely with his father in the village  of Korumilli by age sixteen. Korumilli is near Kapilesvarapuram, the home  village of Duvvuri Yajulu, due north of Nedunuru on the left bank of the  eastward-flowing Gautami-Godavari River. At age fifteen Anasuya crossed  this broad stream to begin her life with Mitranarayana in Korumilli. After  the birth of the first of their seven children, adhana and agni-stoma were per 

formed in 1955 to initiate a brief but intense srauta career. Strongly motivated  toward yajna by his inlaws as well as his natal family, Mitranarayana became  an ahitagni himself at the youthful age of twenty-two, four years earlier than  his father. His agni-stoma occurred before all others reported here—Baballa,  Bulusu Cayanulu, Lanka, Laksminarayana, Bulusu Vyaghresvara, and Bulusu  Kamesvara—with the sole exception of Duvvuri Yajulu. With such an early start  in agni-hotra he was intrigued into further srauta karma and before 1970 had  accomplished a cayana and a sarvato-mukha in Nedunuru, the sarvato-mukha demanding seventy-two rtvij to work at fire altars facing in all four directions.  It was the first in the delta since Renducintala Yajulu had performed one some  fifty years previously. The youthful sacrificer now bore the title Mahagni Catur  Sarvatomukha Yajulu. 

Duvvuri Yajulu, a close relative, was a major source of inspiration, and  the two were mutually supportive even when one or the other was across the  river in Konasima for Vedic learning or srauta service. Throughout the 1950s  and 1960s there was no lack of rtvij support system for routine isti, agrayana,  and sravana-pasu. In a span of only seven years Mitranarayana managed to  perform four significant srauta rituals on top of nityagnihotrin duties. On the  teaching side of his career, however, Mitranarayana was no more successful  than his father-in-law Lanka in transmitting Veda to any of his four sons. Just  as with Lanka, continuity in Veda was assured only by teaching the sons of  others, and this continued into his late seventies. 

Mitranarayana credits Uppuluri Ganapati Sastri, one of the founders of the  TTD parayana program for Veda pandits, for the furtherance of his career in  several ways. Uppuluri, born in Dangeru in 1888 on the Bank Canal directly  east of Korumilli, lived for most of his nearly one hundred years in the District 

112 vedic voices 

headquarters town of Kakinada. Uppuluri brought Mitranarayana to a donated  house in Kakinada in 1977, facilitating his appointment as a Veda pandit in the  Venkatesvara temple only a few miles south in the village of Jagannaikapuram.  The rent-free house enabled him to support a family of nine. For many years  his routine was to bathe, do sandhya-vandana and agni-hotra, eat breakfast,  recite in the temple 8 to 10 am, return home by bus for lunch at 11, teach a  student in the afternoon, sandhya-vandana and agni-hotra again, dinner, and  sleep. By 1992 his TTD salary for parayana was Rs. 1,000 and by 1998 Rs.  1,800 per month. 

The four-altar fire stretched out his enthusiasm for performing further  srauta rituals as yajamana. “By the end of the sarvato-mukha I had vairagya (indifference, even aversion toward) srauta.” But for many years he was and  still is sought as supervisor and rtvij for major and minor sacrifices of others.  For example, by 1998 he had supervised eight paundarika and two vaja-peya as  brahman or adhvaryu and served as udgatr or hotr in numerous other rituals  including naksatra isti and panca-ratna yaga in places such as Machilipatnam.  Finally, he exhausted himself serving as brahman in a paundarika in Vijayawada  that began in late January 2005 and seventy-five-year-old Mitranarayana had to  return to Kakinada to recover. 

As to his own ritual life, after some seven years of continuous agni-hotra in Kakinada he allowed the fires to lapse, rekindling them only for agrayana and sravana-pasu, with prayascitta and subsequent darsa- or purnimasa isti, as  he had moved to a rented house rather than keep his own house. But after  construction of a new private house in an attractive suburban area of Kakinada  he still did not rekindle for continuous agni-hotra. There were various explana tions over the years: the agni-hotra room in the new house was not finished,  his wife’s health was not good, there were not enough rtvij available for isti. 

And it was true that Kakinada had grown increasingly more isolated from  the agrahara of Konasima, and both students and qualified Veda pandits had  dwindled away in numbers. When Uppuluri died in 1988, almost a centenar ian, Vedic life in Kakinada was more or less defined by Mitranarayana alone.  By the spring of 1992 he was reduced to teaching only a retired engineer, two  years his junior, eight hours every day, working on the fourth kanda of the  Taittiriya Samhita in krama patha, the sixty-year-old “student” reading aloud  from a book as Mitranarayana recited with eyes closed, his mind absorbed in  the text he himself had learned in his father’s voice more than half a century  before. It was a moving scene for the dora, one displaying the complex his 

tory of a “text,” the unchanging oral Veda in a changing era of print. Later in  Kakindada there was something of a revival with the establishment of a Veda  patha-sala in a hamlet outside of town. The school lacked srauta expertise, and 

A Selection of Ahitagni and Other Veda Pandits 113 

Mitranarayana, after a request for aid, received five students, ten to twelve  years old, to learn Taittiriya segments on adhana, agni-stoma, and agni-cayana. In his middle years, Mitranarayana was a good-looking man, tall like his  father and father-in-law Lanka. He is likable, with a strong face, his gold ear rings bouncing as he gestures rapidly with hands, arms, head, fingers wag gling with rapid wrist movements to affirm or negate a statement. In April  1992 a “felicitation” was held in Kakinada to honor him, with Remella Surya  Prakasa Avadhani, the stodgy Veda-bhasya scholar from Rajahmundry, as chief  speaker. Mitranarayana was disappointed that father-in-law Lanka was not  hearty enough to travel from Nedunuru for this. Other felicitations and patta certificates occurred in Chennai, Kanci, Tirupati, Rajahmundry, and Delhi.  But he is wary of such honors. “All sorts of temptations get in the way of Vedic  life. ‘We will honor you . . .’ ‘We will photograph you . . .’ ‘We will set up a  statue of you . . .’ That kind of attention can wipe out all sense of devotion and  security and interfere with self-knowledge.” 

By the close of the century Mitranarayana, rail-thin and feeling the weight  of his years, announced abruptly that he had only a few years of active life  remaining. Complete baldness exaggerated a long face bracketed by heavy  gold rings tugging at his earlobes. But well over a decade into the new century  he remains active and highly respected by colleagues young and old. “He is an  excellent scholar in srauta, very much self-sufficient, independent, one who  speaks with authority and erudition” was Duvvuri Yajulu’s observation years  ago. And now Duvvuri Phani ranks him even higher than his own father,  referring to Mitranarayana as a tri-kanda scholar, one with universal knowl edge of the essential three subjects: ritual, worship, and knowledge—karma,  upasana, and jnana, respectively. 

He retains both his instinctive sense of humor and withering sarcasm.  Setting high standards in his own performance, Mitranarayana is also known  for his unusually stringent, at times scathing critiques of others, including both  students with “empty learning” and clueless contemporary colleagues. When  he goes to the Virabhadra temple on Pattisima Island in the Godavari River  he joins a great throng of one to two hundred Veda pandits to recite for much  of Maha-siva-ratri night. He notes that “only five or six” others actually know  correctly the svasti-vacana they have been summoned and paid to recite. And  recently, replacing Duvvuri Yajulu as one of the board of examiners of newly  minted reciters of Veda, he deplored their lack of skill: “I was asked to rank first,  second, third class. What class? About a hundred students came from different  areas. I did not approve of a single one! They did not deserve to pass! So I tried to  remain a spectator and let the other examiners decide.” Regarding Vedic Sanskrit  he often sounds like an American college professor grumbling about current 

114 vedic voices 

students who can neither speak nor write with coherence in their own language.  Mitranarayana sees himself as an outlier, one who is both the last of the old guard  keepers of tradition and a critic of all that has gone wrong in modern life. 

Of today’s youth who attempt to maintain English education alongside  Veda he is contemptuous. Huna-vidya he sees as the main cause of the decline  in Veda and srauta. “Vaidika life has disappeared, the spirit has gone, it is a  period of huna-vidya. . . . The generation of accomplished elders is over. . . .  There are no rtvij-priests, there is no eligibility (adhikara) remaining for  someone to become a sacrificer.” Those srauta rituals still going on are “taste 

less,” he concludes, while admitting that he travels south to participate, even  supervise. “If motives are not pure the performer of rites receives no intended  results. He gets only the pressed stalks, not the sweet juice of the cane.” Here  he expresses special contempt for sacrificers in Krishna District who spend  most of their time demanding money. 

And vehement vituperation Mitranarayana reserves for his aging colleagues  who, unlike himself, “fear death.” When his famous father died in 1989 and  required the brahma-medha funeral deserved by ahitagni, it was difficult to find  experts willing to participate, including a longtime friend and colleague he now  castigates without mercy. “By attending they think they too will die. So I took  the book, read it, did it myself,” he said proudly. “Otherwise, without brahma medha, my father’s funeral would have been that of a dog.” It is possible that  the solicited Veda pandit used Dharmasastra cautions to beg off from fulfilling  the request despite the urgency of a rarely performed ritual.7 

In 1988 Baballa predicted that srauta karma in the delta would last only  another ten years. He was close to the mark. By the century’s end Bulusu  Kamesvara and Mitranarayana were both discussing rekindling. All other  fires were extinguished and no one was convincingly projecting adhana. And  the two remaining ahitagni of Konasima lacked the passion so evident in the  Dendukuri families of Vijayawada in Krishna District or in the Kapilavayi  brothers discussed later. 

Although the son-in-law of Lanka, seemingly a generation younger,  Mitranarayana is still of the “old school” like Lanka and Duvvuri Yajulu. He  adheres to the old calendar, referring to the named years Nandana, Durmukha,  Sarvari, respectively, for his performance of adhana/agni-stoma, agni-cayana,  and then sarvato-mukha. And like Duvvuri Yajulu, he speaks easily of srauta life  as a family vidya, practice. Always reliable for candid remarks, Mitranarayana  seems to enjoy receiving occasional visits from the dora and Krishnayya, the  Andhra University professor. Kakinada is a town drained of Vedic life over  the decades and now busy with its political function as district headquarters.  Discussion of Vedic teaching and especially srauta details brightens his day 

A Selection of Ahitagni and Other Veda Pandits 115 

and energizes him. Today he gesticulates in the front room of a pleasant and  comfortable house with sunlight and breezes filtering through coconut palms.  (See Figure  3.15, Mitranarayana 1998 and Figure  3.16, M.  V. Krishnayya in  Mitranarayana’s house in Kakinada, 2005.) 

Anasuya, inside with domestic chores, always remains within earshot.  A  beautiful daughter, Lanka’s granddaughter seen so often in Nedunuru or  here in Kakinada, serves tea. Mitranarayana and Anasuya now have thirteen  grandchildren. Behind Mitranarayana are shelves loaded with brittle tala-patra 

palm-leaf manuscripts, some well over two hundred years old, many written  in his Veda pandit grandfather’s hand, all carefully handed down from his

ahitagni father. “Recently,” reports Mitranarayana, “a man came from America  and asked for books. So I told him to take all these, and he will come for them.”  On the same wall are class photos from Andhra University in Visakhapatnam  that include two sons, with years of huna-vidya behind them, now well placed  in secular jobs. Bank managers have little use for tala-patra in an unlearned  language. “Once,” says Mitranarayana, resigned to his role as sole survivor of  Vedic srauta tradition in his part of India, “I received a telephone call asking me  to recite Veda over the phone. I was reluctant but my colleagues made me yield.  I asked about results at the other end and they told me it recorded very well and  everyone was pleased. An honorarium of Rs. 1,116 came. What a great profession  this is! All I need is one phone call per day and I don’t have to do anything else!”8 

### 5 From Kakinada to Vijayawada and Beyond 
#### 1 The Kapilavayi Family 

The white Andhra University van was surrounded by excited towns folk pressing close to peer through its windows. Something nefarious 

A Selection of Ahitagni and Other Veda Pandits 117 

must be under way, particularly since a Foreign woman was inside with  three men. The sound of chanting was unsettling. After the recording  session was completed, the crowd was told that the dora from America,  his wife, and a professor from Andhra University were scholars seeking  to learn about the Vedas from the young pandit assigned to parayana in  the nearby temple here in Simhacalam, and that the van afforded the  only quiet place for recording. The recitant so generous with his time and  expertise on that December evening in 1980 was Kapilavayi (Kapilavai)  Venkatesvara Sastri. 

Most of the narratives thus far have disclosed the unfortunate termination  of lineages of ahitagnis and other Veda pandits. The recent family histories  of Baballa, Bulusu Cayanulu, Lanka, Bulusu Kamesvara, Laksminarayana,  and Mitranarayana all highlight an extraordinary and seemingly irreversible  attrition in Konasima at the close of the twentieth century. At that point only  the lineages of Duvvuri Yajulu and Samavedam, among all those families  selected here for review, gave promise of continuity in Veda. As for srauta,  one by one the agni-hotra fires went cold like the lamps of a village aban doned to sleep. Konasima darkened in the six-year period 1993 to 1999 with  successive losses of Baballa, Duvvuri Yajulu’s wife Surya, Laksminarayana’s  wife Kamesvari, Bulusu Cayanulu, and Lanka, leaving at the close of the cen 

tury only the hearths of Bulusu Kamesvara and Mitranarayana, both at that  time with fires in abeyance. With the loss of Bulusu Kamesvara in 2010, only  Mitranarayana remained. It is revealing therefore to turn to a final pair of  families extended out from Konasima to the west and to the north, both of  them illustrating strong lineages of Veda, and one suggesting eventual vital 

ity in srauta as well. 

The first of these two families to be considered is the Kapilavayis and  the second will be the Gullapallis in Iragavaram, West Godavari District.  Two active Kapilavayi Veda pandit brothers, ages sixty-one and fifty-seven in  2014, are employed in parayana positions in regionally famous Andhra pil 

grimage temples and both maintained strong aspirations toward ahitagni life upon retirement. Each projected hopeful and elaborate plans for increas ingly complex srauta sacrifices for years beyond adhana and agni-stoma, these  life-changing rituals to take place after completion of temple duties. These  two might be charged with boastful daydreams were it not for their remark able pedigree. They are Kapilavayi Venkatesvara Sastri and Kapilavayi Rama  Sastri, the two sons of Kapilavayi Yajnesvara Agnihotra Sastri of Kakinada, a  colleague of Renducintala Yajulu. Together, these two elder statesmen were  assiduous promoters of Veda and srauta throughout Andhra for all of their  twentieth-century careers.

#### 2 Yajnesvara Agnihotra Sastri (1909–1983) 

The brothers’ narrative begins with an astonishing family history that reads  like the plot of a Salman Rushdie novel. A nineteenth-century ahitagni named  Kapilavayi Venkata Somayajulu and his wife Subbalaksmi Somidevamma  raised five sons and three daughters in Kakinada, the town where Mitranarayana  is now the sole remaining ahitagni. Their first son, Pedda Rama Sastri (1889– 

1987) lived for ninety-eight years. He was an extraordinarily dynamic Veda pan dit but remained a lifelong bachelor and was therefore ineligible for a single  consecrated fire let alone aspirations to tretagni. A second son born to Venkata  and Subbalaksmi was also a renowned Veda pandit, did marry and maintain  the grhya (smarta agni), but never set three fires as his father had done. He was  Chinna Rama Sastri (1904–85), a contemporary of Baballa. Chinna (Little or  Younger) Rama followed Pedda (Big or Elder) Rama in birth order. A third son  

was born and then twenty-one years after Pedda a fourth son arrived. Named Yajnesvara, this youngest was taught Veda by his oldest brother  Pedda, whose age made him equivalent to biological as well as spiritual  father. He too excelled and went on to become Yajnesvara Agnihotra Sastri  (1910–83), Kasyapa gotra, famous throughout South India for his sponsor ship of Veda and srauta. Sponsorship, supervision, promotion, boosterism  are all the right words. Although fully qualified through precocious acquisi tion of Veda in the best of places in India he, like his older brother Chinna  Rama Sastri, he did not accomplish adhana and therefore not agni-stoma, not  from lack of desire but rather from sibling blockade. He could not set fires  because his two older brothers had not done so. As compensation he became  an expert srotriya and the most impressive promoter of srauta in the modern  history of India. 

It is a narrative of filial devotion and stubborn guru loyalty combined,  one that makes sense only to those vedam-lo, in Veda. A younger brother may  not set fires if his older brother has not already done so. There are, however,  Dharmasastra provisions for parista, supercession, in which the older broth 

er’s permission may be sought. Why was this not a manageable solution, par ticularly in the unusual situation of a brother who chose, for personal reasons,  never to marry and become a householder qualified for Agni? The answer was  that Yajnesvara found it inconceivable to “one-up” his elders, in particular,  Pedda, his own guru. Becoming an agni-stomin, a soma sacrificer, confers priv ileged rank. He would have surpassed both older brothers, becoming karmad hikara, the official person in rituals for the family. Even sitting in the same row  to eat would be unacceptable. Furthermore, there was always the danger, in  ritual theory at least, that the second brother, Chinna, might change his mind  and perform agni-stoma after all, even in advanced age, thereby negating the 

A Selection of Ahitagni and Other Veda Pandits 119 

fruits of the younger brother’s sacrifice. And so, in this “always a bridesmaid,  never a bride” situation, never having been yajamana in a yajna he, Yajnesvara,  literally “Lord of Sacrifice,” became promoter of yajna par excellence, eventu ally to the point of being lauded with the title “Agni-hotra,” the name of that  elusive rite whose srauta version he would never perform. 

Yajnesvara’s upanayana was at the early age of six when he began to  learn the Taittiriya corpus from his brother Pedda. According to the family  he was something of a Wunderkind. On January 25, 1984, two months after  Yajnesvara’s death, M. Chandrasekhar published a hagiographical piece for  The Indian Express accompanied by a photo of Yajnesvara displaying a certifi 

cate in front of his chest like a sculpted Roman senator with tablet. The article  included these lines (orthography retained): 

The elders in the family and neighbours were wonderstruck to find  Yagneswara Sastry at 12 mellowing into a scholar with Vedavedangas,  Vidhyaranya Bhashya, Shatsastras, and sroutas on his fingertips. . . .  At 16 he conducted [i.e., supervised] the first yagna independently. . . .  [H]e went to the guru-kula asram of Kanchi Pitham at Kumbakonam  and dug out three tala-patras [palm leaf manuscripts] which the native  pandits failed to comprehend. He laboriously worked on the scriptures  till he unraveled the hidden meanings. 

However overblown this praise, Yajnesvara became the epitome of an  itinerant seeker of Vedic knowledge. He was on a lifetime quest for teachers  and texts. Sometimes in the company of brothers Pedda or Chinna or both,  sometimes followed by his wife and children, he took trains and buses from  point to point. Or much of the time he and his companions walked long dis 

tances, sadhu-like, carrying peanuts and cashew nuts for sustenance, in search  of Veda pandits who might be harboring little or unknown textual recensions  or ritual paddhati. At times he joined the entourage of one or another pithad hipati. Often he collaborated with his good friend Renducintala Yajulu, the  other great widely traveled Veda pandit with constant connections to the  Godavari Delta. It was a remarkable age. Today, mendicants of all stripes still  walk the roads but Veda pandits celebrate their recent affluence by riding in  trains, buses, or even taxis. 

Yajnesvara’s personal acquisition of Vedas extended beyond his mid dle years. At the age of fifty, for example, he learned the Sukla Yajurveda  (Vajasaneyi Samhita) in Kasi, up before dawn for adhyaya, retiring for rest  only at 8 pm. His special text was the Apastamba Srauta Sutra, simply labeled  “Srautam,” and his favored ritual was the paundarika, a type of agni-cayana he studied in a dozen forms and endorsed all over Andhra. Yajnesvara was 

120 vedic voices 

a supervisor of sacrifices over the territory of the great rivers, the Godavari,  Krishna, Kaveri, and well beyond, Ramesvaram, Sringeri, Kanci, Trichi in the  South to Bhadrinath, Delhi, and Kasi in the North. 

The Taittiriya corpus was of course the Urtext, but the Sama Veda became  a special preoccupation for Yajnesvara. Early in his career he had studied the  Ranayaniya recension in Vijayanagaram, and then the Kauthuma recension in  Kanci. The Jaiminiya recension apparently was unknown to him or too remote  to be of personal interest. As noted in Chapter 2, contemporary scholarship  on the Sama Veda is divided, some scholars seeing little or no difference  between Ranayaniya and Kauthuma, others suggesting some distinctions.9 

Nevertheless, according to his sons, Yajnesvara was able to identify the Sama  gana in use in the Godavari Delta as a variant distinct from any Ranayaniya or  Kauthama version known elsewhere. The difference was sufficient enough to  cause a serious rift between srauta families in the late twentieth century. 

As for the Atharva Veda, there has been more than one line of transmission  in the delta. Tangirala Balagangadhara Sastri, Lanka’s source, has been men tioned earlier. He also taught Yajnesvara in Kapilesvarapuram, and Yajnesvara  responded by teaching the Rg Veda, a case of Veda pandit reciprocity in Vedas  outside the Taittiriya corpus. Tangirala had learned the Atharva Veda in Kasi in  a special manner, mornings only, with an Agni vow (vrata), bearing an earthen  pot with burning coals on his head, a wet cloth cushioning the pot. And “stu dent” Yajnesvara did the same. 

Yajnesvara and Sita Mahalaksmi built a house in Vijayawada in Krishna  Lanka in 1975, relocating in Andhra after many years of peregrinations.  Like Lanka in his late years he continued to serve as supervisor for rituals, a  Vajapeya in Nedunuru, for example, in which Lanka and Yajnesvara together  were in charge. 

#### 3 Venkatesvara Sastri and Family 

Both contemporary Kapilavayi brothers inherited their father’s passion for the  life of srauta and benefited from a childhood spent not only learning Vedas but  being on the move with their father, uncles, and others, observing sacrifices  ordinary and extraordinary. From seven to twelve years of age Venkatesvara,  born in 1953, learned the Taittiriya Samhita with Apastamba and from thir 

teen to fifteen he undertook the three khandas—adhvaryava, hotriya, and audg atriya—with the aid of a well-worn palm-leaf bundle about twenty inches thick,  “the Srautam” in Sanskrit Telugu script of his grandfather. His next task was  the Rg Veda, Sakala sakha, with Asvalayana. After that came the Atharva Veda,  Saunaka sakha, which he completed in 1979 at age twenty-seven with much 

A Selection of Ahitagni and Other Veda Pandits 121 

inspiration from Lanka. The Sama Veda was not omitted and he learned por tions of what he claims, in accord with his father, to be three different sakha or variants thereof. It was these that he recited in the van in 1980 recounted at  the beginning of this segment. 

His paternal uncle Chinna Rama Sastri retired from service at the  Simhacalam temple and recommended Venkatesvara for the post. Still today  Venkatesvara recites daily as Rg Veda pandit, one who, like his father, claims  the status of catur-vedin. The temple is a famous shape-shifting site in the  history of Hinduism and an important pilgrimage goal. Normally the cen 

tral image is one of the Vaisnava god Narasimha, the fierce Man-lion who,  according to the temple sthala-purana, rescued his devotee Prahlada from  burial at sea by the demon Hiranyakasipu. But on one day of every year the  seemingly solid sandalpaste murti miraculously melts down to something  resembling a linga and, according to many devotees, reveals the true deity  to be Siva! 

At the age of nineteen Venkatesvara married Annadanam Sita Rama  Laksmi, daughter of a Veda pandit in the Aryapathi agrahara near Tenali,  Guntur District, and together in Simhacalam they raised three daughters  and two sons. Venkatesvara was an aggressive, demanding teacher of the  sons, enterprising in method and attempting to succeed where so many had  failed. In April 1992, for example, he was taking his sons along when he  had temple duty. At ages thirteen and eight, both boys had been removed  from school. “Did they like this idea?” was the query for Venkatesvara. “Who  cares? I decided for them.” Rising at 5 am every day they tackled the third  khanda, second panna, a five-hour lesson for the boys and the father’s paray ana simultaneously. Rama Yajna Varaha Narasimha Murti, his upanayana well behind him, was repeating on schedule and Agni Rama Kumar, his  upanayana still weeks ahead, was hearing this for the first time. “He joins  his brother as an ‘outside observer,’ ” confided Venkatesvara, “so when it  is his actual time to ‘study’ he will have experience.” Eventually, however,  both returned to school and six years later Rama achieved Intermediate sta 

tus and prepared for a career in the navy while his younger brother was in  tenth class with his first Veda nearly completed. (See Figure 3.17, Kapilavayi  Venkatesvara and Sita Rama Laksmi, Simhacalam, 1988, and Figure 3.18, the  family in 1999.) 

By May 1998, daughters Sitaram Laksmi, Sita Mahalaksmi, and Sridevi  were all married and soon all produced grandchildren for their parents,  the eldest daughter with a matched pair of twins after delivering two girls.  Twins are regarded with circumspection in Vedic history and require spe 

cial protection. Venkatesvara and Sita Rama Laksmi discussed, as they

did for three decades, the decision to set the fires and assume the honors  and burdens of agni-hotra. It had been a comfortable life for the family,  living only a few miles west of the sprawling seaport of Visakhapatnam,  population over 2  million, with distractions so foreign to agrahara life.  Venkatesvara, with a good income from Rg Veda recitations, was the first  Veda pandit to own a motorcycle, the first to have a television set, and later  a cell phone. Middle-class comfort and amenities became second nature  and they knew the roles of agni-hotrin and patni would mean a consider able change in life style. 

Sadly, that step was not to be when Sita Rama Laksmi contracted can cer and died at the young age of forty-nine in 2010. Her death was dev astating to the wider family as well as to Venkatesvara, the children, and  grandchildren. Without remarriage, not only was he blocked from setting  fires just as he reached the age of retirement from TTD service, but so  also was younger brother Rama Sastri. Family history repeated itself. Rama  Sastri found himself in the same bind as his uncle Kapilavayi Chinna Rama  Sastri and father Yajnesvara nearly a century ago. They could not set fires  because elder bother Pedda Rama Sastri never married in the course of his  ninety-eight years. 

There is a devastating antiphonal irony here regarding fire. In coastal  Andhra, when a youthful man dies, his widow and her friends and relatives all  gather to lament mournfully “gunda, gunda!” the Telugu word for a pyre or pit  of burning embers meant for fire-walking. In modern India it is no longer the  case that a widow enters her husband’s funeral fire, but so irreversibly altered  is her life that in this stressful moment committing sati appears as prefer 

able option. On the other side is the death of the youthful wife of an aspi rant ahitagni where the setting of fires is prohibited and a sacrificing career is  ruthlessly denied. Venkatesvara confided that his astrological chart indicates  that he will remarry. He wishes to defy that planetary prediction, however, as  remarriage, for the sake of a pure lineage, requires a pre-pubescent bride. That  would not be right, he said in 2014, when he was sixty-one and his older son  already thirty-five. 

In the meantime, fortunes were reversed for the two sons of Venkatesvara  and Sita Rama Laksmi after both achieved certification as Veda pandits  and gained employment by the Andhra Pradesh Department of Temple  Endowments. Rama Yajna does parayana in Kancipakanam, Chittoor District.  He and his wife have a son, Rama Yajnesvara, who lives with his guru, none  other than grandfather Venkatesvara in Simnacalam, and anticipates his  upanayana in 2014. Younger brother Rama Kumar is a Rg Veda pandit in  Visakhapatman and does parayana in an Anjaneya (Hamuman) temple.

#### 4 Rama Sastri and Family 

The second son of Yajnesvara Agnihotra grew up with the free-spirited  demeanor of a self-confident younger brother. He is a completely open and  guileless man. Although he frequently participates in rituals with his brother,  four years older, the distance between Annavaram and Simhacalam assures  him freedom to live his own quite similar life in another popular pilgrimage  town, serving parayana as an Athar Veda pandit in the temple of Satyanarayana.  Perhaps in a form of obeisance to Venkatesvara, whose business cards read  “Catur-vedin,” Rama Sastri, with virtually identical training, although weighted  somewhat more in the direction of the Atharva Veda, including its Brahmana,  claims only “Tri-vedin,” master of three and not all four Vedas. 

Annavaram is north of Kakinada, still in East Godavari District but outside  of Konasima and somewhat less involved in the Vedic life of the agrahara surveyed earlier. The Satyanarayana temple perches brightly on the hilltop  Ratnagiri above a lake and the town of Annavaram, attracting the eye of pil grims on trains between Rajahmundry and Tuni. Tens of thousands of women  come for the Satyavati vrata, a vow to the famous goddess of the temple who  stands on one side of Satyanarayana while a linga occupies the niche on the  other side of this Vaisnava god. By 1998 the temple had acquired eleven pan dits reciting daily, one for the Rg Veda, six for Taittiriya, and two each for the  Atharva and Sama Vedas. Three of them are ghana-pathi. 

With such a vigorous representation of daily Vedic recitals it is not surpris ing that this Vaisnava temple frequently softens the borders of “Hinduism.”  In March 1998 a “ “yajna” inside the compound featured ten offering altars,  two sets of five separated by a great cloth screen into two sala with wicker  mat roofs, scores of pandits working at each, all hosted by Rama Sastri as  adhvaryu. Venkatesvara and many other famous Andhra pandits were among  those offering ghee onto the burning slabs of wood. During a break in the day long sacrifice the brothers described the event, their speech a seamless flow of  mantras, as if a single voice, reminding the listener that they share the same  paternal guru. 

The newer government-assisted Veda pandit economy has been as reward ing for Rama Sastri as it has for his brother. His house on Kapilavayi Street is  an impressive reinforced concrete structure of five stories, all but completed  by 2005 when two daughters, long since married, were still living at home  along with Agnihotra Sarma, the only son. The fifth floor is a splendid library  of more than 150 tala-patra stored in steel trunks to ward off insects, with many  other younger books and manuscripts on neat shelves. By 2014 the house was  as electronically up-to-date as any American household.

A Selection of Ahitagni and Other Veda Pandits 125 

Rama Sastri had his upanayana in Kasi at age eleven when the whole fam ily was in peregrination mode, his father again serving as guru to a son. As  Venkatesvara was directed to the Rg Veda after completion of the Taittiriya  corpus, rather than going on to the ghana recitation pattern, so was Rama  Sastri steered by his father into a second Veda, this time the Atharva Veda, as  if to program his future appointment. 

Like his older brother, Rama Sastri has an open, generous, and unre strained personality, perhaps somewhat more relaxed than Venkatesvara who  has taken on the more imposing demeanor of his father and uncle. Rama  Sastri happily unrolled a canvas bedroll containing his collection of ritual  implements, aranis, juhu, upabhrt, camasa, and other cherished items and  handed them out for inspection. On more than one occasion he interrupted  discussion to offer rice for lunch, the only pandit to open this sacred gate to  commensality, solo coffee or tea being the normal limit for a non-Brahman  guest. And twice he offered overnight stays. 

His wife, Bonapalli Maruti, a truly remarkable woman, is equally outgo ing, bold, eager to display her wide knowledge of Veda and srauta, adroitly  and without affectation inserting a relevant point into a circle of male discus sants. Daughter of a Veda pandit with wide srauta knowledge, granddaugh ter of an ahitagni, she grew up in an agrahara in Repalle, Guntur District,  not far from the agrahara birthplace of Venkatesvara’s wife but closer to the  mouth of the Krishna River. Both Kapilavayi brothers were students of her  grandfather, living in the house six months of the year, and it was Rama  Sastri to whom she was given in marriage. When she joined her husband  to live in Kasi at age sixteen she had already witnessed and understood  many major srauta rituals. For the first seven years of residence with her  Kapilavayi family she ate prasada from various sacrifices, yajna payasam, rice  pudding thought to aid in conception of a son. Of all the patnis over years of  interviews it was the energetic, ever youthful Maruti who provided the most  nuanced observations of Vedic life, frequently clarifying important points  that had been overlooked.10 

On one afternoon in 2005 she rocked a three-month-old grandson, first  side to side in a wooden cradle, then head to toe in a green hammock sus pended from the ceiling of the spacious and immaculate new house. The baby  had just started making fists as a new motor skill and therefore was visited  by relatives who brought fist-sized balls of rice flour in his honor. As Maruti  performed the age-old rocking task she elaborated on the stringent Sutra rules  for the patni in safe-guarding the household fires. (See Figure 3.19, Kapilavayi  Rama Sastri, left, and Maruti (in doorway) flanked by daughters Agnivati Naga  Laksmi and Sita Naga Laksmi, Annavaram, 2005.)126 vedic voices

Rama Sastri is dedicated to an extreme. He agreed to be udgatr for a paun darika in Tirupati in 2005. He had seen paundarika in his childhood and youth  but had not observed one for twenty years and was anxious about his compe tence. He commented: 

My long-deceased father appeared in a dream and assured me that  I would be all right. In my dream I was arranging the charts [he brings  them out as he narrates] and suddenly a breeze came and scattered  them, pages all flying about. I shouted “Please find them!” and a voice  said “Let them go, don’t worry!” I asked my father “How can you say  

A Selection of Ahitagni and Other Veda Pandits 127 

that? Tomorrow I have to perform paundarika!” He replied: “Don’t be  afraid. I am with you.” When I woke up I was chilled by this. 

Similarities between the careers of the brothers are evident. As with  Venkatesvara, all three daughters were married on schedule. Sita Nagalaksmi,  having achieved a bachelor of commerce degree in computer sciences and  employment as an English teacher, married a Veda pandit in Bapatla village,  Guntur District. She is an exceptionally beautiful young woman with a mel 

lifluous voice for singing devotional hymns. Agnivati Nagalaksmi, three years  younger, married a Veda pandit from Draksarama and now lives in Vijayawada.  Svaha Devi, youngest daughter and the only one to remain in East Godavari  District, was married at age eleven in 1998 to a Smarta Brahman, a former stu 

dent of her father from Elesvaram. The momentous news in 2005 was the deci sion announced by Sita Nagalaksmi that she and her husband, Pavan Kumar  Sarma, a Veda pandit in the Bhavanarayana temple in Bapatla, Guntur District,  were ready to set the fires for adhana. A decade later they are still waiting for  

Rama Sastri himself to set fires, now planned for his retirement date in 2016. Agnihotra Sarma, after his upanayana in May 1998, did agni-karya at home  (see Figure 2.3, Kapilavayi Agnihotra Sarma doing agni-karya with a fire pot,  Annavaram, 2005). Also in the image of his father, he began to assume rtvij roles at a young age. At fourteen, while in ninth class in school and moving  up to padam in the Taittiriya corpus he served as prastatr in the Tirupati paun darika in which his father was udgatr and his uncle Venkatesvara was hotr.  Earlier he had been subrahmanya for an agni-stoma with his acquisition of rit ual roles well under way. By 2014 he achieved two titles, Sama Veda teacher in  the Bapatla Sankara Vidyalayam and Yajur Veda pandit doing parayana there.  The hopeful srauta lineage continues with his son, Rama Sastri and Maruti’s  grandson, Maruti Rama Yajnesvara. 

#### 5 Srauta-kaksa, Ritual Rivalry 

Over several decades both contemporary Kapilavayi brothers have narrated with out hesitation the ritual rivalry in which their father was engaged. What is termed  srauta-kaksa, rivalry in both performance and knowledge of srauta, is as old as  the rituals.11 The expectation of a great many texts, the new or full-moon sacrifice  every fortnight, for example, is that the sacrificer has enemies, one adversary  in particular who is to be brought to mind. For the Kapilavayi family it is the  Dendukuris of Vijayawada, Krishna District, who serve this age-old function, par ticularly after Yajnesvara built his house there in 1975. Evidence of this divisive  relationship comes mainly from debates in assemblies that occurred long ago. 

128 vedic voices 

Only the Kapilavayi side of these verbal combats is known and mentioned here;  no doubt the Dendukuri case would be weighted quite in another direction. Several matters have been fissiparous. Kapilavayis claim that Dendukuris  failed to invite anyone from Konasima to a particular sacrifice and were there fore shunned when Dendukuri requests were made for rtvij. Forced to turn  to Daksina (southern, i.e., Tamil Nadu) pandits, they eventually introduced a  southern gana of the Sama Veda to replace the traditional one that Yajnesvara  taught to his sons and recommended generally as the “Andhra” gana. “How  could we use someone else’s gana?” the Kapilavayis demand. Another bone of contention had to do with multiple sacrifices, whether or  not two can be performed in the same area simultaneously. Yajnesvara said  yes with qualifications: the sacrificers may not be related or friends, the two  venues must be separated by a river or hill and beyond earshot of one another.  Some topics were presented to the Swami at Kanci pitha and, according to the  Kapilavayi account, he accepted the textual evidence supplied by Yajnesvara. Here the narrative turns deadly. It is claimed that abhi-cara was employed  against both Yajnesvara and Lanka, the latter having sided with Yajnesvara in  the dispute. Lanka became seriously ill according to the Kapilavayis, employed  countermeasures, probably mantras from the Atharva Veda, and survived.  Yajnesvara also fell ill but despite last-minute awareness of the source of his  affliction, abhi-cara, he was defenseless and died at the age of seventy-four in  November 1983. Animosity lives on a generation later in this Andhra version  of Hatfields versus McCoys. 

Over the years other issues have been mentioned and these are of inter est in the history of Vedic practice. From the Kapilavayi side is the charge that  some Dendukuri rtvij are ineligible for performance because they did not marry  pre-pubertal brides. A  broader charge is that the Dendukuris have created a  “business” (inserting the English word) out of srauta, spending their time solic iting money for sacrifices without considering their transcendent value and per forming abbreviated rites in less than half the time required in order to pad their  resumes. The Dendukuris could no doubt reply that the very thin srauta record  of Konasima in recent years has produced resentment, essentially sour grapes.  But once a multigenerational rivalry is in motion consequences radiate outward  in the form of alliances, rejections, and manifold marital liaisons. 

For example, the Dendukuris contributed to the financing of Duvvuri  Yajulu’s paundarika, thus co-opting him as ally but further alienating others  in Sriramapuram and Nedunuru. Yajulu was strategically “bought,” declared  one elder pandit who is neither a Kapilavayi nor a Dendukuri. He described  srauta-kaksa as “all politics.” Of course, marriage is also understood by some as  “all politics,” and complicated multigeneration marital alliances have further  added to the dynamics of rival factions. Both the Duvvuris and the Dendukuris 

A Selection of Ahitagni and Other Veda Pandits 129 

have multiple marriage arrangements with the Gullapallis, the West Godavari  family surveyed next in this account. As an old Arab proverb has it, “the enemy  of my enemy is my friend,” and friends are always in short supply. 

In March 2005 the dora paid a visit to the Dendukuris in Vijayawada  along with Duvvuri Yajulu’s grandson, Sita Ram Sastry, who was warmly  greeted amid high praise of his “fifteen-generation” Vedic ancestry  (Dendukuris claiming only ten generations on their resumés). It was a  remarkable occasion, entering the little house smack up against a cinema  hall on a crowded lane of an expansive, noisy city and finding not one but  two tretagni hearths in action, one of Dendukuri Agnihotra Somayaji, the  other of his second son, Laksminarasimha Somayajulu. (See Figure 3.20,

Dendukuri Agnihotra Somayaji and son Laksminarasimha Somayajulu,  both agnihotrin, and Figure 3.21, their two hearths in one small room,  Vijayawada, 2005.) Immediately, Sanskrit and Telugu books and palm leaf manuscripts emerged from great plastic bags, professionally xeroxed  color copies of impressive resumés were distributed, expensive albums  

A Selection of Ahitagni and Other Veda Pandits 131 

of hundreds of color photos of sacrifices were passed, and, as anticipated,  requests were made for substantial rupee or dollar funds to continue regu lar isti and upcoming major srauta sacrifices. 

These requests were renewed not once but over and over. It was not the  aparigraha ambiance surrounding Sita Ram Sastri or Baballa, Lanka, Yajulu,  Mitranarayana, and others in Konasima. The subject of srauta-kaksa with the  Kapilavayis never surfaced through all the blatant demands for money. In  an attempt to enter the Dendukuri mind a perspective is recognizable: World 

maintaining sacrifices must be perpetuated and to that end solicitation of funds,  an age-old requisite, is not for personal gain but for yajna. For the dora, being  seen and pressured only as an ATM machine was an uncomfortable situation. 

Nevertheless, it was readily apparent that a research focus on Vijayawada  rather than Konasima would have resulted in quite a different account. The  critical srauta period for the latter was drawing to a close in the 1980s whereas it  was still building in Vijayawada, 180 miles to the west. By late 2005 Dendukuri  Senior reported that there were twenty ahitagni in Krishna District, twelve of  them in Vijayawada, including the two nitya-agnihotrin Dendukuris and mem 

bers of the Renducintala, Visnubhatla, Kappagantulu, Madduri, and other  families. After his 1965 agni-stoma in Vijayawada, Dendukuri Agnihotra’s  aggressive pursuit of srauta surged in the 1990s and earned him the title  “Bahu-yaji.” A vaja-peya, sarvato-mukha, aruna-ketuka, three paundarika, and  other rituals shine from his resume pages. He taught all three sons, married  both daughters to Veda pandits, founded a sabha, and is clearly a pivotal main 

stay of Krishna Delta Vedic life. 

Although he counts him as adversary, Kapilavayi Venkatesvara nevertheless  grants Dendukuri Senior full credit for “competence in all eighteen rtvij roles,  like Lanka.” A small, nervous man, Dendukuri Agnihotra, constantly leaving  the crowded room to talk on his cell phone while leaning over the adjacent  agni-hotra hearths, appears driven to excel in a competitive family environment.  His grandfather, father, and older brother Paundarika Yajulu all became ahitagni.  His father decided to trade their quiet village Nallapadu in Guntur District for  the boisterous hub of Vijayawada. Agnihotra, despite diabetes and joint pains,  is determined to surpass all of their records, not to mention the hallmarks of  twentieth-century greats such as Kapilavayi Yajnesvara and Renducintala Yajulu. 

To return to the Godavari Delta once again, it would appear that any revival  of srauta traditions there will depend on the intentions of the Annavaram  Kapilavayi and Duvvuri Phani lineages. Kapilavayi Venkatesvara, now without a  wife, has given permission to younger brother Rama Sastri to go ahead of him  with fire setting and then agni-stoma, which are planned for the same day. Rama  Sastri and Maruti hope to proceed in 2016 when he turns sixty and retires from

Annavaram temple service. When Rama Sastri and Maruti establish fires, then  daughter Sita Nagalaksmi and husband Pavan Kumar Sarma in Guntur District  will proceed to do the same. In Annavaram, in addition to son Agnihotra, a reli able network of pandits for assistance remains in the temple area. Venkatesvara  once compared routine isti to a cricket match, assembling the right players and  getting them onto the field in time. While awaiting his own ritual entry to srauta routines Rama Sastri continues to aid others. In February–March 2014 his tem ple authorities sent him to Madirajugoduru village in Nellore District to advise  in proceedings for another vyudha paundarika, this time with Renducintala  Krishna Cayanulu as yajamana. (See Figure 3.22, the Kapilavayi brothers,  Simhacalam, 2014.) It now remains to survey one more family, the Gullapallis  of West Godavari District, a lineage with strong ties to Konasima. 

### 6 Iragavaram Village 

#### 1 The Gullapalli Family 

Well west of the Konasima agrahara is a space of riverine indecision where the  great current again hesitates in a floodplain before proceeding on two wide  

A Selection of Ahitagni and Other Veda Pandits 133 

courses. Toward the center of the delta, the Godavari-Vasistha’s eastern neigh bor is the winding Godavari-Vainateya, named for Vainateya or Garuda, son  of Vinata. Until modern bridges spanned these two channels of the Godavari  this water was impossible to cross except by sturdy ferries in calm seasons.  Modern political geography has a label for the region off the right bank of the  

Vasistha, West Godavari District, with headquarters in Eluru. To the eye of the traveler who proceeds westward, however, this  river-and-canal-laced land of rice grids, coconut palms, sugarcane, turmeric,  chili peppers, and tapioca looks exactly the same as East Godavari District. The  birds are here as well, white crane sentinels spaced across the flooded paddy  fields and astonishing blue flashes of the pallapitta. To ancient and medieval  settlers who cultivated the soil, sought pastures for livestock, harvested the  trees, and alternately fled or fought maverick streams, it was the delta, a vast  unruly triangle that somehow redesigned itself with monstrously swollen  waters every June, July, and August. It was terrain exactly like the powerful  goddesses who hovered about, those who could nurture and protect like gentle  mothers, or strike fiercely like wrathful hags and destroy everyone. Sudden  super-abundances of water, as well as periodic drought, epidemic disease, or  cyclone, were among the manifold faces of devastation. The dreadful tsunami  that drowned more than 232,000 people on one day, December 26, 2004, was  a shock when it hit the subcontinent well south of the delta, but similar attacks  by cyclones have always—always—shadowed living memory. Closest to Konasima is Tanuku Taluk, centered on the town of Tanuku,  almost within sight of the Vasistha-Godavari. More than a dozen prolific  Veda pandit families live today in the town and surrounding villages such as  Iragavaram, Juttiga, Nidadavolu, Khandavalli, Siddhantam, Kanuru agrahara,  and Mukkamala (a name identical to the East Godavari District village between  Sriramapuram and Nedunuru). Several families have generated ahitagni in  the twentieth century. For his agni-stoma in 1991 Pisapati Venkata Siddhanti  asked Duvvuri Yajulu of Sriramapuram to serve as soma-pravaka, the one who  invites all rtvij. But the area is more famous now for dedication to the train ing of expert Veda pandits, including numerous ghana-pathi. Iragavaram, six  miles from Tanuku town, regards itself as Veda pandit capital of India, the  single village most richly endowed with Veda pandits in the subcontinent,  with certified krama-pati numbering more than thirty and about half that  number in various stages of preparation, many of them in the Sankara Veda  Pathasala opened in 2007. No one to the east across the rivers would contest  that claim today. Iragavaram in fact has the look, sound, and fervor that made  Konasima’s Mukkamala famous a century ago.

Iragavaram’s pride in a Vedic heritage is well deserved. The website www. iragavaram.com displays copious albums of color photos and videos of the  annual sabha (for example, the twelfth one in 2008)  that honor outstand ing pandits with speeches, garlands, shawls, and fruits, seating them one  by one on a red plush golden peacock throne. One among several eminent  lineages in Iragavaram today is the Gullapalli family, already mentioned with  regard to Konasima marriage alliances with the Duvvuri family as well as  the Dendukuris. In order to examine more closely the dynamics of one line  of Gullapallis, a three-generational cluster is selected for details:  Sitaram  Sastri and his wife Narasamamba, their five sons, two daughters, and several  grandsons. Four of the five sons were first encountered in Tirupati in October  1980 when they were among the sixteen Andhra Veda pandits invited to the  great temple of Venkatesvara to do a Varuna puja, thereby bringing rain to  the drought-stricken Seven Hills. The Gullapalli line illustrates a remarkably  total commitment to Veda in a close-knit extended family that now, in afflu ent times with assured careers in Veda, lives in separate modern houses in a  spacious Brahman neighborhood functioning much like a well-heeled agra hara. This family’s continuity is instructive in several other ways. It reveals  changes in adhyaya over the generations, it highlights the benefits of assured  employment that ease the period of textual learning and eliminate anxieties  about the future, and it displays a range of opportunities for post-graduate  studies, with two of the five sons attaining ghana-pathi rank. Last but not  least interesting, a striking sequential marriage network with a Konasima  Veda pandit family, the Duvvuris, emerges from tracking the two most recent  Gullapalli generations. 

Sitaram Sastri Avadhanulu, Lohitasa gotra, is now as focused on complet ing his grandsons’ educations in Veda as he was a generation ago with their  fathers. Born in Iragavaram in 1925, with upanayana at age ten, he studied with  three successive gurus, Kambhampati Laksmana Avadhani in Poddagatlapalli,  across the Vasistha on an island-like spit of Konasima, Tangirala Subba  Avadhanulu in the Undi agrahara, and Visvanatha Jagannatha Ghanapati in  Rajahmundry. His education was, therefore, largely within or on the fringe  of Konasima. Reversing the normal pattern, he studied sastra first and then  Veda, followed by vedartha. Exams were passed in Vijayawada, Rajahmundry,  and Sallepalle. Sitaram Sastri chose not to pursue srauta for self-fulfillment,  but nevertheless was well educated in both srauta and smarta karma, and  on frequent occasions others sought his expertise. The Tangirala family of  Iragavaram (apart from Tangiralas in Konasima and Krishna District) pro 

duced several ahitagni, and Sitaram Sastri was chosen to serve as adhvaryu for  the agni-stoma of Tangirala Rama Somayajulu early in the 1970s.

Vivaha was at age sixteen for Sitaram, when Narasamamba, born in 1924, was  fourteen. After their aupasana fire was established, seven children were born in  the 1950s and 1960s. Of these, both daughters were married to Veda pandits and  all five sons, taught by their father to completion, chose careers in Veda and mar 

ried Veda pandit family girls before the brides attained puberty. One son wavered,  thought briefly of a path other than Veda, but then returned to the fold and  made Sitaram Sastri’s report card an unbeatable seven for seven. (See Figure 2.5,  Gullapalli Sita Ram Sastri in adhyayana with four brahmacarin grandsons,  Iragavaram 2000. The boys are sons of Sita Ram Sastri’s sons reciting ghana in  Figure 3.23.) “I thought at first I would be wearing slacks and shirt,” says the  hesitant son, “but in coming to my senses I decided it was better to go for Veda!” 

With all five sons in parayana employment, the supremely amiable and  grandfatherly Sitaram Sastri rounded out his career by teaching all grandsons  after upanayana. “Every grandson stopped English education at fifth class,” he  said with great pride, “so there is no one still in school. All are in Veda only.”  He owns an illuminative smile set in a face of pure kindness, but his teaching  is rigorous and demanding. While Konasima has a rule against teaching more  than two brahmacarin the same text, Sitaram has no such stricture. For exam 

ple, early in 1998 he gathered a group of five grandsons aged ten to twelve,    Figure 3.23. Four of the five Gullapalli brothers (sons of Sita Ram Sastri and  fathers of the boys in Figure  2.5), reciting in alternate pairs in ghana-patha,  Iragavaram 2005.136 vedic voices 

with upanayana mostly at age eight, and began them all together on the fourth  kanda of the Taittiriya Samhita. Leading then through kanda one to three, then  five, six, and four, they finished the seventh in March 2000 and were ready,  save for four months of review, for their samhita exam on forty-four panna in  Sravana masa (August). Then it was back to that initial fourth kanda to do the  text all over again, this time in pada. 

Remarkably, considering the speed at which they handled the samhita recita tion, the schedule of these five cousins seems relaxed by comparison with that  of Baballa or Lanka some eighty to ninety years before. They need not get up at 3  am as Lanka did to walk to the home of his guru and start at 4 am. Their grand father lives and teaches in the road-level front room of the modest old house in  which he has lived almost his entire life, only two minutes away for startup at  7:30 or 8:00 and adhyaya until 11:00. This is, of course after they have finished  snana, sandhya-vandana, and agni-karya at home. Only once did these boys do a  symbolic madhu-kara since their meals are taken from their mothers’ kitchens. 

Published texts of the samhita (known as pustakalu or “bookulu” in Telugu)  are sometimes used by the students for afternoon review sessions or on rare  mornings for review when their grandfather is not available. But it is insisted  that each boy first hears the text guru-mukha, from the mouth of the guru.  A student may never read ahead of the guru. The use of any book for review  purposes is regarded by the old pandits with considerable disdain as a conces 

sion to modern times and the intrusion of an English curriculum into what  should have been years devoted only to Veda study. If a printed text is con sulted, they say, the brahmacarin may grow to be dependent on it. Some would  go so far as to say that learning to read at all—whether Telugu or, in recent  years, English—irrevocably impairs early retention of the oral text.12 These five  boys, added to their five fathers and others in between, bring the total number  of students of Sitaram’s teaching career to at least thirty. Despite reservations  about the use of “bookulu,” those pandits teaching Veda in Iragavaram today  have great respect for their students and nothing of the acidulous tongue of  Mitranarayana with regard to declining intellectual standards and study hab 

its. They are, it goes without saying, inordinately proud of their descendants. Like Baballa and Lanka in Konasima, Sitaram Sastri is aparigraha, one who  accepts no gifts, graciously deferring honoraria that go instead to his student  brahmacarin. That non-worldly stance seems in danger of passing as the new  generation of students has become accustomed to cash rewards for recitations  that sometimes resemble theatrical perfomances. The dora was astonished,  prior to their recitations, to spend considerable time making rupee change to  assure that all received the correct cash reward. The dabbu culture deplored by  Anasuya in her final years would appear to be a strong tide indeed.

Certainly there is every sign of affluence in the neighborhood, a far cry from  the minimalism of Sriramapuram in the 1950s. With the exception of Sitaram  Sastri’s old-style cottage, the Gullapalli houses are substantial two-level construc tions marching along spacious lanes with colorful stucco exteriors, stately col umns, flowering shrubs around the forecourt wells, and sumptuous, attractively  decorated interiors, all of them sparkling, airy, and conspicuously modern. One  has a large fully occupied sparrow nest suspended from the ceiling of the “liv ing room” with birds free to fly out the open windows. All have walls of promi nent shelves holding numerous large color photo albums documenting family  events, five-day marriages, upanayana, sabha, and award ceremonies. When  the dora first entered the nearly completed house of Venkata Naga Srirama  Avadhani, the thirty-four-year-old forcefully shook his hand, a laid-back overture  that had never happened in the previous twenty years of greeting Konasima  Veda pandits. It was one of several markers in the distance between generations.  A very large two-floor Brahman sabha hall named Ghanapati Bhavan is available  to all Veda pandit families for marriages as well as community meetings. 

Not surprisingly, the five brothers look remarkably alike. In order of  seniority they are Gullapalli Ramakrishna, Venkata Surya Subrahmanya  Avadhani, Venkata Rama Suryanarayana Ghanapati, Venkata Naga Srirama  Avadhani, and Chinna Anjaneya Ghanapati. Commonplace are intricate net 

works of gurus and sisya on one hand, or of pre-pubescent daughters and  newly certified sons in arranged marriages on the other. In one case the  two types of alliances melded, as illustrated previously with Renducintala’s  dowry-free son promised in a marital liaison with Bulusu Cayanulu’s daugh 

ter, exchanged for Cayanulu’s teaching of that son prior to the marriage in  1946. For a systematic, well-designed inter-familial series of marriages, how ever, the one established between the Gullapallis of Iragavaram and Duvvuris  of Sriramapuram-Rajahmundry is most informative. As noted, Sitaram Sastri  was successful in marrying both daughters to Veda pandits. One of them,  Kanaka Durga, was married in 1971 to Duvvuri Yajulu’s third son, Venkata  Surya Prakasa Avadhani. At that time the young man was eighteen, having just  completed the eighty-two panna under his father in Sriramapuram, and she  was twelve, having grown up in Iragavaram. Over the next eleven years four  sons were born to this Duvvuri couple, no daughters. The five brothers of their  mother, that is to say their Gullapalli uncles, are the five sons of Sitaram Sastri.  In the traditional menarika cross-cousin marriage pattern, a boy marries his  mother’s brother’s daughter. Therefore, Duvvuri Surya Prakasa’s four sons,  Phani Yajulu, Sitaram Sastri (named for his grandfather in Iragavaram), Hari  Prasad, and Girija Sankar were married to their Gullapalli cousins, respec tively, Nagalaksmi, Girija Syamala, Kamesvari, and Pallavi. These four girls 

138 vedic voices 

are daughters of four of Sitaram Sastri’s sons, respectively, sons three, two,  one, and four. This sequential alliance therefore founded four new Duvvuri  families by receiving daughters from four out of Sitaram Sastri’s five sons, the  fifth son having provided a daughter to a Dendukuri family. 

As noted earlier in the capsule biography of Duvvuri Yajulu, Phani Yajulu, the  first son of Surya Prakasa, was the only one of the four sons to complete Veda. In  fact, he went on to become ghana-patni. Therefore, of these four granddaughters  of Sitaram Sastri, only Laksmi (Nagalaksmi) was given to a Veda pandit groom.  The other three went to young men who had as background some Veda but are  all at present in laukika careers. Laksmi, eldest of the four Iragavaram brides,  has two sons. With a ghana-pathi father, the sole grandson of Duvvuri Yajulu  completely educated in Veda, it appeared likely that one or both of this third gen eration of descent from Duvvuri Yajulu would perpetuate the textual side of his  career. But that did not happwn when both boys chose English education. On  the Gullapalli side, Sitaram Sastri’s practice of multiple grandsons committed at  an early age to Veda, appears to cover his legacy more thoroughly. 

By 2000, only the first son of Duvvuri Surya Prakasa, that is, Phani  Yajulu, had established a “household,” sharing with his parents the rooms  of a newly built house in Rajahmundry, for which the housewarming ritual,  grhya-pravesa, was celebrated in March of that year. The other three sons were  married in their teens with full five-day ceremonies, but their wives remained  in Iragavaram in their Gullapalli parents’ homes until the young men became  established and self-sufficient, thereby eligible to consummate their unions  with sambhoga and begin their own families. The respective age of each son at  the time of vivaha rose incrementally from fourteen (Phani Yajulu), to sixteen  (Sitaram Sastri), to seventeen (Hari Prasad), to eighteen (Girija Sankar), while  on the other hand the pre-pubescent Gullapalli daughters’ age at marriage  was retained, usually about age ten. This reflects on the male side the longer  time of preparation required for college degrees, possible graduate degrees,  and acquisition of laukika employment, and on the female side a traditional  safeguarding of the lineage for eligibility of offspring to become Veda pandits  and potential sacrificers. It is an intriguing gender asymmetry. 

Sadly, Sitaram Sastri’s wife Narasamamba died at the age of fifty-nine in  1983 and he ended his grhya karma, allowing his single aupasana fire to expire.  His situation discloses the Veda pandit’s affiliation with household Agni, just  as in the more formal and complex association of an ahitagni with his triple  fire. Whether there be one or three fires, the ritual relationship inheres to the  married couple in the home. His two daughters given away to other villages,  his twilight years devoted to the teaching of grandsons, content with his small  ground-level home, he is surrounded now by his energetic and industrious sons,  all in modern multileveled residences, houses filled with vibrant Vedic voices.

Table 3.3 is a summary of this survey listing four generations in  thirty-year stretches, 1903–33 for “Old,” 1934–64 for “Middle,” 1965–95 for  “Young,” and 1996 following for a “Recent” generation including those  whose upanayana thread ceremonies occurred a few years after the turn of  the millennia. In the Epilogue at the close of this study, the first three gener 

ations are labeled, respectively, Traditionalists, Selecters, and Opportunists.  The list reveals the continued health of Veda certification on one hand but  a sharply reduced number of and eligible ahitagni candidates on the other,  the only likely Veda pandit in the near future being Kapilavayi Rama Sastri  in Annavaram.

## 4 Becoming a Veda 

### 1 A Tumult of Veda and the Brahmacarin 

Senior Konasima Veda pandits and others who were youngsters in the 1960s  recall the days when there was “a tumult of Veda” heard before dawn as freshly  bathed gurus and brahmacarin faced one another to immerse minds and voices  in ever-continuing lessons. Chapter 2 provided a brief overview of the trans 

mission of Veda from an older to a younger generation and the progression of  the student from his initial portion of the Taittiriya Samhita to his examination  and certification as a Veda pandit. Chapter 3 gave numerous examples of indi vidual development. There is more to be said of this evolution and the larger  

meaning of interiorizing Veda within the topography of Vedic pandit.1 The first question an outsider asks is, “What is ‘Veda’ for these  agrahara-based Vaidika Brahmans?” Their replies portray Veda as at once sym bol and symbol system. Veda appears to represent an alternate reality, Gaston  Bachelard’s univers imaginaire in the sense that it exists as the real world, a  whole world, as opposed to the illusory fragmentations of laukika, mundane,  existence.2 For the Veda pandit this is an accessible world and, once entered,  a usable world, for it is the mantra and kriya that make up reality and daily  negotiate its perpetuation. The dedicated Veda pandit speaks, as noted earlier,  of “existing in Veda.” At the same time, Veda is not in the least demystified  through such proximity and accessibility. Always it retains its properties of  mystery (guhya, rahasya). It abides in the realm of the numinous because it  is eternal, apauruseya, without human origin, a hierophany in simultaneity  inside and outside of time and space. No human can ever appropriate all of it,  not even the self-proclaimed catur-vedin who has become all four Vedas. All of  this speaks to the density of the text that has enabled the two-syllabled word  Veda to command priority of attention across several millennia of Vedic-Hindu  civilization.

A second question an outsider might ask is, How does one “learn” Veda?  In the West, there is a particular educational model regarding knowledge: a  teacher who is a “knower” facilitates a student who does not know in a process  of turning the latter into the former. Perhaps, however, the term “education”  might be exchanged for “transmission.” What is the process of transmitting  this beginning-less oral phenomenon Veda to a living Vaidika Brahman? The  epistemological question follows: What does it mean to “know” Veda when the  word veda itself is “knowledge.” 

Brahmanical tradition includes a prized phrase, ya evam veda, “who knows  thus,” who knows the correspondences, equivalences, connections to unseen  realities. The boy already understands that the fire he tends corresponds to, is divine Agni, and in his morning and evening prayers he discerns an equiva lence of human breath with cosmic prana. He is beginning to “know” as his  dive into the Taittiriya Samhita deepens with constant cross-fertilizing associa tions regarding soma, the moon, altar bricks, enthronement of the fire pan,  and so forth. By the time he gets to the Taittiriya Upanisad and its famous  correspondence of self and cuisine in the great chain of being, aham annam,  “I am food,” he will have absorbed basic mysteries of correspondence and  equivalence (nidana, sampad, or bandhu). It is esoteric knowledge, gnosis, in  the sense that a precious few legatees of the ancient rsi carry these sacred man tras and their entourage of text. If he grows up in or near an ahitagni family he  will observe the application of these mantras in daily ritual life. Mantras, in the  apt definition of Frits Staal, are those “bits and pieces of the Vedas put to ritual  use,”3 and the boy will find daily illustrations all about him. 

The blueprint for the brahmacarin is straightforward. Transmission  begins on an auspicious day in the spring with the upanayana when a frail  boy of seven or eight years has his head shaved before his bath. Then he is  invested with a sacred three-stranded cord (upavita, or yajnopavita, sacrificial  thread) and hears from his guru his first mantra, the savitri, in the gayatri 

meter. So significant is this moment that it constitutes a second birth, the  guru being his father, the Savitri (also known as Gayatri) mantra being his  mother, as he himself is born again, dvi-jati. In addition to the thread worn  for a lifetime (and occasionally renewed in a special ceremony) he receives a  staff (danda) of palasa wood, a symbolic piece of the skin of a black antelope  (krsnajina), and a waistband (mekhala) of three strands of munja grass (later  replaced by a three-strand cotton cord like the upavita). Rg Veda 3.8.4 is a  mantra recited by the guru as he knots the belt. Elderly pandits or their sons  or grandsons will present for admiration today the staffs and skin fragments  carefully kept for eighty or more years. Sons who are quick learners are given  special privileges and are sometimes exempt from secular chores taken up 

Becoming a Veda 143 

by their siblings. Baballa, for one, credited his father with providing him a  secure learning environment and a youth that he recalled with great affection  some seventy years later. 

Konasima Brahmans who wish to preserve the integrity of their lineages  insist on a full five days for both upanayana and marriage ceremonies. After  investiture, the second and third days of the former are devoted to instructions  of the boy in agni-karya since he now takes on responsibility for collecting fire 

wood and maintaining the ritual fire, or fires if the guru is a nitya or continual  agni-hotrin. Here is the youngster’s first step on the path to becoming Agni,  the detailed subject of Chapter 6. His duties now may also include milking the  agni-hotra cow if he has not already assumed that task. The guru instructs him  in proper procedures for two essential rituals that will endure through life:  first, making homa offerings into the fire, and second, worshipping the sun,  Savitr or Surya. The latter, known as sandhya or sandhya-vandana, occurs at the  two “joints” of the day when direct sunlight begins or ends, standing for the  former, sitting for the latter. This involves several short exercises that quickly  become habitual, beginning with recitations of the newly learned Gayatri man tra and followed by offerings to the sun of water (arghya) into his mouth over  the heel of his hand and then scattered across his body three times. Involving  his body again in sandhya he performs prana-yama, yogic breath control, and  the strategic touching and purifying of his body in nyasa. Scores of interviews  for this book were curtailed due to the evening sandhya. In something of an  apology for having not one of his seven sons learn Veda, Lanka several times  would say, “Well, at least I taught them correctly in the Gayatri and sandhya.”  Women of the household may also be simultaneously worshipping the sun in  Surya namaskara, although without the Gayatri. 

On the fourth day of upanayana medha-janana is the ritual instillation of  wisdom (medha) and the necessary memory for Veda, actually a reinforcement  of an early samskara, rite of passage, his initial birth, known as jata-karma,  performed by his parents and the family purohita. The fifth day is a conclud 

ing ritual when the boy does bhiksa, begging for food as an ascetic from house  to house, like the honey bee described in Chapter 2, first circling back to call  at his own front door where he is certain to receive food from his mother. As  the community of householders is bound to sustain world renouncers, those  beyond the first three life stages, so the same community supports the brah 

macarin at the outset of his Vedic career. The two modes of existence, both  celibate, bracket the passionate world of samsara.4 

With his new thread over his left shoulder and under his right arm the seven or eight-year-old touches the feet of his guru, usually his father but possibly his  grandfather, older brother, uncle, or more distant relative, and in the technique 

144 vedic voices 

of adhyaya sits down before him to hear and then recite back a phrase at a time.  They begin sometime after the dawn samdhya and continue daily through the  dark and bright halves of the lunar month with the exception of eight speci fied break days of an-adhyaya, days without new recitations when review of past  lessons, or study of Mimamsa, Dharma Sastras, or other acolyte texts take the  place of a fresh Taittiriya recitation. Each new- or full-moon day, as well as the  day succeeding, is considered a day off. Lanka noted that trying to learn Veda  on amavasya, new-moon day, is like fetching water in a sieve. Rolling thunder  and lightning strikes, sometimes dangerous near tall palm trees, may also be  grounds for cessation. Calendars of astrological reckoning (pancanga) are rou 

tinely consulted to discover exactly when lunar days, tithis, begin and end. After eight to twelve years of this routine the young man who survives the  rigors of brahmacarya is Veda, or at least his hereditary portion—in this case,  the Taittiriya tradition with Apastamba as a set of Sutras. Upon successful  final examinations he is certified as a Veda pandit and his “commencement”  activates a Vaidika career. 

### 2 The Work of the Text 

The process of retaining successive phrases of text, however, is familiar to out siders only in part. The small boy with impressionable brain cells has a calling  and faces a syllabus unbelievably daunting in its totality. True, he is adding  but one line at a time. Nevertheless, pressure from the cumulative weight of  successive days is enormous, the task being so formidable that the dropout  rate is high. The survivor of early learning is enrolled in something close to a  degree program broken into eighty-two “questions,” the classical Telugu panna,  from Sanskrit prasna. This might be compared with a sequence of eighty-two  “courses,” all of them charged to memory. As noted in Chapter 2 the Konasima  syllabus for the Vedic student, anticipating the examination system, begins  with the third or fourth kanda of the Taittiriya Samhita, those two sections  considered to be softest for starters. The seven kanda are memorized in five  portions, making up forty-four panna, or slightly more than half of the syl 

labus. The “dependent” (Telugu parayatta) portion of thirty-eight panna is the  second half of the brahmacarin’s course work, that is, the Taittiriya Brahmana  of twenty-eight panna followed by the ten panna of the Taittiriya Aranyaka and  Taittiriya Upanisad. Thus they make up the eighty-two panna in what might  be construed as the common Vaidika high school diploma plus undergraduate  degree. Tacked on are the aphorisms of two ritual manuals, Apastamba Srauta  and Grhya Sutras, further explored in Chapter 6 on the ritual life.

Becoming a Veda 145 

It was stressed in Chapter 2 that the traditional belief in the Veda as apau ruseya, without human authorship, without origin, being unitary and eternal,  goes unchallenged among Vedic Brahmans. There can be no admission of  a literary chronology, or even the suggestion that writing intruded upon the  Vedic oral heritage as it did in the disastrous case of the Avesta in ancient  Iran.5 Outside readers, however, require some buoys in this great sea of mate rial and perhaps here is the place to launch some quite rough estimates to  date the four Samhitas and ensuing texts, all dated bce. Clearly the Rg Veda  is the original one, its early portions compiled in the middle of the second  millennium with hymns that may have been composed as early as 1700 and  a fuller set of ten collections extant perhaps two centuries later. The other  three Samhitas, Yajur Veda, Sama Veda, and Atharva Veda, depend upon the  Rg Veda and are presumed to have been compiled between 1500 and 1000.  The Brahmana-texts, including the Taittiriya, were probably assembled dur 

ing the centuries from 1000 to 800 and the Aranyakas, again including the  Taittiriya, perhaps well before 600. The two early Upanisads, Brhadaranyaka  and Chandogya, are dated to the seventh or sixth centuries, with a probable  period of composition for the Taittiriya, Aitareya, and Kausitaki in the sixth  or fifth centuries and the remaining Upanisads in the late centuries bce. The  Srauta Sutras were perhaps composed in the sixth or fifth century, Baudhayana  and Apastamba counting among the oldest, with Hiranyakesin slightly later,  these three Taittiriya Sutras being most frequently followed in Konasima. The  dependent Grhya Sutras for domestic rituals followed within another two  centuries. Many of these round-figured dates are contested among scholars  although there is far more of a consensus today than half a century ago.6 It  is remarkable to think of the millennium of time during the composition of  the Taittiriya corpus that is transmitted in Andhra although, again, no one  who receives it and passes it on to another is ever permitted to imagine such  a chronology. 

To return to tradition and the youngster in the predawn twilight striving  to control the nineteenth of the forty-four panna of the Taittiriya Samhita, it is  understandable that he has no more distancing from the massive text of Veda,  no more appreciation of immense and variegated genres still in front of him,  than an American fifth-grade student has of the place of civics or trigonometry  in the great scheme of things. Transmission of the approved Western aca 

demic curriculum is just something that happens, and keeps on happening,  until some light dawns and connections regarding “knowledge” are obtained.  Something, however, is said to occur in the brahmacarin who survives the early  dropout stage of adhyaya and aspires to become one among these rare reposi 

tories of Veda.146 vedic voices 

Two key terms are applied to those who are receptive to transmission: vyas ana, passion, and asakti, curiosity. The word vyasana that Telugu inherited from  Sanskrit connotes not only passion but also obsession, excessive attachment,  even addiction. Vaidika Brahmans use the term in a positive sense, redolent of  prideful censure for overdoing it, with reference to those addicted to a lifetime of  learning through Veda and beyond. The younger two generations describe the old  men—their fathers and grandfathers—with unmitigated awe. Their kind of pas 

sion, their addiction, the young men say, is gone, and may not be seen again. The  old men agree, and speak with nostalgia of bygone times in the agrahara when  that tumult of mantra could be heard at all hours of the day, except, they add, “per haps between midnight and 3:00 am.” But the old men also invoke the Telugu  word asakti, curiosity, inquisitiveness. A stretching of the imagination about Veda  should occur before passion is aroused. In a child such curiosity can be identified  

as easily as passion, and no one today says that it has disappeared entirely. What must be added to an understanding of Veda adhyaya, however, is the  mythic dimension adhering to the space of transmission, namely, the agra hara itself. It is impossible to overestimate. The surrounding terrain is punya  ksetra, a sacred site, a place of merit and power, and therefore a place where  adhyaya is possible. It begins with the fact that the rsi, said to live “for 300  or 600  years,” are still here and can occasionally be glimpsed in predawn  mists on the Kausika stream, the Godavari channel named for Kusika, the  maharsi Visvamitra. Also here are the ancestors (pitr), including senior ahi tagni who died in recent years, who “watch everything we do.” The certified  Vedic Brahman identifies with both, the fabled rsi of the Great Time in which  Veda was first overheard, and the ancestors who have transmitted Veda into  the present day. Some ahitagni provide names of both maternal and paternal  lineages for eight to ten generations in their Veda pandit heritage. Other holy  beings who emerge in this punya ksetra include powerful sadhu who validate  the terrain as a place of power and possibility. Surely, reflects the intrepid brah macarin who hears his elders’ tales in the early darkness of the evening meal,  prodigious feats of learning may continue in a place such as this. Transmission involves, in a remarkable reciprocity, what might be consid ered sound mysticism. The student, day by day, year after year, is bonded to  his guru by mantric sound (sabda). He hears, and replicates, the guru’s voice  as text. He will always hear the guru’s voice as text because he has appropri ated Veda in that voice as his own. The Vedic Brahman enlivens a remark of  Bachelard’s: “By certain of its traits, childhood lasts all through life.”7 These  infinite strands of sacred sound accumulated over the years of childhood are  a single resident voice, simultaneously the voice of the rsi, of the guru, of the  carefully constructed textual self. This remains true long after the death of this 

Becoming a Veda 147 

latter-day rsi who has given spiritual birth to him. And when he participates in  group recitations he inserts his own voice, his guru’s voice, to blend into the  community text. As the text has entered his mind so has he interiorized and  immortalized his father and grandfather. After years of emulation, syllable by  syllable, accent by accent, the guru endures as aural seed, until each recitation is  a re-presentation of the guru. In bhakti-like reverence, the Veda pandit may fre 

quently say of a guru who was not his biological father, “First I remember him,  and then I remember my father.” And it was noted of the forty-four-year-old son  of Duvvuri Yajulu (who did serve as guru) that when he began to teach Veda to  his own sons he could finally approach his father to say something although  he still could not “sit down with him” because that was the exclusive posture of  adhyaya. The Vedic student carries for life the mnemonics of place—the agra hara resounding with mantras—and the mnemonics of time—brahmacarya as  a rite of passage. In later life every recitation has the capacity to evoke the guru’s  voice, the guru’s house, the agrahara, the auspicious territory. 

In his studies of the Greek New Testament Paul Ricoeur discussed what he  perceived as parallelism between the Gospels as encompassing narrative and  parables embedded within them, a “mirror relation” between large and small  texts and the ways in which something passes from one to another. He was  also intrigued by what he called “the work of the text,” a “reverberation of the  narrative-parable on the person who tells it.”8 This perspective may shed light  on dimensions of the Vaidika career, both textual and ritual. The Vedic stu 

dent appropriates a given embedded micro-text in an entirely personal scale,  being held responsible for it whenever he is ready, two months, six months,  eight months, a year. There is no enforced schedule, and variations in overall  student readiness, as noted previously, may be measured in years. The brah 

macarin “makes haste slowly” at his task as all the while he encounters the  encompassing macro-text, Veda, in various guises. Further, he will discover on  a daily basis familiar mantras embedded in his newly heard lessons, powerful,  familiar sound bytes he has overheard in various contexts, and these enable  him to link together alien elaborations on unfamiliar passages. It is the text  working, reverberating on the reciter, although here it is not visual but aural  senses that are conduits for solidification and intensification. 

### 3 The Sama-vartana: Graduation Day 

When Lanka was judged by his guru, Baballa’s father, to have completed the  Taittiriya curriculum he could then go home, put behind him those long  daily walks in darkness between Mukkamala and Nedunuru, eat his own  mother's evening meals, and await his examination by a Veda pandit review

board.But first there was a marker for this momentous occasion, sama-vartana,  the “return” from the guru’s house. The focus was a ritual bath, snana, when  he received the title snataka, one who has undergone the well-earned bath. It  was a graduation ceremony with a tonsure, shaving of head and facial hair by  the barber, bathing, applying sandal paste and perfumes to his body and kol to  his eyes, putting on two new garments and earrings, first the right, then the  left, new chappals for his feet, and a garland that he placed on his own neck. At  hand were an umbrella and his staff. Finally, he took a mirror and checked out  his appearance, makeup and all. The brahmacarin vow of celibacy was over and  he was now free to marry. The entire day was spent indoors behind the pen for  the agni-hotra cow, shielded from the sun, and he could move about only after  sundown and sandhya-vandana. 

Lanka was of course part of the “old school.” Today most Vedic students  indulge only symbolically in “return” since Veda learning with their fathers  occurs at home. The ritual bath, however, prevails and still follows AGS 12.1– 1.4, including the feasting of the boy in the company of a number of neighbor hood Brahmans. He hears himself described as one with “divine splendor.”  The daily chores he has done all these years are behind him and may now go  to a younger brother. Inattention to personal appearance, part of the rigorous  celibate vow, ends abruptly. Well after the age when testosterone kicked in, the  new graduate may now entertain without shame thoughts of sleeping with  his bride. They were small children when they married but, if he got lucky,  from time to time at social or ritual gatherings he may have caught precious  glimpses of her from another room or another house and noticed her gradual  flowering into a young woman. Those not so fortunate never see their wives  between marriage and the day, many years later, of ritual consummation and  establishment of a new household fire.9 

### 4 Advanced Degrees 

The career of the long-married Veda pandit, soon to be united with his wife,  now follows a trajectory with multiple options. The Taittiriya Samhita is trans mitted in several forms, vikrti, “modifications” of the “original” or model text.  The student began with the continuous (samhita) recitation (patha). After  completing samhita-patha he then proceeded to pada-patha, the same text over  again broken down to separate words, pada, without regard to grammatical  rules that alter certain initial and final letters when they are adjoining. Then  he could continue for a third time with the same text in krama-patha, a step-by step recitation. The first and second recitation patterns are normative; most  teenage students opt for a krama-patha examination and certification.

Becoming a Veda 149 

The best and brightest students, however, may take a plunge into the more  difficult recitations of the Taittiriya Samhita, the ghana-patha, for example, a  compact braided form that was mastered by Duvvuri Phani, Yajulu’s grand son, and by the sons of Gullapalli Sitaram Sastri and now his grandsons. Some  may generate a career out of such recitations as ghana-pathi, masters of ghana who recite professionally at pandit assemblies or other auspicious occasions,  sometimes in pairs or quartets for antiphonal response.10 They become alche mists working the sounds, transforming the mantras, and transporting their  hearers and quite frequently themselves, with their rich and powerful sym phonic performances. They do this in an entirely different mode from that  of the specialists in the Sama Veda during a soma sacrifice. The jata-patha is  another difficult recitation pattern attempted briefly by many but managed by  few. Popular among Nambudiri Brahmans in Kerala is ratha-patha, the “char iot” recitation that has never been in fashion in Konasima. 

On the other hand, rather than pursue other textual modifications of his  hereditary Veda, after the sequence of Taittiriya Samhita, Brahmana, Aranyaka,  and Upanisad, the skillful student may turn to one of the other Vedas, another  sakha, one of the several other schools or “branches” of Veda that emerged in  India during the centuries of composition of the Upanisads.11 For “grad school”  there are choices. Family tradition may direct the student into a second Veda  such as the Rg Veda, followed perhaps by portions of the Sama Veda, and  later the Atharva Veda. These students will “collect” portions of Vedas from  other gurus, often in other places. Lanka, for example, learned the basics from  Baballa’s father, then ghana and a great deal of srauta knowledge from the ahi tagni father of Mitranarayana, his future son-in-law, and later in life acquired  much of the Atharva Veda from yet another mentor. In his early years Duvvuri  Yajulu learned first from his father for four years before spending five years  more, like Lanka, with Baballa’s father, Chinna Subrahmanya Somayajulu,  in Mukkamala, followed by years with gurus in Korumilli, Vyaghresvaram,  and Tanuku learning srauta, Sama Veda, and additional texts. The pandit  Samavedam learned from three successive gurus in three different villages  but stayed within the Taittiriya corpus and did not study srauta. 

If the “returned” Taittiriya student begins adhyaya in some portion of the  Rg Veda, for example, with the same or a different guru, he faces a Samhita  with 1,028 hymns (sukta), comprised of rk, metrical verses, and collected in  ten mandala. His childhood went into learning the Taittiriya texts and within  them were numerous Rg Veda mantras and brahmana discussions of them.  Lanka, who learned about three-fourths of the Rg Veda Samhita, his lessons  coming from a division of the text into astaka, eight sections, was also drawn  to the Asvalayana Srauta Sutra, the ritual manual for the Rg Veda. In one 

150 vedic voices 

remarkable pedagogical swap Kapilavayi Yajnesvara Agnihotra Sastri and  Tangirala Balagangadhara Sastri exchanged guru and student (sisya) roles in  Kapilesvarapuram in reciprocal teaching of the Rg Veda and Atharva Veda  Samhitas. So dominant is the Taittiriya Samhita, however, that only a few  hereditary families of Rg Vedins may be found today in the Godavari Delta.11 

If a family member has gained knowledge of part or all of the Sama Veda  the student may aspire to learn from him some of that astonishing seven note  score. The udgatr priest chanting alone, or becoming a choir with two of his  three acolytes, employs the saman, chants in a musical scale, to extend, repeat,  and draw out every possible ounce of meaningful sound from the basic Rg  Vedic mantra it highlights. Most saman make use of mantras found in hymns  from the ninth or eighth mandala of the Rg Veda. The udgatr hymnal is a gana,  a collection of melodies essential for the most sacred of sacrifices, the soma. The  gana generated from each saman-mantra can number in the thousands and no  one claims mastery of all. Mitranarayana in Kakinada, a member of the Pisapati  family in West Godavari, and the Kapilavayi brothers are among the last of the  old guard with a longtime srauta heritage still capable of using a Sama-gana  prayoga compilation that has been handed down through generations. 

As noted in Chapter 2 (n. 8) the few remaining soma-sacrificing families  highlight the significance of retaining coastal Andhra’s Sama-gana tradition  and insist on its unique character and style, unlike recensions employed by  Taittiriyins elsewhere in India. The Jaiminiya recension of Kerala is never  mentioned. At stake are Kauthuma and Ranayaniya, versions considered  by some Western scholars to be essentially the same. If they were identi 

cal, however, there would not persist an enormously contentious matter in  Konasima, the bitter charge that the Daksina (Southern) or Madras Sama gana, derived from the Kauthuma, was incorrectly imported to Andhra by the  Dendukuri family, thus “contaminating” the age-old srauta tradition. Perhaps  it is a composite of Ranayaniya gana in the “local” style. Lanka insisted that  diluting Ranayaniya with Kauthuma elements was a dangerous mixing of tra ditions. Now that the elder Konasima ahitagni have passed on and a tradition  of routinely held great sacrifices has moved west from Konasima to Krishna  District it will be far more difficult to sustain that charge regarding the Sama gana role in yajna.12 

Kapilavayi Yajnesvara Agnihotra Sastri, the itinerant collector of Vedas,  went to live in Kasi (Varanasi) in order to learn all forty adhyaya of the Sukla  (White) Yajur Veda, a Veda known also as the Vajasaneyi Samhita, concluding  with the Isa Upanisad. Hereditary Vajasaneyins are as few in East Godavari  today as Rg Vedins.13 Separation of pandits by sakha is not as severe as once  was the case. Middle generation Vaidika Brahmans remember a time when 

Becoming a Veda 151 

interdining, sitting in the same line for food, was not possible between  Taittiriyins and Vajasaneyins. Now, however, they may eat in the same hall.  Honoraria for recitations were also unequal in the past, Vajasaneyins receiv ing only half as much, even when reciting the same text, as their syllabus was  considered to be less demanding. And it is true that the Vajasaneya Samhita  is perhaps half the length of the Taittiriya Samhita. Unlike the Krsna Yajur  Veda that contains vidhi or brahmana portions, injunctions and commentar ies, mixed in with mantras and yajus formulas, these explicative passages are  reserved in the White Yajur Veda corpus for the quite lengthy Brahmana, the  Satapatha, the Brahmana “of a hundred paths.” An interesting if extremely  derogatory Telugu epithet is used by Taittiriyins with regard to such sakha dis tinctions. Vajasaneyins of the Madhyandina recension of the Sukla Yajur Veda  (not the Kanva branch) are known locally as madhyanna Malas, meaning they  are Untouchable Malas until midday (Telugu madhyanna) when they suddenly  become Brahmans. Such verbal antagonism may reflect an ancient dispute  between the sakha in this region of South India.14 

The Atharva Veda Samhita has two mostly similar recensions, Saunaka  and Paippilada, of which the former is known in the delta. Like the Taittiriya  Samhita, the text is arranged in kanda, collections, of sukta, hymns, 730  hymns assembled in twenty cycles, mostly metrical but containing some  prose. There are no Atharva Veda hereditary families although more than a  dozen individuals have received all or substantial portions of the Saunakiya  recension of that fourth Veda, primarily for personal, not community-wide  rituals. Pandits surveyed in Chapter 3 include Lanka who learned much of the  Atharva Veda, his guru being Tangirila in Kapilesvarapuram. Duvvuri Yajulu  also learned numerous portions, one reason being his need for mantras in  a vain attempt to stave off increasing blindness from glaucoma. Neither of  them learned hymn by hymn in a fashion that might be expected by an out side scholar, however, but rather by selection of anuvaka, portions of kanda,  for specific ends. Lanka claimed the benefits of santi, peacefulness, pusti, 

prosperity, and abhicara, by which he meant counter-sorcery or defensive  charms that he recited to ward off an enemy’s malign intent. At one critical  juncture he believed that Atharva Veda mantras saved his life. The Kapilavayi  brothers also learned the Atharva Veda, Rama Sastri in order to serve in  parayana in the Annavaram temple as an Atharva pandit, Venkatesvara in  order to qualify as a catur-vedin and emulate his father’s record as knower of  all four Vedas. 

In addition to pursuing other vikrti of the Taittiriya Samhita or turning to  Vedas in other sakha the young man with increasing abilities and an expanded  resumé, thinking ahead to living with his wife and starting a family, may 

152 vedic voices 

choose further studies with a pandit elsewhere in the agrahara or in another  village or town, with a focus on one of the Vedangas, “limbs of Veda.” These  texts, some as old as the fifth century bce, aphoristic in style, are designed  as sciences to further transmission and understanding of the Vedas. Already  mentioned are the Sutras of Apastamba, his Srauta, Grhya, and Dharma  Sutras, respectively, manuals for sacrificial, domestic, and legal or traditional  rituals. In the delta these are part of the standard curriculum. Popular options  beyond Apastamba include Vyakarana, grammar, obviously significant for tex tual learning, particularly important in the transition from Vedic to Classical  Sanskrit, and Jyotisa, astronomical and astrological reckoning to determine  and interpret calendric time. 

Less frequently studied are phonetics, prosody or metrics, and etymology,  respectively, Siksa, Chandas, and Nirukta. Loosely counted as another limb  is Mimamsa, inquiry into the meaning of the Veda, vedartha, going beyond  mantras and precepts to contextualization. Duvvuri Surya Prakasa, as noted in  Chapter 3, invested several years in post-graduate studies of the vidhi, injunc 

tions that lie beneath ritual acts according to ritual theory in Mimamsa.15 He  also studied Dharma Sastras, evolved from the earlier Dharma Sutras, reserv ing considerable attention for Manava Dharma Sastra, the Laws of Manu. 

Certification from further studies in any of these branches of learn ing adds to credentials and increases authority when attending a local or  regional pandit assembly, a sabha, for debates and exchanges of information  on current Vedic events. If he becomes certified in the Apastamba texts for  domestic rituals, often a father-to-son transmission of expertise for heredi tary clientele, he may also become a family purohita for other Brahmans,  asked to conduct marriages, housewarmings, thread ceremonies, or other  auspicious smarta (domestic) rites for small honoraria. This was a role that  Bulusu Cayanulu fulfilled in Sriramapuram and one that Duvvuri Surya  Prakasa still holds. 

In lineages of srauta sacrificers a young pandit might be recruited into a  role as rtvij, one of the staff of four priests necessary for fortnightly offerings  known as isti on new- or full-moon days and annual harvest rites, or even  one of the sixteen to eighteen priests in an extended rite such as a fire-altar  construction lasting forty days. Kapilavayi Agnihotra Sarma served as rtvij in such a paundarika at the age of fourteen. Even after graduating from celi 

bate studentship and becoming a householder the Veda pandit is engaged  in post-graduate studies, the lifelong learning that is the mark of agrahara residents who never seem to cease their quest for knowledge. And of course  “the Veda,” with scores of primary, acolyte, and commentarial texts, provides  unbounded territory for exploration.

### 5 The Sabha: Debating in an Assembly of  Veda Pandits 

A sabha is an assembly of Veda pandits that meets in a particular venue on  scheduled occasions, often annually. At the turn of the millennium it seemed  that all the Vedic communities were either instituting a new sabha or reviving  a moribund one. The word, in use since the Rg Veda with the general mean 

ing of assembly or congregation, is in common parlance, as in the two houses  of parliament of modern India, the upper or Rajya Sabha and lower or Lok  Sabha, respectively, the assemblies of the states and the people. A new Vedic  sabha was founded in the name of Duvvuri Yajulu March 28, 2005, when  some seventy Veda pandits gathered in the Sriramapuram agrahara to observe  his ninetieth birthday. Already ninety-four on the Telugu calendar, the blind  and memory-less Yajulu was enduring the final days before his death a few  months later. His family and colleagues wished to found this new sabha in his  name to honor him while he still could participate, even without his faculties. 

Across the wide Vasistha Godavari, Iragavaram Veda pandits such as the  Gullapalli family vigorously promote their annual sabha and post colorful,  lively video clips on their website each time. The Dendukuri family is among  the Vijayawada soma-yaji who send out their curricula vitae along with regular  flyers about their sabha. All are aggressively seeking funds either to establish  new sabha or keep existing ones afloat. Local and regional coherence of Vedic  tradition is much to the point. One wealthy Telugu Brahman who lives in  Chennai is an active supporter of Veda and sponsors an annual sabha during  Navaratri in Vijayawada. Clearly sabha have blossomed in number, size, and  wealth over the past generation. 

What does a sabha mean to Veda pandits? It is a gathering to debate a par ticular subject, often an unrealistically expansive one such as srauta, sakha, or  patha that will draw a crowd and intimidate no one, young or old. Much like an  American college faculty meeting with an announced agenda, that subject will  be broached, addressed in prepared speeches or offhand remarks by some,  circumvented by others, dismissed by a few, and perhaps tabled for the next  meeting. Blowhards will dominate. The wise will remain silent unless their  opinions are directly solicited. Personal scores will be settled, often with clever  repartee and innuendo. Expected individuals will insist on “the rules.” Private  conversations in the back row will determine participants in a forthcoming  ritual, examination, or marriage arrangement. A few will leave with satisfac 

tion and a sense that the subject has been adequately settled. There are substantial differences, however, between a Vedic sabha and an  American faculty meeting. One is that the sabha is open to the public, an 

154 vedic voices 

audience that for the most part understands nothing of the Sanskrit and little  of the esoteric Telugu, but arrives anyway to bask in the esteemed company  of Brahmans of consequence. Second, attendees at the college meeting, par ticularly junior faculty, are more or less forced to be there and are not paid,  whereas Veda pandits have come voluntarily and receive honoraria. The hono rarium (sambhavana) is the reason they are there. 

One ahitagni of sound pedigree had a low opinion: “The Godavari sabha,”  he commented, “intends to promote the learning of Veda, but the President is  a rich man, the Secretary a lawyer, both busy with their own affairs. They come  on the day of felicitation neatly dressed to show off and beat a drum to say  they are strongly behind Veda study, hand out a few thousand rupees to pan 

dits, and have absolutely no other interaction with them.” Others, however,  consider them worth attending to hear different opinions on Vedic subjects  and catch up on area news. There is, of course, considerable at-home practice  for sabha in the continual debates on the arugu of agrahara. The sabha is an  expanded version of such in-house deliberations. 

Lanka noted that three things are essential for a successful Veda  sabha:  upanyasa, by which he meant precise statements on Vedic subjects,  supported by references to the texts; satkara, hospitality, including respect for  the Brahmans, good food, and honoraria; and third, svasti, group recitation of  the svasti-vacana, Rg Veda 1.89, addressed to the Visve-devas, “All the gods,” a  moment of great pleasure for those reciting as well as hearing, patha succeed 

ing one another in increasing order of expertise. 

In its heyday, Sriramapuram, with its wealth of ahitagni and other  well-educated pandits, had routine discussions of Veda, srauta, Dharmasastra,  Mimamsa, Vyakarana, Jyotisa, and other subjects, interspersed with illustra tions from epic and Puranic mythology. As seniority gradually slipped from  Baballa to Duvvuri Yajulu, with occasional visits from Lanka, the recognized  authority on every matter of srauta, the dynamics of these discussions grad ually shifted. Seniority in the agrahara cluster has been observed over the  years and sabha, whether all-district or statewide, carry out the same protocol.  Usually everyone knows or has heard of the principals who address the larger  gatherings or challenge the finer points of discussion. 

Some routine meetings, open to the general public, are also called sabha even when the subjects are more frequently post-Vedic. Every day, for exam ple, from 4 to 6 pm. there is a pandit sabha on the generous concrete floor of  the Markandeya Swami Temple in Rajahmundry. Various mela, mass gather ings at pilgrimage centers, also harbor Veda sabha amid all the festivities of  a religious fair. Oldest and most famous is the Kumbha Mela at Prayag, near  Allahabad, at the confluence of the Ganges, the Jumna (Yamuna), and mythical 

Becoming a Veda 155 

Sarasvati rivers, held every twelve years. Both the Godavari and Krishna rivers  eventually became hosts in the twelve-year cycle. Known as Pushkara (from  the pilgrimage center Pushkara in Rajasthan) these mela bring Veda pan dits from across India, Nepal, and now the United Kingdom and the United  States. The Krishna Pushkara precedes Godavari Pushkara by one year and  most local pandits attend sabha during both, centering on Vijayawada for the  former, Rajahmundry for the latter. Recent Godavari Pushkaras occurred in  1969, 1981, 1993, and 2005. Several million bathers appeared in Rajahmundry  in 2005 with probably a record Veda pandit turnout, although the pandit  choice for a river dip was often not the mobbed public revu (Telugu for bathing  ghats). Siva-ratri, the night of Siva, is another occasion for a great throng each  year, one popular venue being the rocky island of Pattisima (Pattesam) in the  Godavari, upriver from Rajahmundry about halfway to Polavaram. A sabha there draws as many as 200 pandits to chant the svasti-vacana and other texts. 

On the other hand, even the smallest of villages may hold a sabha. To cite  an example, on the first two days of November 1980 a Brahman householder  sponsored an assembly in his house in Munganda, a village with a popula tion of 3,000 close by the divide between the Vasistha and Vainateya branches  of the Godavari. A great red carpet was spread on one side of the pit in the  atrium typical of sumptuous village houses. Intentionally left visible to the  audience of adults and some twenty children was the open granary with its  huge yellow mound of husked paddy. A dozen pandits invited from this and  nearby villages wore the tri-pundra forehead mark. Exposition of Veda, Veda 

pravacana, provided the introit, followed by recitations and a chance to show  off prowess in pada, krama, jata, and ghana patha of selected portions of the  Taittiriya Samhita. As usual, ghana was the piece de resistance, with four pan dits facing four others in team antiphony. Then discussions began, some in  Sanskrit, most in Telugu, with Vedic texts and traditions leading to a focus on  local antyesti and sraddha practices concerning funerals and ancestor worship,  respectively. The session lasted five and a half hours. Every Sravana month,  dark or bright lunar half, this village, like many others, provides such a sabha. Sometimes it is linked to the beginning of a local student’s Vedic instruction  

in which case it occurs on a full-moon day after his upanayana. Nedunuru, also a small village, has two sabha every year, one since 1980  to honor the village god, Chennamalaisvara (Siva), the other, begun in 1986,  named for the resident ahitagni Lanka. Another considerably larger sabha occurred in the town of Palakollu on the first of January 1988 on Mukkoti  Ekadasi, “three crores (of gods) eleventh,” also known as Visnu’s Eleventh.  About a hundred pandits and a dozen brahmacarin students attended from 3  to 7 pm with brief excuses for sandhya-vandana outside the hall at sundown.156 vedic voices 

They came from East and West Godavari, Krishna, and Guntur Districts and  were seated and honored in a hierarchy of specialties: srauta, veda, smarta,  puranika, brahmacarin. Honoraria came as money in envelopes from cloth  bags and fruit from baskets. At one point an elderly woman circulated among  the students and presented each with coins. 

Frequently, the congregation of pandits for a sabha is the occasion for examina tions of students in Veda. The Rajahmundry Parishad, for example, draws together  pandit examiners from Gangalakurru, Annavaram, Kottapeta, Machilipatnam,  and of course the villages containing agrahara. Sriramapuram, Vyaghresvaram,  Mukkamala, Iragavaram, Kakinada, Samalakota, and Amalapuram have all been  selected for joint East and West Godavari District sabha-examination meetings  usually lasting two or three days, including business meetings for the selection  of secretaries, treasurers, and other Parishad officers. 

As the number of Veda sabha continues to increase so does the range of  opportunity for honoraria, and many pandits track the schedules for increas ing their livelihood. Samavedam, for example, knew the venues for all upcom ing sabha within a hundred miles or more and took both sons along. Before  there was a parayana scheme, honoraria from sabha and recitations at mar riage ceremonies or new house openings were the elder Samavedam’s prin cipal source of income. For the diligent student Duvvuri Phani in the late  1990s, not yet employed in parayana, with one child and another on the way,  sambhavana became a series of stipends upon which his survival depended.  At that time a standard honorarium was Rs. 400 to 500, about $10 to $12.50.  Elderly pandits attend as long as their health permits travel by train and bus. 

Ahitagni have been of two minds regarding honoraria. Baballa flatly  refused any and all, disdaining them as veda-vikraya, the selling of the Veda,  and therefore did not attend sabha. His an-ahitagni grandson Prasad still  refuses invitations today out of respect for Baballa. Lanka relied on sambha 

vana for much of his career in order to keep from sinking under debts, but  later dismissed all except for travel and maintenance funding, understand ing correctly that his knowledge and experience were often crucial to debates  on srauta. Frequently he went south to Sringeri, occasionally to Kanci, for  larger sabha. Mitranarayana, for his part, remarks today regarding sabha and  yajna: “In the past we did not stir out of our villages. But now the activity of  Veda is diversified, so we constantly receive invitations to go to other places.  I enjoyed the opportunities to go to Hyderabad, Delhi, Ujjaini, and other cit ies.” Young, newly certified Veda pandits entering16 the grhastha stage of life  and looking forward to opportunities in parayana and a steady income in a  lively cash economy, heartily agree with him. The householder’s way of life is  the focus of Chapter 5.

## 5 Becoming a Householder 

### 1 The Voices of Women 

The bridge over the Billakurru canal is packed tight with all imaginable colors  flowing in brilliant sun, a kaleidoscope of scintillating saris and glistening  bangles on girls and women thronging the road toward Jaganathota. It is the  long-awaited Tadithota festival, an assembly of gods from fourteen villages  in a spacious palm orchard some three miles from Sriramapuram. Shouting  troupes of men lug giant prabha, garlanded bamboo and papier-mâché floats  for every village god and goddess, each grand enough to carry several riders  along. Formerly they were thirty feet tall with masts strapped on bullock carts  but the new god of electric wires reduced their vertical scale. As if to compen sate, each village increased its amplified drum-and-bugle legion in competi 

tive cacophony. Men are always out and about but today in this local Mardi  Gras it is the joyous release of girls from school and auspicious wives from  the confines of house and lane. Their best cotton frocks or silk saris and lus trous oiled and jasmined braids command almost as much attention as their  broadly smiling faces. 

Girls and women—wives, mothers, daughters, daughters-in-law—have  appeared only briefly in Chapter 4 on textual studies since the upanayana and  access to Veda learning has been exclusively male for many centuries and the  social system is patrilocal. In this chapter on the life of householders, however,  women are center stage and their oral histories are particularly noteworthy,  providing a counter-narrative to claims of patriarchal supremacy. In Chapter  6 on the ritual life, wives are further recognized in co-sacrificial roles. Some  brief details about the lives of fifteen patni were featured in the overviews of  families in Chapter 3. In the order of that village-by-village survey, wives of ahi tagni included Sundari, Surya, and Subbalaksmi in Sriramapuram, Anasuya  in Nedunuru, Satyavati and Kamesvari in Vyaghresvaram, and Anasuya

in Kakinada. Discussed also were the wives of other Veda pandits, some of  them potential ahitagni:  Laksmi, Savitri, and Kamala in Sriramapuram,  Narasamamba in Iragavaram, Sita Rama Laksmi in Simhacalam and Maruti  and Sita Nagalaksmi in Annavaram. Finally, Laksmikanta, widow of the  Konasima-born srauta champion Renducintala Yajulu, graciously contributed  her reflections on a half-century of agni-hotra. 

As sources of information about women “living in Veda” they varied  considerably, as did the circumstances of interviews. Some were present on  numerous occasions, often in the company of their husbands for long, mul tifaceted conversations about Veda, srauta, and life as patni in general. Only  one was not permitted by her husband to be consulted; some were in poor  health or in seclusion at the time of visits. A few contributed strongly only  after they became widows and enjoyed the uninhibited opportunity to speak  about their lives. Among the most informative of all were the youthful and  energetic Maruti, wife of Kapilavayi Rama Sastri in Annavaram, and their  married daughter Sita Nagalaksmi when she was still living at home; a reflec 

tive Anasuya in Nedunuru, particularly after she became the widow of Lanka  Venkatarama Sastri; Satyavati, wife of Bulusu Kamesvara in Vyaghresvaram;  Subbalaksmi in Sriramapuram after she was Bulusu Cayanulu’s widow; and  Laksmikanta, the strong-willed, assertive widow of the senior Renducintala in  Vijayawada. 

Narasamamba Laksmi, a skilled folklore field worker teaching high school  in Rajahmundry, with the additional cachet of stemming from a Vaidika  Brahman family, was freely able to enter the interiors of the more tradi tional houses where male outsiders were not welcome. She provided valu able recorded interviews with Anasuya, wife of Lanka, their daughter-in-law  Savitri, wife of Baballa’s son Bullebbayi, Subbalaksmi, second wife of Bulusu  Cayanulu (whose first wife, Rama Suryakanta, died at age twenty-four, c. 1945),  and others. It should be noted that familiar use of first names of patni, quite  untraditional, is apologetically adopted here to aid the reader in following the  narratives of scores of individuals. As mentioned before, all wives of soma sac rificers are known as Somi-devamma, an honorific that replaces given names  (and is contracted to “Sodemma” in colloquial Telugu). This title is the equiva lent of Soma-yaji or Yajulu that may be affixed to the name of the yajamana after first offering soma. Wives of an-ahitagni (non- ahitagni) pandits usually  have the traditional -amma, “Mother,” suffixes: Kamala, for example, is known  as Kamalamma. Since girls are named for goddesses at birth, and unlike boys  lose their family names when married, there is a certain amount of name  duplication. In the following remarks Anasuya, wife and later the widow of 

Becoming a Householder 159 

Lanka, is quoted, not her daughter Anasuya, wife of Mitranarayana, who was  not interviewed. 

Women speak their minds on many topics from the drudgery of kitchen  duties to joyous recollection of ritual roles. Conversations tend to focus, how ever, on several themes: the utmost importance given to madi, ritual purity,  the numerous tasks assigned in ritual life, failure of the new generations to  maintain traditional standards of their elders, the bearing and raising of chil dren, the loss of an older husband and trauma of widowhood, and the fragil ity of health in old age. A constant topic is first in this list, the significance  of remaining pure in self, kitchen, food, ritual rooms, and the household in  general, particularly when serving as hostess for visiting Veda pandits. To  be pure is to be auspicious; conversely, impurity carries the onus of being  inauspicious. 

Sundari and Baballa, occupying for many years the house on the corner of  Sriramapuram’s single lane and Mukkamalla road, served as gatekeepers for  the agrahara. No one could pass without notice. They became hosts for agra hara events large and small. Since a visiting ahitagni must rely on food cooked  only by a Veda patni this meant considerable labor for Sundari and then later  her sole daughter-in-law Savitri. Added to that burden was the loss of a child  only twenty days after her birth and care-giving for needy son Bullebbayi. Her  neighbor across the lane, Surya, wife of another ahitagni and also a frequent  hostess, bore fourteen children, of whom ten survived. What the historical  novelist Russell Banks captured in nineteenth-century America as “the dark  fatigue of women and the death of infants”1 must certainly be acknowledged  as a fact of twentieth-century life as well. The recounting of life-experience by  patni themselves, however, varies from matter-of-fact or upbeat acceptance to  the rare lamentation over the dark side. 

It was Laksmikanta, performer of agni-hotra for half a century alongside  her husband, Renducintala Yajulu, who expressed with animation the hard ship as well as the joys of the patni: “It is not easy to play the role of cook as  wife of a srauta ritualist. Guests come without prior notice and the wife should  be ready at all times to change into madi (Telugu ritual purity, Sanskrit sauca)  and prepare food. Chores in the kitchen are untold suffering for the wife of a  performer of srauta.” In the same conversation she also gave voice to a com monly held opinion regarding the softness and ill-preparedness of the next  generation: “My daughters-in-law are modern and have no faith in ritual life.  My sons help them in domestic chores and that is not right for men!” 

Satyavati, then in declining years, was amazed in recollection that she  managed to accomplish adhana and continuing agni-hotra alongside hus band Kamesvara: “I had a baby on the hip, a baby on my lap, a baby in the 

160 vedic voices 

stomach (Telugu kolupu), all these babies! But people in the village said ‘Don’t  be scared! If you perform agrayana once a year you’ll be fine as agni-hotrin.” By  the time of agni-stoma there were eight of an eventual ten children underfoot  and Satyavati was quite reluctant to advance into soma rites: “Children require  so much attention, my elderly mother-in-law needed care, and the thought  of cooking and serving so many people for five ritual days plus an additional  one was overwhelming.” Kamesvara prevailed, however, both of them offered  soma, added soma-sacrificer to their respective names, and decades later  Satyavati was proud to be Somi-devamma. 

For a patni, maintenance of an agni-hotra room and a puja area in the  kitchen in constant states of ritual purity is not the sole concern. As the moon  has its monthly phases she has monthly (masika) cycles2 but unlike the moon  her body may pose a threat. As noted in Chapter 2 the culture at large main 

tains deep-seated apprehensions about menstruation. The impurity (Telugu  maila, Sanskrit asauca) of a woman in her period, like death pollution, is par ticularly damaging in ritual situations. ApSS measures an-alambhuka, her  period, as three days. As the moon is invisible for three days per month, so is  a woman in her prime “invisible.”3 “Untouchable” is a heavily loaded, now a  constitutionally proscribed and outmoded appellation in the caste hierarchy,  but the Sanskrit term for a woman in menses means exactly that: she is nei ther to be touched nor to touch any person or item connected with food. She  turns her drinking cup upside down as a signal and withdraws into privacy. In  addition to the diksa that covers the impurity of death and menstrual blood for  a soma ritual there is another measure that can protect daily agni-hotra. The  belt of munja grass that encircled the patni for initial moon rites may take her  place near the offering fire for those three days while her husband performs  alone.4 

It has been an indological custom to treat the yajamana as sole sacrificer.  Here, however, as in previous publications,5 the patni is termed co-sacrificer. It  must be acknowledged that patriarchal subjugation prevails, as in most aspects  of life in the subcontinent. Vedic texts subordinate the patni, her mantras and  kriya are far fewer and she receives instructions in both domestic and extended  rituals from the yajamana, adhvaryu, and other males. Marriage is sometimes  described as her upanayana, the husband being her guru. At the same time it  should be recognized first that every Veda pandit stresses the essential role of  the patni. Baballa expressed it in January 1988: “Without a wife neither domes tic ritual nor great sacrifices can be performed. One obtains the authority of  a ritual life, karma-adhikara, only if she is present.” Lanka was quick to point  to ApDhS for that authority, noting that no distinction can be made between  husband and wife since rituals are performed jointly.6 Examples of the wife’s 

Becoming a Householder 161 

participation are legion. To take but one example, after offering the omentum  of an animal (today always a goat) the wife must accompany the yajamana and  priests to the kitchenette outside the arena for the necessary self-cleansing  because she too has sacrificed (ApSS 7.21.6). 

A second substantiation for applying the term co-sacrificer is  self-referential: patni have referred to themselves as agni-hotrin and have cited  other women as performers of extended sacrifices, as for example, Anasuya  addressing Duvvuri Sastry, “When your grandmother performed paundar 

ika . . .” A third reason concerns Agni: if an ahitagni needs to be away from  home for a fortnight or a month he may perform, respectively, paksa homa or  masa homa, fortnight or monthly offerings, and let the wife cover agni-hotra.  If she too must leave the home the fires become laukika, no longer sacred.  In other words, Agni cannot remain in a house without one or both. There  should be no hesitation in perceiving a joint role in the household either on  the grhya or srauta level of sacrifice. “I know,” said Laksmikanta proudly, “that  rituals cannot be done without me.” Maruti expressed it more bluntly: “One  who has no wife is useless, practically a corpse.” And more than one pandit  confessed that after his initial hesitation it was his wife who was impetus for  advancing to extended sacrifices beyond agni-stoma. 

Some wives of ahitagni and potential ahitagni take enormous pleasure in  recollecting the details of sacrifices or planning to undertake them. Maruti is  a fine role model for three daughters. She is as tough as she is alert, totally in  control, adroitly inserting her knowledge and experience into discussions of  srauta, carefully explaining the difference between yajna and yaga, correcting  mistakes in the observations of males in the room. Having grown up with her  ahitagni grandfather performing agni-hotra and isti on a regular basis she was  thoroughly acquainted with extended ritual life before marriage, then gained  far more as she married into a srauta family and traveled with the Kapilavayis  from sacrifice to sacrifice. “My husband routinely being a rtvij, I am now expe riencing the same srauta life I knew as a girl. A rtvij may bring his family if  he wishes, a matter of choice, and we stay in the same yajna-sala (temporary  sacrifice hall of bamboo and fronds) as other patni, sleep, eat, spend our time  there.” Kapilavayi Yajnesvara trained his two sons well in both text and ritual  and they are now reciting in famous temples, one in Simhacalam, the other,  Maruti’s husband, in Annavaram. But he and his wife also educated their  three daughters, in particular the firstborn of the five children, one who now  lives with her husband in Tenali and has knowledge of the Sama Veda as well  as the Taittiriya Samhita 

Satyavati, already mother of eight, including a baby of three months, when  she underwent the diksa consecration for agni-stoma, happily recalled all details 

162 vedic voices 

in a conversation many decades later. But a tinge of sadness entered her voice  as she commented: “My husband and I were so tied up with ritual actions we  had no opportunity to observe the great number of people feasting. We only  heard from others about the beauty of the whole scene. Feeding everyone in  the area at noon and again at 7:00 pm is so important. All who come should  eat, without exception. It is prasada, grace. Feasting at a yajna is special, full  of merit for it is anna-feeding, rice-feeding! Vyaghresvaram was famous for  that, but those days are gone.” And here Kamesvara added a bit of folklore  heard in other agrahara as well: “One day more people came than expected.  There weren’t supplies enough. Hired Brahman cooks (vanta-brahman) were  extremely busy. One merchant in town gave a full bag of tavudu (the outer  cover of a rice grain after the husk is removed, usually given to livestock) and  the cooks spiced up a special dish! It disappeared quickly and people remem bered our yajna for this special food!” 

### 2 Marriage 

A marriage (vivaha) is a splendid spectacle, everyone liberated from routines,  moving about with the electricity of a holiday outing, brilliant costumes, some  outrageous colors, an aroma of spices loading the air as Cooking Brahmans  labor to prepare vast quantities of food. And yet a marriage also means solemn  rituals with long midnight hours of mantras, fire offerings, seemingly end 

less recitations of pedigrees. “Marriage is performed out of paramartha, the  highest truth, and it must be continued always with sraddha, faith. Achieving  brahma-loka, the heaven of Brahma, is the whole import of marriage. In a mar riage ceremony happiness is not only for the bride, groom, and relatives. It is  a matter of joy for the entire community.” This earnest declaration by Duvvuri  Yajulu was seconded by others of both genders. Marriage enables the girl to  develop into the coveted role of a su-mangali, an auspicious married woman,  one who has, in T. N. Madan’s apt phrase, “a beneficent influence on the lives  of other people.”7 

Always popular in any gathering is a discussion of marriage, afford ing opportunities to explain two important features that only those in Veda  require. First, in order to guarantee the purity of a continuing Vaidika lineage  the choice of a bride for a Veda pandit must be rajasvala-purva, a pre-pubescent  girl who is the daughter of a woman who was married before puberty. This is  double insurance that no non-Vaidika, or worse, non-Brahman male might  have crept in from the shadows. Second, unlike most Brahmans, Vaidikas  insist on a full five-day ceremony, no skimping of ritual details or requisite 

Becoming a Householder 163 

mantras. If sleepiness overcomes many, including bride and groom, no mat ter, the correct mantras have been sounded. Highlighted are liaisons with  other Veda lineages guaranteed to be reputable, some of them declaring mul tigenerational allegiance to particular families and villages. And in common  with virtually the entire population of India past and present there is enthusi asm for sharing the precise monetary cost of a wedding, dowry being for many  the heavy burden of unloading a daughter and consequently going into debt,  

thus providing a credible explanation for insufficient funds today. It should be noted, however, that animated pleasure structures most conver sations on marriage, an emotion valorizing positive qualities of relationships  that in many cases, given the youthful ages of brides and grooms, have lasted  seven or more decades. Lanka and Anasuya were married for seventy-seven  years, Baballa and Sundari for seventy-one years, Duvvuri Yajulu and Surya  for sixty-seven years, and Kamesvara and Satyavati for sixty-six years. Pandits  and patni alike have great delight in detailing their own marriages and those  of children and grandchildren. The tradition of a man having a “co-wife” (sec ond wife), sometimes discreetly acknowledged in the wider culture and openly  known among Vedic Brahman Namputiri (Nambudiri) in Kerala (M. Parpola  2000: 209-12) is not mentioned. 

The guru in charge of a student’s learning has a say in marriage arrange ments only if he is a senior male within the family, matrimonial decisions  being the province of parents and grandparents. So important is Veda pandit  lineage preservation that marital prospects are often lined up before the birth  of a child. In the case of unions not so pre-arranged, rigorous investigations  into family backgrounds precede betrothal. Birth horoscopes are consulted  and there must be assurance not only of ancestry but also of correct and timely  performance of all samskara, life-cycle rituals, prior to marriage. Both purity  and character development are said to be cumulative concomitants of the  sequence of rites of passage that begin with conception and continue from  birth to the age of sixteen. There is hesitation about going too far afield to  secure a bride or groom. Background checks prove more difficult at a distance,  local villages being safer. 

In addition to Vedic branch (sakha), parentage, age, ritual refinement,  education, and compatible horoscope, two other qualifications concern gotra,  clan, and pravara, ancestral lineage. The term gotra has descended from  Indo-Iranian *gautra, cattle place or pen, indicating a close relationship  between cattle-herding communities and their herds. In India centuries later,  Vedic meanings held social and religious import—tribe, family, clan.8 One  must marry inside the subcaste, Vaidika Brahman, and one should marry  inside the sakha, Taittiriya, but conversely the choice must be outside both 

164 vedic voices 

gotra and pravara. Every clan claims descent from a patronymic ancestor and  each Veda pandit provides the name of his gotra as identification, for example,  Duvvuri Yajulu, Atri (Atreya) and Bulusu Kamesvara, Gautama, to name two  of the seven or eight ancient Vedic seers. Samavedam’s gotra was Harita and  Baballa’s was Srivatsa, two other ancestral lines of import but not among the  famous rsi. With regard to this exogamy, “marriage outside,” a bride should  not be united with a groom with the same pravara, the litany of ancient rsi con 

sidered to be ancestors. Both gotra and pravara (the latter a rapid declaration  of three names) are recited twice daily in sandhya-vandana, along with one’s  sakha (Taittiriya) and Sutra (Apastamba), and at stated moments in sacrifices.  Paternal ancestry is always kept firmly in mind, as is the constant connection  with those worthies of ancient days who first intuited the Veda. As Apastamba  states in his chapters on pravara (ApSS 24.5.1–10.18) the gods recognize a per 

son when he names his rsi ancestors. 

Ideally, the groom should follow the approved sequence of upanayana,  brahmacarya and Veda study, successful examination, and then marriage.  Apastamba prescribed no precise age, but as the period of adhyaya is approxi mately twelve years beginning at age seven or eight, the average age of the  groom should be about nineteen, the age of Kapilavayi Venkatesvara, for exam ple. But many boys achieve certification at a younger age. Laksminarayana and  Gullapalli Sita Ram Sastri were both married at age sixteen. Some boys who  married prior to certification, however, included Lanka at ten and Duvvuri  Yajulu at “thirteen or fourteen” he recalled. Recent attendance in modern  English-curriculum schools has lengthened education in a direction parallel to  Veda study and the age of Veda completion has been extended but not neces sarily the age of marriage. For example, Duvvuri Surya Prakasa was seventeen  when married in 1971 to Kanaka Durga, six years younger, and their four sons,  all with longer English curricular (not language) public schooling never expe rienced by their father or grandfather, were married at ages fourteen, sixteen,  seventeen, and eighteen, respectively in birth order. What did increase in that  generational shift was the age of consummation and cohabitation of bride and  groom, that is to say, the departure of the bride from her parents’ home to  residence with the groom. 

The age of the pre-pubescent bride has remained relatively fixed, usually  within a range of three to eight years younger than the groom. When Lanka  was ten his bride was seven. When Kapilavayi Venkatesvara was nineteen,  Sita Rama Laksmi was eleven. And when Laksminarayana and Gullapalli  Sita Ram Sastri were both sixteen-year-old grooms, their brides, Kamesvari  and Narasamamba, respectively, were ten and thirteen. Balya-vivaha,  child-marriage, proscribed by the 1955 Marriage Act, is proudly affirmed by 

Becoming a Householder 165 

Veda pandits. As one announced: “This is our tradition and we do it openly,”  the safeguarding of a lineage being the primary consideration. Consummation, the sexual act that completes a marriage, awaits the  arrival of “blossoming” and puberty rituals for the child bride who contin ues to grow up in the home of her parents. After first menses, seclusion in  a darkened room or screened off corner is concluded with a ceremonial bath  three days later. The rajasvala girl receives a coconut as symbol of fecundity  and a sari as adoptive grown-up attire. Puberty rites, not covered in the Sutras,  have no mantras or kriya and are transmitted in women’s oral traditions.9 She continues her schooling but otherwise remains in the house, expecting  eventual release to her husband for the merit-filled and auspicious act (punya and subha-karya), proper terms for consummation of the marriage. In ApGS  3.8.7-11 the culmination (and definition) of vivaha is “leading” the bride to the  home of the groom. Three nights of chastity sleeping on the ground with  a clothed staff between them (a third “person” on guard instead of a sword  between the medieval knight and his chaste damsel) are followed by first sex ual intercourse, a highly ritualized event late in the fourth night after many  hours of delayed gratification. But Apastamba’s schedule was no longer pos sible when pre-pubescence became the overriding desideratum for a bride’s  qualifications. Thus a gap of years occurs, sometimes many years, between the  marriage ritual and “the auspicious act,” requiring an expiation, prayascitta, to  be pronounced during the nuptials. Elder Anasuya, for example, married at  seven, was fourteen when she left the home of her parents to live with Lanka  and a generation later their daughter Anasuya was fifteen when she joined  Mitranarayana in Korumilli. 

In the most recent two generations a groom might require time to become  “established,” financially secure, which may mean employment in another  town until his bride joins him. For example, Duvvuri Sita Ram Sastry mar ried (Gullapalli) Syamala in 1991 when he was sixteen and she was ten.  In February 2000 during a visit to her home in Iragavaram where he had  arranged research meetings for this book with his maternal grandfather and  five uncles (one being his father-in-law), he was twenty-five and she was nine teen. Highly embarrassed and furtive, they found a moment to speak to each  other for the first time. Previously he had had only distant glimpses of her  during brief visits to Iragavaram. When he finally completed his computer  degree program in Hyderabad she could join him there a dozen years after  their marriage and today they have a son and a daughter, all of them living in  Hartford, Connecticut. Although he is laukika and not “vedam-lo,” at least the  marriage rules of the Veda pandits have been upheld and this will no doubt be  of significance in marriage arrangements for their children. His life goal is no166 vedic voices 

less than to earn enough in the United States to re-establish Sriramapuram as  a true Vedic agrahara. 

A prominent feature of South India is cross-cousin marriage such as the  one just mentioned. In menarika (Telugu) a boy marries his mother’s brother’s  daughter; a girl marries her father’s sister’s son. Long-term genetic effects of  consanguinity is a subject that elicits no interest, this being a tradition with  deep roots in some cultures of Dravidian languages but one proscribed by  Manu (11.172–73) and some other legal authorities outside the South. A strik 

ing case of serial menarika is the pattern of Duvvuri–Gullapalli marriages unit ing families across the Godavari River over several generations. Among the  children of Gullapalli Butchiram Avadhani and his wife Subbalaksmi were  a daughter, Surya, who married Duvvuri Yajulu, and a son, Sita Ram Sastri,  who married Narasamamba. Both of these couples were featured in Chapter  3. The first pair had five sons and five daughters and the second pair had five  sons and two daughters. These new generation sister and brother families  with seventeen children between them afforded opportunities to continue  Duvvuri–Gullapalli marital connections. Turning to the following generation  (Gullapalli) Surya and Duvvuri Yajulu’s third son, Surya Prakasa Avadhani had  four sons, grandsons of Duvvuri Yajulu, growing up in Rajahmundry. Each  was married to one of the granddaughters of Gullapalli Sita Ram Sastri, these  brides being the respective daughters of the first four sons of Gullapalli Sastri.  Bride and groom share the same grandfather, FaFa in the bride’s case, MoFa  for the groom. Since a male child is often named after his grandfather, in  more than a vague sense in Telugu culture reincarnating the old in the young,  it is as if a girl has been given to her grandfather. In the example given above,  Duvvuri Yajulu’s grandson Duvvuri Sita Ram Sastry (the computer program mer now living in Hartford, Connecticut) is named for his mother’s father (his  grandfather), Gullapalli Sita Ram Sastri. In 1991, as just mentioned, he was  married to his mother’s brother’s daughter, Syamala, also the grand-child of  Gullapalli Sita Ram Sastri. (See Table 5.1 for a chart of marriages between East  Godovari Duvvuris and West Godavari Gullapallis.) 

Marriages with tight-knit pools of eligible grooms and brides often mean  that people are related in multiple and complex ways. Interconnections of the  several Veda pandit families surveyed here are legion: one of Duvvuri Yajulu’s  sons was married to one of Lanka’s granddaughters and his second daughter  married a Bhamidipati relative of Baballa. Even without cross-cousin mar 

riage, proximity often produces liaisons, as for example, guru and student.  Lanka’s guru was an uncle of Anasuya so they grew up together as children in  the same household before they were married at ages ten and seven, respec tively, this union being non-menarika. Maruti, granddaughter of an ahitagni,

remembers that the two Kapilavayi brothers, Venkatesvara Sastri and Rama  Sastri, came to stay in the house for half the year to study with her grand father. “They spent so much time with my grandfather they felt obliged to  take a granddaughter, so I was acquired by the Kapilavayi family as a special  request.” She was married to the younger brother. 

It was noted in Chapter 2 that Bulusu Cayanulu gave a daughter to  Renducintala’s son in direct exchange for teaching that son in his house over  a period of years. But Cayanulu had three other daughters and in order to pay  dowry for one he had to sell land, including part of the acreage he received in  the Sriramapuram grant. Lanka paid Rs. 400 dowry to Mitranarayana for him to  marry the younger Anasuya, no land, cash only, and it was a considerable debt for  him. Costs on the other side for the hosting family of the bride are also extensive  as relatives might stay in the agrahara or village as long as two weeks. 

Many of the pandits in this survey have been involved in marriage cer emonies either within their own community or for local folk of the higher  castes. Bulusu Cayanulu routinely officiated, as does Duvvuri Surya Prakasa  Avadhani in the present. Baballa’s grandson Prasad does muhurta timings by  consulting birth horoscopes to determine the most auspicious months, days,  and hours, a service regularly performed by Baballa and Lanka in decades

past. Samavedam picked up honoraria by reciting blessings at marriages,  “never less than Rs. 500” being his reward. 

The program for the five nights of a Veda pandit marriage, although longer,  shares most standard procedures of ceremonies performed throughout India  today. ApGS 1.2.12–3.9.11 provides details for Taittiriyins. After some prelimi nary remarks betrothal and marriage are the Sutra’s first topics, with mantras  from RV and AV marriage hymns cited in a separate text, the Mantrapatha.  Early on, Apastamba observes that it is women who must be consulted for  local customs, an admission that it is the oral tradition of the distaff side  that keeps track of certain important details laced into the proceedings. He  displays knowledge of the ways of men when he recommends a girl who is  eye-catching to the groom but not one who has an attractive younger sister. 

The groom is welcomed by the bride’s parents into their house with  madhu-parka, a dish of honey in curds traditionally offered to a guest. The bride  and groom look intently at one another. In some ceremonies he pours water  over her as she stands under a sturdy wooden bullock yoke with a piece of gold  near the hole. When she has dressed he wraps a darbha-grass cord around her  waist and leads her west of the fire to sit down for offerings and mantras. By  her right hand he leads her north away from the fire for seven steps, they walk  around the fire keeping it on the right, and then together make offerings into  Agni during a steady stream of mantras from both sets of family priests, his  and hers. Then in another key moment the groom directs the bride to place  her right foot on a working grindstone north of the fire with the admonition  that she should be as firm and steady as rock (he will remember doing exactly  this himself during his upanayana). She clasps cupped hands together and  waits for him to sprinkle ghee onto roasted grains that are dramatically poured  from his upraised hands into hers at waist level. 

Repeated circumambulations of the fire and her foot placed on the stone  alternate with offerings, all with continuing mantras. Highlights on agricul tural symbols—the yoke, grindstone, ghee, and grains—are backdrop to sono rous mantras emphasizing the promise of fertility from this new union. These  are deep-seated traditions and the symbolism of the hole in the yoke, to take  one example, has a long chronicle from Rg Veda 8.80.7 to the marriage hymn  of Atharva Veda 14.1.41 down to Apastamba and commentaries a thousand  years later. And everywhere in the marriage hymns, of singular import to past,  present, and future soma-sacrificers, are celebrations not only of Agni but also  of the god Soma as lord of procreation and long-lived lineages. 

When nuptials are completed the bride remains in her parents’ home  while the groom returns to his village and his guru. She will live through years  of schooling until menarche when the couple’s departure from her parental 

Becoming a Householder 169 

home is as dramatic as the escape of newlyweds from a Western wedding.  This “leading away” of the bride, the vivaha, is augmented by the carrying  of live coals from her parents’ fire in a pot slung from cords, embers that  will transfer Agni for the pair in their new residence. Once established on  dry kindling, offerings into that fire take priority. At night the groom points  north for the bride to identify first the north pole star, Dhruva, its fixed posi 

tion in the night sky being a model of unwavering attachment, and then the  star Arundhati, Alcor, a dim but traceable star among the seven rsi that make  the constellation saptarsi (known in the West as Ursa major, the great bear, or  the plow, or the big dipper). Arundhati is the wife celebrated for fidelity to the  great rsi Vasistha. The new bride husks rice, he cooks it with ghee in a pot,  and together they make this cooked rice offering in the ritual simply called  sthali-pakana (described in Chapter 2), first to Agni, then to his alloform, Agni  Svista-krt. For many couples this becomes daily observance morning and eve ning prior to eating breakfast and supper, sometimes with the first offering  going to Surya. 

To those who have witnessed Hindu weddings in India, North America, or  Europe many of these procedures are quite familiar. Most have been in place  in Grhya Sutras for well over two millennia and some mantras accompany ing specific acts derive from Rg and Atharva Veda hymns composed another  millennium earlier. For example, kanya-dana is the gift of a girl from father  to groom. Apastamba alludes to this moment without making it the high lighted ritual act it later became. Although he states that she will not return  to her natal home (like most dana, ritual gifts, it is permanent) she will in  fact visit from time to time, particularly during periods of childbearing. Other  Sanskrit terms in use throughout India include the joining of right hands,  pani-grahana, taking seven steps, sapta-padi, circumambulating the fire clock wise, Agni pradaksina, placing the bride’s right foot on a stone, asma-rohana,  pouring puffed rice from groom to bride to fire, laja-homa. Even the “driv ing,” udvaha, from the bride’s home and village toward the groom’s residence  has remained true to ancient practice although the get-away vehicle today is  a brand-new rented car rather than a chariot (ratha) drawn by two beasts of  burden, and today all five nights are captured on tape by professional videog raphers. The tying of the mangala-sutra, an auspicious thread on the bride’s  neck, so important today, and the addition of toe rings to the bride, are both  addenda well after the Sutra period.10 

In the matter of remarriage, a strict double standard prevails. It is accept able for the widower but unthinkable for a widow to remarry and ApDhS  2.6.13, a discussion of inheritance and paternity, rules widow remarriage sin ful. Bulusu Cayanulu married again only eight months after the death of his 

170 vedic voices 

typhoid-stricken young wife. Fourteen-year-old pre-pubescent Subbalaksmi,  purchased in Gangalakurru, became his ritual partner for Renducintala’s paun darika. Of the eight different forms of marriage listed in Asvalayana Grhya  Sutra 1.6.1-8, ApDhS 2.5.11-12 mentions six, the one known as daiva marriage  pertaining to a girl who becomes daksina, ritual payment by the sacrificer to a  priest who is serving in his ritual. In Cayanulu’s case, however, the payment  was oblique since the yajamana, Renducintala, was not the father of the girl. 

### 3 Children and Their Life-cycle Rites 

In the center of the main room of the spacious and immaculate new house  a three-month-old baby is constantly rocked side-to-side in a wooden cradle  by his grandmother, Maruti, then swung vigorously head-to-toe in a green  hammock suspended from the ceiling. He sends out no cry for Dramamine.  Maruti has just performed a minor rite, something like an extra samskara,  life-cycle rite. The baby started making fists with his hands, as if squeezing  imaginary balls, so relatives came to be fed with fist-sized lumps (Telugu  mudda) of cooked rice. Here, as in every household, babies steal center stage  from older children running about. In Chapter 6 the diksa consecration is  detailed, a srauta ritual in which both sacrificer and wife are reborn, stammer ing and making fists like babies. 

“In the old days there was no ban on having children. In fact, the goal of  marriage is to obtain children.” Having said this, the correct ritual life always  uppermost in his mind, Lanka was quick to point out the three-debt obligation,  the rna mentioned in Chapter 2, as he effortlessly recited Taittiriya Samhita  6.3.10.5: “At birth a Brahman is born with three debts, studentship to the rsi,  sacrifice to the gods, and children to the ancestors.” Here Lanka recalled our  previous discussions of avadana, cuttings, portions of the dismembered goat  in pasu-bandha, animal sacrifice. Paying off these debts, he said, is accom plished in the fashion of offering pieces of the goat one at a time: learning and  reciting Veda as a student, performing sacrifices, and having a son to perpetu 

ate the lineage are the three debt payments.11 Lanka, like the other pandits, was  solicitous of the dora who has three daughters, no sons, and no continuing  lineage in his name. 

Lanka and Anasuya had eight children. Duvvuri Yajulu and Surya raised  ten children and so did Kamesvara and Satyavati. Such large families are strik ing in contemporary America and Europe but not so unusual in earlier times.  Lyman Beecher, the renowned nineteenth-century American evangelist, had  twelve children, one of whom was the equally eminent Henry Ward Beecher,  father of ten children. The Abolitionist, John Brown, hanged in 1859, had 

Becoming a Householder 171 

twenty children, seven from his first wife, thirteen from his second. Until  family planning was introduced and encouraged in mid-twentieth-century  India, a sizable number of offspring, especially sons, was the norm. Lanka  and Anasuya, with seven sons in a row, were considered in their day a peerless  model. The showcasing of sons is evident in Duvvuri Yajulu’s family photo.  (Figure 3.4 shows Duvvuri Yajulu and family on his sixtieth birthday, 1975.  Seated center right, Surya on Yajulu’s left; sons one to five extend prominently  from his right hand; five daughters are mixed with sons' wives in the fading  background.) 

Details about marriage rituals, laws, celebrations, dowry and other costs,  and sons were readily forthcoming from all Veda pandits but information  about daughters and grandchildren had to be gleaned from women, not  always immediately approachable until after several visits. In Baballa’s family a  daughter who lived only twenty days was mentioned only by a younger female  member of the family, not by Baballa himself. Lanka, when asked about chil 

dren, would always report on the seven sons. A daughter, the firstborn and, as  it turned out, his sole line of continuity in Veda, was an afterthought. A review  of the Veda pandit families outlined in Chapter 3 shows a range from one to  ten in the number of children actually brought up in the household: Duvvuri  Yajulu and Surya, ten; Kamesvara and Satyavati, ten; Lanka and Anasuya,  eight; Laksminarayana and Kamesvari, eight; Mitranarayana and Anasuya,  seven; Sita Ram Sastri and Narasamamba, seven; Samavedam and Kamala,  six; Bulusu Cayanulu and Subbalaksmi, five (with Cayanulu and his first wife  Rama Suryakanta one, for a total of six); Baballa and Sundari, one. Of these  nine senior pandits, identified here as the “old” generation as opposed to their  sons and colleagues in the “middle” generation, and their grandsons in the  “young” generation, the average number of children is seven. The number of  children who died in infancy, an understandably sensitive and largely undis closed topic, again reminiscent of nineteenth- and early twentieth-century  Europe and America, was rarely disclosed (one in one family, four in another). 

With the “middle” and “young” generations there is a sharp decrease in the  number of children, sons and grandsons with their spouses adhering closer in  each generation to the national slogan “We are two, we have two,” in an India  where half the population is under twenty-five years of age. With the exception  of Baballa, no pandit of the senior generation had fewer than six children. In  the “middle” generation few families are that large, and in the “young” gen 

eration, those now still in their childbearing years, it appears that once a son  or two is born, family planning locks in. Conception is celebrated as an enor mously significant milestone for newlyweds. Maruti moved to Annavaram at  age sixteen to begin a new household with Kapilavayi Rama Sastri. “For seven 

172 vedic voices 

years I did not conceive. I tasted yajna-payasam (rice pudding made on the  sacrificial ground, believed to promote conception) from different sacrifices.  I was present at many yajna as I accompanied my husband and father-in-law  from sacrifice to sacrifice.” There was proof in the pudding: Maruti delivered  three girls and then finally, the obligatory boy to close her childbearing years  with four. Duvvuri Phani declared in 1998 after becoming father of two chil 

dren, both sons, that the second was the “final” child. Family planning, essen tially vasectomies, tube-tying, and contraceptives, denigrated by Lanka and  blamed for what he weighed as softness and a lack of stamina in the younger  generation, has been welcomed in a new age. In the case of Baballa’s grandson  Prasad and wife Laksmi, three daughters were followed by Laksmi’s inability  to bear more children. Sonless, with three girls requiring dowry, surrounded  by women who bore mostly or all sons, Laksmi’s vast, luminous eyes rapidly  dimmed with deep sorrow. 

Much has been said about the upanayana and Vedic study of boys from the  age of seven or eight. In Veda pandit lineages, girls, although ineligible for  the initiatory ritual and adhyaya, are not neglected when it comes to a Vedic  future. Married as early as seven or eight, the same age as boys hearing their  first mantra from a guru, girls hear the mantras for five nights in the vivaha ritual. If their families have a tradition of srauta practice, they will have grown  up observing sandhya-vandana, twice daily milk offerings, new- and full-moon  rites, harvest rituals, and many other ceremonies, and become entirely famil 

iar with the rules of madi. As a boy progresses through his portions of Veda,  largely unknown to his bride in another village or agrahara, her parents will be  conscious year by year of her suitability as patni, possibly in a sacrificial career. 

Turning now to the samskara, rites of passage, some have already been  noted, including the upanayana thread investiture for a boy that marks entrance  into the first life stage (asrama), that of the celibate student; the sama-vartana that signals completion of initial Veda instruction; and the vivaha marriage  ceremony that observes passage into the second life stage, the householder.  Also noted was the rite of impregnation (garbha-dhana), placement of an  embryo in the womb of the bride, originally on the fourth night of marriage  but today occurring after the bride attains puberty and leaves the home of  her parents to live with her husband of several years. As the upanayana is the  most significant life-cycle transition for a young boy, so is puberty the crucial  life change for a girl since it indicates readiness for marriage and entrance  into womanhood. And yet the event of menarche is not a samskara and goes  without remark in the male-oriented Sutras. The concern for proper paternity  of offspring has pushed back the timing of marriage to a safe distance prior to  puberty and allowed the bride’s biological change to take place in the parental 

Becoming a Householder 173 

home with due family, but not priestly, recognition. Nothing, however, has  altered the central emphasis on procreative powers of females as the key to  continuing existence. The principal image of the bride is a fertile field where  seed will be sown and a living child emerges in verification of fecundity. 

The total number of life-cycle rites is not fixed and there is no tradition  of performance required of everyone. Most families, however, adhere to the  same pattern and follow Apastamba’s Grhya Sutra coverage of what are some times taken to be a set of sixteen, a number perhaps derived from the ancient  soma tradition. Like several other Grhya Sutra authors, Apastamba begins with  betrothal, marriage, and a desired conception of a new being. As noted, fire  from the bride’s parents’ home (venue for the five-day marriage) is taken to  establish the new domestic hearth, and that fire will be the cynosure of all sub sequent rites of passage. Just as rice, coconuts, and other agricultural products  are central to marriage rituals, so too will they recur in many samskara, ripen ing being a key metaphor for the steady progress of an individual life-body. 

In the sixth chapter of Apastamba two prenatal rituals are addressed, the  pumsavana with its desire that the embryo be a male child, performed usually  in the third month when pregnancy becomes visible, and simantonnayana,  the upward parting of the wife’s hair by the husband, usually in the fourth  month of the first pregnancy only, a graphic expression for safe delivery from  the womb. Although the general belief is that the mother’s contribution to an  embryo is uterine blood and the “soft” internal parts, while the father’s con 

tribution is semen and the “hard” parts, with the stronger one determining  gender, the astonishing fact that a ritual such as pumsavana can alter gender a  dozen weeks into embryonic development testifies to the power of mantra and  performance. If the result is a male child, confirmation is readily announced.  If no one mentions pumsavana again, a female child was born. 

Both prenatal rites employ special items, the one for a male child a green  shoot from a banyan tree bearing two figs resembling testicles. The mother-to be lies on her back near the fire while her husband presses into her right  nostril a small bit of the ground shoot from that tree famous for its aggressive  spread. Mantras express hope for an easy delivery. For simantonnayana she sits  by the fire while her husband stands behind and combs her hair three times,  first with a porcupine quill with three white spots, then three blades of darbha grass, finally with a twig from a different fig tree, the udumbara. New barley  sprouts are fixed to her hair and she touches a calf. 

The delivery itself becomes a ritual, jata-karman, birth-rite, performed if  possible even before the umbilical cord is cut. The “production of wisdom”  is the initial act when the father uses a gold spoon or ring dipped in honey,  curds, and ghee to touch the infant’s mouth while whispering into the right 

174 vedic voices 

ear the name of Vak, sacred speech. Mantras about ayus, long life, are followed  by the endowment of a secret name, known only to the parents, and the infant  is given to the mother’s right breast. The next ten days are the period of con finement of mother and child in the birth room, a place of impurity where a  special prophylactic fire or lamp, sutika-agni, is burning. Emergence of mother  and child on the tenth day is auspicious and calls for nama-karana, the rite  of name giving, when the secret name is augmented by a public name for  lifelong use until honorific titles are earned in replacement, Yajulu, Cayanulu,  Somidevamma, Somayaji, for example. 

The number ten is significant. For ten lunar cycles (nine solar months) the  embryo developed in the womb, undergoing personal construction through  samskara from garbha-dhana to jata-karman. At the other end of this existence,  this rebirth, there will be a similar period of ten days after death and crema 

tion for ritual construction by means of mantras, rice, sesame, and water of  a temporary cover for the naked, vulnerable spirit (preta or jiva). Those ten  days after cremation will simultaneously eliminate the pollution of death and  create, body part by body part, a transitional shelter that allows the enduring  spirit to become a pitr, ancestor, and receive a new body to continue in another  birth. Thus mother and newborn child are freed from the impurity of birth  pollution in the confinement room, as the baby exited the mother after gesta 

tion, as the spirit emerged before and will emerge again from its previous and  future temporary bodies, all on a scale of ten.12 

The next important ritual after name-giving is the first feeding of the  infant with solid food, most significantly, rice, in the anna-prasana. The baby’s  lips were touched at birth with honey and two products of the cow, curds and  ghee. Now, after about six months of mother’s milk, it is sacred homegrown  rice (anna, the same word meaning “food”) that is featured in another ritual,  cooked rice being mixed with the trio of honey, curds, and ghee. Apastamba  makes no mention of nis-kramana, literally stepping out, the first occasion for  the baby to go out of doors in the arms of a parent to see the sun and moon,  usually in the fourth month. It is, however, observed by some pandit families  as it is in the wider Hindu culture. 

Apastamba finds a place in the child’s third year for the caula ritual, also  known as cuda-karana, the first tonsure. This mirrors something of the simon tannayana for the mother-to-be in the use of a porcupine quill, darbha grass,  and fig-tree twigs to comb the hair of a male child before it is shaved away,  leaving only the cuda, tufts at the back of the head as daily reminder of ances tors when they are named during sandhya-vandana. The placement of a wire  ring, right ear first for boys, left ear first for girls, is the earlobe piercing,  karna-vedha. Apastamba and Hiranyakesin tuck this rite in at the end of the 

Becoming a Householder 175 

upanayana when the boy ornaments his body in the ritual attempt to make  him presentable for marriage. Here Hiranyakesin, who invokes the two Vedic  meters known as Viraj and Svaraj, supplies mantras and details including an  encomium on the formative powers of gold. Current Veda pandit families per 

form this on babies of three or four months. Later in life the ahitagni acquire  heavy gold earrings to mark the completion of soma sacrifices, their earlobes  strikingly drawn down to reveal large rectangular gaps. 

At the age of sixteen the first shaving of facial hair on a boy is accompa nied by another shaving of the head, this time including the tufts at the back  left growing during cuda-karana some thirteen years before. It is remarked  by Apastamba as go-dana, the gift of a cow, ostensibly to the guru. It is also  known as kesanta, reserved for later beard growth well after completion of  the majority of samskara. In addition to the sama-vartana “return” from  Veda studies and consummation of the marriage this rite marks the pas sage from childhood to adulthood, the monstrous Scylla and Charybdis of  childhood diseases and child-snatching demons having been successfully  navigated. Again, the number sixteen, as in the ideal number of samskara recalls the importance of the soma tradition in this gradual perfecting of a  given life-body. It is apparent that most life-cycle rites are concerned with  the vulnerable period from conception to that more secure teen age since  the only one remaining is the final rite of passage, antyesti, cremation after  death, the “last sacrifice” being that of a used body. In the tradition of the  endless sacrifice, that final samskara is also the first one for a new body, resi dence of a new embryo. 

Hiranyakesin, Baudhayana, and other Grhya Sutras supply additional  details and the patni are always forthcoming with regard to local customs,  but it is Apastamba who covers almost the full spectrum of traditional rites of  passage. Birthdays, not considered samskara, are also celebrated. Karttikeya,  great-grandson of Duvvuri Yajulu, was feted in 2005 in the home of his grand 

father, Surya Prakasa Avadhani, by his father, Sita Ram Sastry, and mother,  Syamala, in a gathering of some forty Veda pandits and family members  including Gullapalli relatives from Iragavaram. Blessings were recited in  ghana, and a birthday cake with pink frosting honored his first birthday. 

In sum, samskara, each requiring the domestic fire, sprinklings of water, a  declaration of intent (samkalpa), and an auspicious constellation (naksatra) for  proper timing, are believed to construct gradually a true and worthy person,  one refined, perfected, and purified by the full sequence of rituals. Duvvuri  Yajulu noted that “it is not possible to expect an integrated character from  those who neglect proper performance of samskara” and he lamented the  modern reduction of rites of passage in both number and duration.13176 vedic voices 

### 4 Livelihood 

Long walks on rain-drenched roads from Nedunuru to Vyaghresvaram allow  the traveler to see the ways the local folk make their living. Coffee-colored  mud trying with every step to suck chappals from feet, bursts of showers send ing rivulets into shoulder ponds, jade leaves of tapioca gleaming in sporadic  sunlight, scenes heightened every few hundred meters by vistas of a score of  women bent over rice transplants, their brilliant red, yellow, and blue saris  shouting over the passionate green of the fields. Well ahead is the harvest sea son when lines of men will move at a steady trot, balancing loads of this paddy  on their heads, aiming for a far corner of the field where bullock carts wait for  the next load. Never a tractor in any of these expanses. This tropical hike in  part follows the same track as Lanka half a century ago trudging to and from  his Veda lesson of the day. The village of Mukkamalla bustles. A woman at the  well filling her brass lota douses all her neighbors within a hundred meters  with salty invectives. A boy of perhaps nine years swings a massive hammer  onto the glowing ruby iron on his father’s anvil. He will do this every day for  another fifty years, performing his duty, in the parlance of the Gita, even as  another nine-year-old acts according to his dharma by reciting back the fourth  kanda of the Taittiriya Samhita. 

A great yellow Tata truck fills the Sriramapuram lane beside an immense  mound of coconuts from surrounding orchards, reminding an observer that  the learning of Veda and performing of offerings are not the only activities  here in the agrahara. Sweating brown men in skimpy loincloths punch the  heavy nuts onto sharp spears standing upright in the ground as others collect  milk and meat or strip husks to load the truck for sale in Hyderabad. Coir will  soon be turned into doormats for American, European, and other markets.  As mentioned before, a tongue-in-cheek Telugu proverb ranks a coconut tree  as more reliable than a son. The coconut haul, like the great stacks of paddy  in burlap bags at the time of the two rice harvests, affirms the agrahara as a  productive segment of one of India’s choicest agricultural zones. 

Economic aspects of Vedic life are not favorite topics of discussion for pan dits although many will point to financial insecurity when attempting to explain  the disappearance of agni-hotrin and extended sacrifices from Konasima. Most  give credit to the TTD parayana scheme and affirm the honoraria, pension  plans, and other subsidies that enable pandits to teach their sons and others,  maintaining the Taittiriya texts despite a declining ritual tradition. The transi tion to a cash economy in the late twentieth century was overwhelming to a  number of families. Samavedam, as noted in Chapter 3, was a good illustra tion of the dilemma, attempting to teach sons and grandsons while feeding 

Becoming a Householder 177 

and clothing an extended family, trying to reconcile two demands, adhyapana at home and paid recitations away from the agrahara. 

The founding of two Brahman agrahara, Sriramapuram in 1955 by the  Dokka family and Kamesvari in 1960 by Nedunuri Srirama Murti, occurred  with the generous notion of providing subsistence to qualified pandits, many  of them entirely devoted to Veda and srauta. The dana for each pandit selected,  eventually fourteen in Sriramapuram and five in Kamesvari, included a half  or full acre of agricultural land with a respectable yield, a house site, and Rs.  1,000 for construction of a new house. The disposition of land, a valuable  possession in an agricultural region, had different histories over the genera tions as each family grew, divided, traded, sold, and experimented with crops.  All the pandits either rented out their acreage for others to work for a por 

tion of the yield or became “gentlemen farmers” who supervised kuli labor ers from the abundant supply of low-caste families in the area. According to  varnasrama-dharma, the laws of class and stage of life, a Brahman may not  directly cultivate the land. 

Some pandits have been more intensely engaged in agriculture than oth ers. Lanka and Baballa were both true hands-on farmers who monitored every  crop through its seasonal changes. Lanka inherited six and a half acres from his  father and could see all of it from his study, expecting the fine yield of twenty  bags of paddy per acre each harvest as well as robust production from coconut  palms. As a boy he watched his father manage the local S.C. (Scheduled Caste)  labor crews from dawn to dusk regulating irrigation ditches, then plowing  and harrowing with bullocks tugging carved wooden plows, then seeding and  transplanting by teams of women, then harvesting, winnowing, and bagging  with additional migrant labor. When he took charge he imitated Baballa by  turning crop fields into office space where he could teach students, consult  with colleagues, counsel folk who came unannounced to the local sage for  advice, watch over the laborers and negotiate prices with merchants. The  half-acre of land that came with the original donation he turned over to a ten 

ant farmer who paid with either paddy or cash. Intercropping of cocoa plants,  tapioca, or gherkin cucumbers between coconut palms was one experimental  technique, as were additional crops such as green grams, mangoes, sugar cane, and tobacco. Fear of drought, so prevalent inland in Telangana, is sel dom in mind for those in water-rich Konasima. In fact, local Veda pandits  are sometimes recruited to cure drought-stricken areas. A visit to Tirupati on  November 17, 1980, revealed among the sixteen pandits praising the gods in a  Varuna-puja several pandits included in this study. 

Veda pandits in general have strong attachment to and concern for the  land and its produce. Duvvuri Yajulu spoke of ksema, the peace, security, and 

178 vedic voices 

welfare of the land (desa), and Lanka had intense respect for the traditions  of landholding, refusing to turn to the new hybrid seeds that were claiming  responsibility for India’s green revolution. “That seed is not native but for eign,” he objected. He used bovine manure only and cited Dharma Sastras  that confirmed his view that synthetic pesticides and chemical fertilizers  damage the soil and produce unhealthy food. A buffalo or cow gave milk for  

agni-hotra and the family, any excess not to be sold but to be given to others. If one follows agricultural reports on production in Konasima, Lanka’s  organic farming principles may have cost him considerable rupees. Despite  his farm income and the minor earnings in honoraria for rtvij service and  examiner’s fees he stated with equanimity that he had been in debt his entire  life. Not long after his death Anasuya complained about the oppressive dabbu (money) culture of modern India and the distasteful necessity of soliciting  rupees for sacrifices. That, she explained, is the reason we did not perform  them ourselves after agni-stoma. 

After years of working his land Baballa sold it when he was crowded out  by squatters. Samavedam, perhaps the shrewdest Veda pandit when it came  to finances, also sold his plot in order to buy a smaller one with a better yield  from a tenant farmer. He reported that he had to pay Rs. 43,000 for the mar 

riages of his first and second daughters and had to scour much of the east  coast picking up honoraria for recitations, a practice his sons continue today.  Bulusu Cayanulu first sold his inherited lands and then the agrahara donation  to pay the marriage expenses of a daughter, after that struggling to remain  within the budget of a TTD salary and occasional sabha honoraria. Duvvuri  Yajulu was the last of the Sriramapuram Veda pandits to keep his original  acre. His third son, Surya Prakasa Avadhani, has been fortunate in living in  a splendid agrahara-like compound in the town of Rajahmundry, rent-free  as long as he teaches Veda. He and other middle-aged pandits such as the  two Kapilavayi brothers and the five Gullapalli brothers, each of these seven  living in a substantial modern house, have ever known the penury of their  elders. The Kapilavayi brothers entered TTD salaried employment early in  their careers and can look forward to pensions when they retire from temple  service. Fulfillment of ahitagni and patni aspirations appears to be imminent  for Rama Sastri and Maruti. 

The agrayana harvest sacrifice, to be considered more carefully in Chapter  6, is the most important obligatory ritual for ahitagni beyond agni-hotra and  lunar isti. Until recent years it was also an annual domestic ritual for many  Brahmans with only a single fire. So significant is agrayana that many strug 

gling with the incapacities of old age make special efforts to complete it every  year either on new- or full-moon days of Asviyuja or Karttika in the autumn, 

Becoming a Householder 179 

or Phalguna in the spring, rekindling lapsed fires just for this. Baballa and  Sundari, for example, continued until he was eighty-seven, in a special sala constructed in front of the house. Blind Duvvuri Yajulu, the effervescent  granddaughters of Baballa-- Rekha, Madhuri, and Kalyani-- giggling furiously  around him, declared that 80 percent of the benefits go to the community and  insisted on performance of agrayana to the end. No one may eat the new rice  until it is offered in a rite that takes two or three hours, and of course no one  may eat rice at any time without being in a state of ritual purity. The connec 

tions between the land, the people, and food are always palpable. As noted in the second section of Chapter 2 the entry into pandits’ lives  and fortunes of the Tirupati-Tirumalai Devasthanam (TTD) and the Andhra  Pradesh Charitable and Hindu Religious Institutions and Endowments  Acts made all the difference for the recent generations. The officers of the  temple famous for its wealth channeled funds for decades into promoting  “Vedic culture” through salaries, pensions, and honoraria to Veda pandits  for special or daily recitations (parayana) or, more recently, for their publica tions and other accomplishments. As noted earlier, opinions of the overall  impact of these programs has been mixed. Some see a waning Vedic tradi tion saved by temple and government largesse, and point to historic sup port for Veda pandits mentioned in sthala-purana and inscriptions such as  the Simhacalam temple appropriation from its treasury for Veda adhyaya dated 1383.14 Many Andhra pandits signed on to the recitation schedule.  Samavedam, for example, the most eager participant, started at age thirty  and remained until he died. Duvvuri Yajulu, Cayanulu, and Mitranarayana  received the higher ahitagni salaries and served until incapacities became  restrictive and they accepted pensions. For them it was a worthwhile pro gram. And without doubt the TTD also succeeded at inserting Vedic tradi tion into popular culture. Cassette recorded recitations are heard on local  bathing ghats and every important temple in Andhra dramatizes one to four  different Vedas being recited live. 

On the other hand, the TTD is blamed by some for interfering with tradi tions regarded as reclusive, virtually secretive, away from public scrutiny and  institutional control. Baballa and Lanka were among those who rejected offers  to become, as they saw it, “employees” of the TTD who descend into “selling”  the Veda in exchange for a steady income. They also worried about invita tions to young pandits from Hindu temples in New York, Chicago, Pittsburgh,  Atlanta, Houston, and other American cities. “Only in the isolation of an agra hara,” elders said, “away from worldly distractions, can an ahitagni survive.  Our young men will go there and not return and that will mean the destruc tion of srauta as well as the teaching of Veda here.”

### 5 Old Age, Retirement, and Thoughts on  Renunciation 

In his green-canopied house under beckoning palms in Nedunuru Lanka  was asked how he was feeling. “Jirna!” he replied, summoning the Telugu  and Sanskrit word for digestion. Never a complainer, he was not indicating  stomach or bowel problems but a larger, insoluble one. “I am being digested  by Time” was his message. When he used the familiar metaphor of food for  the untreatable process of aging he might have been reflecting the Taittiriya  Upanisad refrain he learned about the age of ten: aham annam, aham annam,  “I am food, I am food!”15 As noted in Chapter 3, Lanka announced that he  would die at age seventy-two because that was his father’s age at death in 1947.  Also, a mrtyu-cakra, death chart, prepared for him by an astrologer, indicated  severe negative effects from the planet Rahu. But what seemed like Rahu’s  fatal illness was countermanded by Atharva Veda mantras that he knew by  heart. Medicine prescribed for his diabetic condition might have had some thing to do with a return to health. Two years later he and Anasuya discontin 

ued agni-hotra, a cessation permitted by Apastamba after thirty years of daily  performance. In 1988 a kinder death chart predicted that he would live to  be eighty and indeed he celebrated sahasra-candana darsana, his sight of a  thousand full moons. At eighty-three he enjoyed taking on a new student and  commented: “Death is inevitable but the will to live is strong.” The satisfac 

tion of living on was replaced by suffering at eighty-six, however, with paraly sis, inability to walk or feed himself, slurred speech, and dimming eyesight.  “There is no more necessity for existence. There are some remaining days,  that’s all we have,” and he died at age eighty-seven in June 1999, fifteen years  beyond the first astrological predictive reading. 

Anasuya, married to Lanka for seventy-seven years and with eight surviv ing children, died on the last day of 2005. Her age of ninety was unmatched  by anyone in her lineage. A woman of advanced age owns increased prestige  in the agrahara or village and Anasuya fit the description by Duvvury (n. 9) of  the fully auspicious married female, the “ultimate goal of every woman.” 

Duvvuri Yajulu and Baballa, next-door neighbors in Sriramapuram, also  became nonagenarians like Anasuya. They were ninety-four on the Indian  calendar by which they reckoned. As indicated in the capsule biographies  of Chapter 3 the Konasima pandits and wives have an enviable longevity  record. Laksminarayana, the youngest ahitagni to die, did not quite reach  his eightieth birthday. Kamesvara and Mitranarayana, both in their eighties,  ceased agni-hotra but continued to teach, Smarta manuals for the former,  Taittiriya Samhita for ten- to twelve-year-old students for Mitranarayana, who 

Becoming a Householder 181 

followed the tradition of his father before him, teaching Veda fifty years or  more after agni-stoma. In sum, the average age at death for ahitagni in this  survey of the close-knit complex of Vyaghresvaram village and the agrahara of  Sriramapuram and Nedunuru was eighty-six and a half years.16 

“Retirement” is therefore a qualified term for Veda pandits who may leave  TTD parayana service but continue to teach Veda and other subjects as long as  they have voice and stamina. Becoming a wilderness wanderer in vana-prastha,  the third asrama between householder and world renouncer, is sometimes the  traditional recommendation when a man finds gray in his hair and his sons  have sons.17 But such withdrawal from agrahara or village is seldom a choice  for pandits who live on and die in their homes, not the forest. And retirement  now has an entirely new face since the advent of TTD, state, and central gov ernment honoraria and pension funds for Veda pandits, with special consider 

ations for ahitagni. The Veda pandit family suddenly became like the families  of those employed by the State Bank of India or the Indian Railways, free from  financial distress or dependence on largesse from children and grandchildren,  with a check arriving on schedule monthly. The security derived from a reli 

able pension is inestimable. 

The Vedic ritual life, on the other hand, is subject to retirement and may  be abbreviated or curtailed when senescence begins to limit mobility. ApSS  3.14.12 suggests thirty years as a possible minimum for the performance of  agni-hotra, an honest recognition of what is generally called “body weakness,”  afflictions magnified by age. Joints are distressed from constant rising, sitting  cross-legged, rising again, not to mention smoke-filled eyes and, worst of all,  failing memories of mantras and kriya. Remaining “madi-tied” to rules of purity  and pollution when reciting or offering also may exact a toll, the necessity of  bathing, for example, particularly in the chill of December and January waters,  loading fevers and colds on the aged. Extended sacrifices are fatiguing and older  pandits accept fewer guest-priest roles when offered. In a forty-day paundarika,  for example, there is no beverage or cooked food, nothing until late-afternoon  phala-hara snacks of fruits, nuts, and cold leftovers. During a sacrifice a rtvij is  permitted a rice-and-curds meal cooked on either the garha-patya or daksinagni fires but often this is declined in the busy-ness of the event and the general  desire to prevail in traditional pandit opika, endurance. Read machismo here. 

When it came time to diminish their daily routine, blind Duvvuri Yajulu,  with an increasingly frail wife Surya, explained that agni-hotra can be performed  in two ways, one with kriya, the other with mantra, and it was the former, the  actions, they were compelled to abandon. “We now perform with mantra recita 

tions, allowed for those in old age with physical handicaps.” Parayana in the  small agrahara temple only a few steps from his house was done for two decades 

182 vedic voices 

until he retired at age seventy in 1985. Samavedam was only thirty when he  signed on for TTD recitation in 1963 and served for the rest of his days, Cayanulu  participated until pensioned in 1993, and Mitranarayana, who enrolled at age  forty-nine in 1979, remained active until he was almost eighty. The ahitagni 

recited in local temples with a higher salary than other Vedic Brahmans. In a marriage ceremony the boy (never the girl) is ritually presented with  a mendicant’s staff and offered a choice: Kasi-yatra, running away to Varanasi  to become a renouncer, or proceeding to tie the knot with his parent-chosen  bride. Invariably, the life of samnyasa being as remote to a twelve-year-old as  the dark side of the moon, he goes on with the ceremony at hand as the lesser  evil. The ideal of the renouncer’s mode and its power, however, remains vivid  in the Vedic community of elders. Ascetics, in the eyes of Veda pandits, are  supernumeraries, perhaps because Apastamba, particularly in the Dharma  Sutra, pays close attention to them.18 In the general population an ambiva lent evaluation of sadhus and other ascetics prevails.19 On one hand they are  suspect, thought to be fakers, not fakirs, sluggards who have copped out of  real-world effort. On the other hand, they are marvel workers worthy of atten tion. Balayogi of Mummidivaram, east of Nedunuru on the Gautami branch  of the Godavari, was an ascetic who was believed to eat only one day a year, on  Siva-ratri, the all-night worship of Siva. After he died in 1985 his foster brother,  “Little” Balayogi, acquired similar fame. Even a decade after his death in 1992  crowds were so immense that special buses, police patrols, and water supplies  still came to Mummidivaram in the heart of Veda pandit land. These pandits claim to be unimpressed by the Balayogi pair and similar  pop yogis but they all have their own ascetic narratives to tell. Floating in a  high echelon above all other Brahmans, the Veda pandits seem suddenly to  size themselves down in the company of renouncers who have exchanged  worldly life for a lifetime of wandering village to village, sleeping wherever  possible, eating whatever food is offered, serving as illustrations of a life-stage  beyond householder. A few may have bizarre outfits, such as one who came  for alms from the dora wearing around his neck a bright yellow plastic Donald  Duck. But vairagya, disgust with worldly desires, is treated with utmost seri ousness as a vow, in the words of the Kapilavayi brothers, “requiring courage,  extremely difficult to uphold.” Baballa pointed with pride to his mula-purusa,  root ancestor, Bhamidipati Brahmibuta Acarya, who became a samnyasin after  producing sons to initiate five generations of soma sacrificers. Sathya Sai Baba, who died at eighty-four in April 2011, served up a good  case for a renouncing figure of widespread appeal. A Sudra, a lowly rank to the  high-born Vaidikas and presumably one not to be touched, he was nevertheless  widely accepted as “guru” for his charitable works and his famed “presence.” 

Becoming a Householder 183 

Beyond that, he was a target of devotion as a deity become human. His seventi eth birthday celebration on November 23, 1995, was much the topic of conver sation in Konasima that autumn and Duvvuri Sarvesvara, Bulusu Cayanulu,  Samavedam, and others provided effusive descriptions of their invited week in  Puttaparti in southern Andhra, not forgetting emoluments for lending Veda to  the party. “I had not seen him before,” said a beaming Cayanulu. “For seven  days I  recited Veda in his presence. That was wonderful! I  was given new  clothes, Rs. 5,000, Rs. 1,000 for travel, and my wife (Subbalaksmi) received  a new sari, gold bangles, a pressure cooker. Until I  went to see him I  was  feeling weakness but I recited with great ease. My daughters pointed out that  all this was due to his blessings, because I had darsan of him.” Lanka’s son,  Annapurna Sastri, knowing that Sathya Sai Baba had dramatically cured him self in 1963 of a disease described by devotees as either tubercular meningitis  or stroke, went to his free hospital for heart bypass surgery. At his death the  

Sathya Sai Baba Trust was reported to be worth at least $8.9 billion. Mitranarayana also talks about Puttaparti but without obsequious tones.  “Sathya Sai Baba offered me Rs. 40,000 to sponsor a yajna. I asked about the  animal sacrifice that is dictated by Veda and Baba accepted on the grounds of  those Vedic sanctions. But I thought what if we are in the midst of the sacri fice and he dismisses us with full fee. We would be committing the sin of an  incomplete sacrifice. How many other yajna would I have to perform as com pensation?” Mitranarayana did not trust the famous saint to keep his word and  therefore excused himself. 

Equally unimpressed was Lanka, who had absolutely nothing to report  about the sudden visit of the entourage of the senior Acarya of the Kamakoti  Pitha, Jayendra Sarasvati Swami, to his tiny, remote house beyond Nedunuru.  It was a manifestation that struck Duvvuri Yajulu with wonder, as if the swami  were the Maharaja or a new incarnation of Siva. Lanka did, however, wonder  if he should offer food to this Jagadguru Sankaracarya who, contra Balayogi,  probably ate on most days of the year. 

In the final analysis, Konasima pandits appear to follow Manu in under standing moksa as “a synonym of renunciation,”20 virtually the Niebuhrian  relevance of an impossible ideal with no immediate reward. Renunciation and  liberation are there as supposition for the next time around, a future rebirth.  As for ista-purta, which Kane tidily defines as “the cumulative spiritual result  of merit due to . . . performance of sacrificial and charitable acts,”21 Duvvuri  Yajulu summed it up: “Merely for doing sacrifices, janma-rahita, absence of  rebirths, will not occur. Performing a karma does not bring freedom from  rebirth. Those samnyasin who renounce everything . . . they alone are eligible  for janma-rahita.”

Another elder in Konasima found a metaphor to describe svarga loka, the  heaven promised to the performer of a rite such as the vaja-peya in which the  sacrificer climbs a ladder placed against the sacrificial post and proclaims on  behalf of his wife and himself together: “We have reached heaven, we have  become immortal.” What does this mean? “It is like a summer resort,” he  offered. “A tourist can have a good time as long as his purse is full but when  the money is gone he has to return home.” Brian Smith also noted this tem 

porary character of svarga loka: “The ritual journey to heaven taken by human  sacrificers . . . must be a round trip.”22 The contradictions of an exalted sta tus as lifelong sacrificers, yet householders short of renunciation render the  co-sacrificers model enigmas, those who, in Jan Heesterman’s words, “should  encompass the world and at the same time keep out of it.”23 

### 6 Death and Beyond 

The subject of death and dying has its own folklore in India, and here the Veda  pandits are not immune. To begin, the vocabulary of thanatos, like that of  eros, is circumvented to every extent possible. Terms for the burning ground  (smasana), cremation (antyesti), ancestor rituals (sraddha), and funeral priest  (apara-vetta) all require pronominal circumlocutions (“there,” “then,” “those,”  “that one,” respectively). The word for widow (vedhava) is unspeakable. Unlike  the easy discussion of Vedas and Sutras, pandits are uncomfortable talking  about current funerals with procedures found in texts separated from auspi cious rites of passage. When a certain temporal distancing has intervened, a  few terms regain normal use, such as words for annual and monthly obser 

vances for the deceased (abdika and masika, respectively). At times these  sensitivities create tensions. As noted earlier, Mitranarayana expressed sur prising displeasure with his own guru over refusal to administer last rites for  Mitranarayana’s ahitagni father. 

One folkloric theme has to do with time, sequential deaths in a particular  family, for example. Among the Bhamidipatis, Baballa died, then his son, then  his wife, all within eleven months. Shortly after Cayanulu’s death his son-in law became victim of a fatal scooter accident. Duvvuri Yajulu’s eldest daugh ter died only months after his wife and Surya Prakasa Avadhani noted that  Duvvuris not only had a pattern of the auspicious wife dying first but many  die in Dhanur-masa, the month of Dhanus or Sagittarius. There is widespread  belief that fates are determined and the arrival of Mrtyu, Death, is no hap penstance. Protective measures such as wearing selected gemstone rings for  either defense or supplication concern specific nava-graha, nine planets, Sani 

Becoming a Householder 185 

(Saturn), Kuja (Mars), and the lunar eclipse nodes Rahu and Ketu being those  most feared in one’s horoscope. 

Another folkloric aspect concerns space. When a house has been vis ited by Mrtyu it must be vacated for a time. Bulusu Cayanulu’s house was  boarded up for a year and his widow, Subbalaksmi, found it necessary to live  in Rajahmundry after his sudden demise in the house, apparently under an  inauspicious constellation. Lanka’s house, also closed, was opened only once  a month for masika rites at the place of his death. Laksmikanta and her fifth  son, Renducintala Yajulu Narayana, recall the death in Kasi (Varanasi) of hus band and father when authorities demanded that the special funeral known  as losta-cayana be done on the opposite bank of the Ganges, not the Kasi side,  quite contrary to his desire. Rites were permitted only when it became known  that he was a highly honored ahitagni who had performed more soma sacri fices than anyone in India. 

A widow in the agrahara is conspicuous by her absence. She is no longer  the auspicious married woman (su-mangali) but an inauspicious (a-mangali)  person who must wear white with head cover, no flowers, perfume, eye  make-up, or pasupu-kunkum, the auspicious turmeric and vermilion cos 

metic. She remains away from auspicious events. Her mangala-sutra marriage  necklace was broken on the day of her husband’s cremation. As T. S. Madan  phrased it, she “has lost her own blessedness as well as the power to bless.”24 In contemporary India her existence is not as bleak as in former times and the  practice of sati, self-immolation on her husband’s pyre, is considered ancient,  foreign, and barbaric in coastal Andhra. Today she may no longer be required  to sleep on the ground, regularly shave her head, or restrict herself to a single  meal a day, although some do choose the last as appropriate. The Tadithota fes 

tival that opened this chapter would not be a choice for her as she is an inaus picious sight to others and remains at home. Although she eats food with no  spices and regularly fasts she may still travel to visit children and grandchil dren and enjoy pilgrimages to local or far off sacred sites. As Subbalaksmi  noted in Chapter 3 she experienced a kind of rebirth in learning to read and  recite praises of deities and she was happy to return to her old neighbors in  Sriramapuram after a year’s absence.25 

A tradition apparently not practiced in full outside of Andhra is the spe cial funeral for an auspicious wife who dies “out of order,” that is, before her  older spouse. Never becoming a widow, she remains auspicious and her last  rites are positive ones. Known as musi-vayanam in Telugu, it is remarkable  for its female-directed procedures, including a brahma-muttaiduva, a special  Brahman priestess who ritually embodies the preta, the spirit of the deceased  released from the cremated body, reverses time until she is a bride again,186 vedic voices 

transforms her into the goddess Gauri and (in direct conflict with brahmanical  sraddha programs of absorption into either her husband’s lineage of ancestors  or her own maternal lineage) dispatches her to Gauri-loka, the heaven of the  great goddess spouse of Siva. 

This is a dramatic, sometimes boisterous ritual, essentially a possession (avesa)  of the Brahman priestess by the deceased who may act out objections to her pre mature demise. Two cases of musi-vayanam were mentioned in Chapter 3, Rama  Suryakanta, Bulusu Cayanulu’s first wife, who died of typhoid at the youthful age  of twenty-four after bearing a single child. Duvvuri Yajulu’s wife Surya, who died  after a full life and delivery of fourteen children, also received musi-vayanam in  1996. The husband does not participate although he sometimes watches from a  distance two crowds of all-women mourners, those from her natal side and those  from his side, converge. They present in winnowing fans separate offerings at  the feet of the deceased-as-priestess and then take away as prasada, grace, the  consecrated leavings of the goddess—bananas, turmeric, saffron, incense, little  mirrors, combs, and bangles—each woman receiving these in a winnow. Since  it is auspicious for the wife to die first, she having succeeded in protecting her  husband from the grim reaper, it is the sole providential funeral, and mourners,  all with flowers in their hair, may shed no tears or express any sorrow, only admi 

ration for one who escaped the dreadful fate of widowhood.26 That which lies beyond death for the householder Veda pandit and patni is  the subject of numerous agrahara or sabha discussions and is closely related  to the matter of renunciation reviewed earlier. Deliberations, to the ear of an  outsider, are firmly constricted by a universal belief in the unitary nature of  Veda, the inadmissibility of any change in worldview between the Samhitas  and the Upanisads, for example, thus ruling out acceptance of innovative  doctrines of karma and rebirth in the latter. Karma, samsara, and moksa are  simply read back into “the Veda” as a whole and no historic or linguistic shift  may be considered. Discussion of these subjects, however, certainly provokes  queries: Does a lifetime of agni-hotra or yajna lead to any afterlife rewards?  Baballa thought his performance of aruna-ketuka would allow him to enter  the world of Brahma, brahma-loka, and communicate with the absolute lord  without hindrance. Does drinking soma produce results beyond the here and  now? When funeral texts state that the deceased join their ancestors in heaven,  which heaven is this? Is it the same one reached by a ladder in the vaja-peya?  Many are the queries, but replies do not always form a consensus. The last  part of Chapter 6 reviews the final samskara, death rites, including special  funerals designed only for ahitagni and their patni.

## 6 Becoming Agni 

A long line of virtually naked men march the sand shore hauling a  half-sunken barge upstream, pulling sluggishly but relentlessly with an  over-the-shoulder rope fixed to the top of the mast. Within sight further  upriver are more day laborers, blue-black skin glistening in the heavy sun 

light. They are also skeletal in structure but immensely strong, struggling to  carry a water-soaked tamarind trunk slung on vine-ropes up the steep levee  toward a lumberyard. Washer folk stand thigh deep at the river’s edge end lessly slapping folds of cloth against flat stones. Altogether they provide rich  tone poems to the music of the wide Godavari in scenes that an observer today  notes would have been the same 3,000 years ago. 

This chapter collects portraits of contemporary Vedic ritual life that, aston ishingly, are also some 3,000 years in age. When stalks of a green creeper are  enthroned and worshipped as a king whose fate is to be pressed into soma juice  and drunk by a sacrificer who then claims immortality, there is resonance in  early Vedas of a thousand years before the Common Era. When sixteen priests  line up in crouching postures to snake-crawl their way through the ritual ground,  the hand of each on the shoulder in front, stealthy deer hunters stalking the very  sacrifice they are conducting, there is witness to a mystery predating any histori cal text, perhaps even the Rg Veda. The same open-air altar is being constructed  today as in ancient India; invitations go out to the same gods of earth, midspace,  and heaven to join in the drinking of soma and feasting on roasted animals; and  the same chorus of mantras floats on the air as in antiquity. 

In order to appreciate these grand rituals, however, there must first be a  review of the ritual life introduced in Chapter 2 and a more careful definition  of the single-fire household and then extension of Agni into a three-fire sys tem and potential soma and animal sacrificial dramas. This chapter considers  the crucial steps taken when Agni, lord of the household, becomes threefold,  fivefold, a receptor of soma, and eventually the medium of transcendence and  cosmic incorporation in the funeral ceremonies.

188 vedic voices 

Mentioned in Chapter 2 was an important distinction between  “pre-classical” and “classical” periods of Vedic texts and rituals. If one were  to employ an “archeology” of Vedic tradition it would be the Vedic Sanskrit  Brahmana texts and ritual Sutras that represent the “classical” rituals this  chapter is about to explore. In the case of coastal Andhra this means primar 

ily the Taittiriya Brahmana, its appended Aranyaka, and the Srauta Sutras of  Apastamba supplemented by Baudhayana. These texts were composed largely  in the period c. 800–500 bce, a middle portion of the first millennium bce. 

Probing beneath them one would locate the “pre-classical” level of the  Rg Veda, Atharva Veda, and other Samhitas such as the Taittiriya of the  Krishna Yajur Veda, compiled c.  1200–800 bce. This stratum represents  the Old Indo-Aryan speakers who entered India sometime after c.  1500  bce. Deeper still, stratigraphic analysis would reveal the level of an earlier  Proto-Indo-Aryan-speaking culture, one with a different dialect, a people who  may have called themselves Dasas. They were pastoral nomads who migrated  to India c.  2000–1500 bce and fused with indigenous agrarian folk speak ing a non-Indo-European language and inhabiting the broad area east of the  Caspian Sea to the Indus River, the region known to linguists and historians  as the Bactria Margiana Archeological Complex (BMAC). The Dasas may have  built the forts described in the Rg Veda. And there are suppositions that the  singular Veda of melodies, the Sama Veda, may have originated with these  people speaking a language outside the Indo-European family. 

This archaic level may have included the Vratyas, “known for their unorthodox  aggressive behavior and raiding habits” as Jan Heesterman noted in his studies  of the agonistic and cyclical dimensions of pre-classical Vedic ritual. While this  archaic culture left no texts that precede the Rg Veda, the much later classical rit 

uals, the maha-vrata, asva-medha, pravargya, and vaja-peya, for example, do carry  survivals from that remote era, including the influence of Harappan religion in  the last phases of the Indus Valley civilization c. 1200 bce, in a continuing period  of cultural fusion of non-Indo-European-speakers and Proto-Indo-Aryans. Of sig 

nal importance to emergent Vedic religion is the *sauma cult of what appears  to have been a mysterious plant, perhaps akin to ephedra, one that evolved into  haoma for Indo-Iranian speakers to the west and soma for Rg Vedins in the cen turies prior to the middle of the second millennium bce. Some of these survivals  from deep antiquity will be encountered in various segments of this chapter.1 

### 1 Agni, Private and Extended 

A blend of natural learning ability, recitation skills, and dedication to hard work  creates a successful Veda pandit out of a brahmacarin. In Chapter 2 the Vedic 

Becoming Agni 189 

student was seen to begin his lifelong bond with Agni by daily agni-karya that  he learned on the second day of his initiation ritual. He collects kindling for his  guru and looks after one or more fires, offering, for example, seventeen twigs  from a branch of a ravi or medi tree with a mantra for each, waiting to see that  each is entirely burned, doing an expiation if he has missed a day. Today his  guru is most probably his father or grandfather and he is therefore doing rou 

tine household chores. But the hearth he cares for is not the ordinary kitchen  one, although that may be an additional responsibility. Signs of the growing  mystical liaison between brahmacarin and fire, the transforming power of Agni,  occur in a moving passage in one of the two oldest Upanisads, Chandogya 4.6– 

15, dated perhaps to the seventh century bce. When his guru is briefly away a stu dent receives instruction in the highest knowledge from the fires he is tending.  Upon return the teacher discovers splendor, a glow of wisdom in his student,  and asks who it could be who has taught him during his absence. In reply the  guru hears: “These (fires) look like this now, but they were different.”2 And it is  the older Konasima pandits who confess to wondrous experiences during rev eries sponsored by their fires. Baballa, for one, related two different luminous  apparitions rising out of his fires, annunciations that he later understood to be  the births of his son and, many years later, his second grandson. The emotions  carried in such descriptions are quite unlike any others and reveal insights into  the Agni-yajamana bond. The student begins to discover fire, to borrow Gaston  

Bachelard’s phrase, as “one of the principles of universal explanation.”3 When his basic education is concluded and his wife of several years is at  last able to join him, a household fire for the couple may now be established  either in a separate hearth in his parents’ house or in a new residence. This  aupasana fire receives the sthali-pakana cooked food (rice) offering and is now  available for private domestic rituals such as homa offerings or life-cycle cer emonies. As described in Chapter 2 it cannot be used for soma or other srauta rites opened to the wider pandit community. It may be said that apprecia tion of the esoteric configurations of sacrifice arise later in life. Intimations  of signal meanings, however, may occur in pre-teen years during adhyaya, as  in the case of the Chandogya Upanisad student. Concentrating on retention  of verses in order to feed them back correctly, he may also absorb the basic  vocabulary of the soma sacrifice, for example, the minutiae of sacrificial ele ments, ritual tools, various deities, animals, priests, mystical constructions,  and symbolic links between them all. His father or grandfather guru may be  one who has done the ritual under study and “outside of class” favor him with  accounts of the performance. 

He may become intrigued by the mysteries of a particular sacrifice. The  asva-medha horse sacrifice, for example, fascinated Kapilavayi Rama Sastri as 

190 vedic voices 

a beginning brahmacarin learning TS 4.6.6–9, 4.7.15, and so on. Then after  several more years he discovered the magnificent equine-cosmic catalogue  that opens the Brhad-aranyaka Upanisad. It remains today his favorite ritual  although, not being of royal lineage, one he cannot perform. Nor could he  observe one or participate since it has been obsolete for centuries. It lingers  as imaginative drama, a ritual of two years’ duration with an appreciative day 

dreaming audience of one. 

Only a fraction of the certified Veda pandits and patnis of Konasima estab lish three fires, perform agni-hotra twice daily, and move on to their first soma sacrifice, the agni-stoma. A few may elect to perform agni-hotra on a single fire  after grhya adhana. Upadhyayula Nagendram, for example, in a multigenera tional family of ahitagni in Amalapuram, chose not to advance to agni-stoma. In this overview, however, all the featured ahitagni elected to perform adhana with multiple fires and proceed with yajna (agni-stoma). In some cases, Bulusu  Vyaghresvara and Bulusu Kamesvara, for example, fire-setting and first soma rituals were scheduled on two successive days and within the year 1955  Mitranarayana did both. Normally, however, the distance between adhana and  agni-stoma should be at least one year of agni-hotra. “The old tradition, doing  them separately, is better,” said Duvvuri Yajulu, and so he advised his relative  in Iragavaram, Pisapati, who did agni-stoma in 1991. 

### 2 The Adhana, Setting the Fires for Srauta  Agni-hotra 

A Vedic student’s guru, usually his father or grandfather, determines the tex tual selection and pace of learning Veda. Parents select marriage partners  when they are still children, sometimes even at birth. These two decisions,  instruction schedules and marriage, are not personal ones. A commitment to  set the fires for a career as agni-hotrin and co-sacrificing wife is different, and  is perhaps the single most important decision in the lives of a Veda pandit and  his spouse. It must be undertaken jointly and with deep consideration. This  giant step expands upon a lifelong intimacy with fire that began for the boy  with Agni maintenance as a brahmacarin. Now the liaison takes the form of  twice-daily milk offerings and a demand for shared caretaker roles of constant  fire tending with the proper implements.4 

Small wonder that few pandits and wives project the hope of performing  adhana, and still fewer actually go through with the ritual. One act of commit ment is a three-day performance of vaisa-deva as a transition from domestic to  srauta ritual life, a series of offerings to the All-gods to be described later under 

Becoming Agni 191 

the catur-masya (part 6 of this chapter). Often the adhana is put off time and  again until late middle age or beyond. Lanka, the foremost regional authority  on srauta, delayed until his late forties and was prodded along by his son-in law, Mitranarayana, who had set the fires at age twenty-two, two years earlier  than his own father. Lanka, not the son of an ahitagni like Mitranarayana, had  to sacrifice two animals in penance prior to adhana. Kapilavayi Rama Sastri  is waiting until a retirement pension from TTD service begins, economic  independence being a serviceable explanation for delay. Duvvuri Sarvesvara,  Yajulu’s eldest son, considered adhana late in life, his career being devoted  to the worship of Siva and recitations of Puranas. He finally announced in  2007 that he would establish hearths and proceed to agni-stoma, a change of  heart perhaps prompted by his younger brother, Surya Prakasa Avadhani, long  ready to open this ritual gate, but one who could not proceed until Sarvesvara’s  sibling blockade was cleared away. Looming heavily in local lore is the earlier  generation’s case of Kapilavayi Yajnesvara Agnihotra Sastri, never able to per 

form srauta rituals because his older brother, Pedda Rama Sastri, had not set  fires. Duvvuri Sarvesvara, however, never accomplished adhana. The adhana, also known as agny-adheya or adheya, is a relatively uncompli cated ritual in a special room of the sacrificer’s house. It requires a readiness  to recite scores of mantras on demand, two full days beginning on a new- or  full-moon day, usually in the spring, and four priests, adhvaryu, hotr, brahman,  and agnidhra, the last an acolyte of the brahman who is, as his name suggests,  closely connected to the ritual fires. In essence, adhana serves to “put in place”  a set of clay hearths (ayatana) that will remain as sacred center for the couple,  a cosmic, mystical space, until one of them dies. The room, not visible to out siders, is entered twice daily for offerings and other times for fireplace mainte nance. It should be large enough to seat four rtvij for isti. Three hearths are the  focus of ritual action with a storage area (vedi) nestled between them. Another  pair of hearths has outlying placement for this performance: the sabhya and  avasathya are seldom re-employed. (See Plan 2.2. Ground plan of five fires for  adhana.) Four are on the west-east line across the agni-hotra room with the  daksina fire slightly to the south. The temporary sabhya and avasathya fires  continue the eastward line outside the house. 

ApSS 5.1–25 provides the program followed in Konasima. Determination  of a proper asterism to govern the ritual must be done and this is a matter  of some controversy in the Sutras.5 The first day is devoted to bathing and  nail-trimming the couple, shaving and tonsuring the yajamana, and obtain 

ing sacrificial materials (sambhara). These include fire-sticks of various woods  and several kinds of earth for hearth foundations collected in pots and bas kets. Hearths are then shaped out of wet clay on the floor. The clay hearths

of coastal Andhra usually have a softly contoured low profile, unlike the high,  sharper edged configurations of western India. 

Just west of the garha-patya, a fire is either churned or brought directly  from the aupasana household fire; over it the adhvaryu cooks rice in water or  milk. Again, it is important to remember that rice is “food” and without the  help of Agni this life-sustaining substance is inedible. A  portion is offered  to this brahmaudanika fire and four plates are distributed so the priests may  eat. Ashes of this temporary fire are cleared away and each hearth receives  sprinkled water, then layers of sand, the collected soil (from a termite mound,  a rat burrow, a boar rutting, and pond clay), the collected twigs of five different  woods (asvattha, udumbara, parna, sami, and from any tree burned by light ning), and finally, as crowning layer, a piece of gold. The couple stays awake  all night. As the sun rises the adhvaryu and agnidhra, in the presence of a  horse,6 heat the two fire-igniting arani, ritually present them to the sacrificer,  then churn fire by pulling the rope back and forth, twirling the upright male  spindle (pramantha) held in place between the wood blocks. A spine-tingling  moment occurs, visualization of the first flame curling up from bone-dry  wood shavings on the female block. 

TB 1.2.1.15–16 is recited during this mystical production of Jatavedas, a  constant epithet of Agni who knows all the human generations. He emerges  from the semen (retas) in this womb (yoni) of the female block secure on the  ground. A  witness to this fire drilling, one deriving little inspiration from  striking a kitchen match, may be forgiven a grip of emotion, a sense of being  transported to the first such human generation of fire, documented some  400,000  years ago. A  series of mantras from the RV and saman from the  SV (themselves drawn from the RV) accompanies these steps. For example,  SV 1.79, based on RV 3.29, compares Jatavedas within the kindling blocks to  the human embryo in the womb. Phrases from the TA also declare homolo gies between the priests, ritual apparatus, and abstract powers such as speech,  mind, and breath. Every opportunity is taken to employ correspondences  (nidana, bandhu) proclaiming all the cosmic dimensions of Agni ritually  brought to this household as the foundation of an advanced sacred career. 

Now comes the all-important transfer of the newly kindled fire onto the  layered hearths, the adhvaryu taking a fire pan to the garha-patya first and then  to the ahavaniya, as the agnidhra priest next moves embers from the freshly  lighted garha-patya onto the daksinagni. The sacrificer recites auspicious  names of Agni and dispatches inauspicious, even destructive powers of the  god in the direction of an enemy, bhratrvya, or rival, sapatna. In subsequent  rituals this adversary, real or imagined, will be invoked frequently, often in  astonishing ways. If he (and the enemy seems always to be male) is merely a 

194 vedic voices 

phantom, these phrases are swiftly glossed over, but if one has a serious foe, a  rival complicating one’s ritual, political, or marital plans, that name is elevated  to the status of designated target. If that rival is suspected of using abhi-cara, black magic, special defensive measures must be taken in counter-sorcery,  often employing mantras from the Atharva Veda.7 

The adhvaryu then takes embers from the ahavaniya to light the remaining  hearths, sabhya and avasathya, until all five fires have been inaugurated. This  pentadic layout is a harbinger of the far more elaborate five-layered fire altar  of the agni-cayana ritual that may be undertaken by those who become soma 

sacrificers. In fact, the eastern direction out of the house presages extended  sacrifices in the future. The cosmos being fivefold as well as threefold, Agni is  thus omnipresent, here, now, in this home. 

The adhana celebrant next recites in praise of each of the five while the  adhvaryu bakes loaves on eight terra-cotta pans for Agni. In a ritual dice game  the yajamana wins, to no one’s surprise, with the best throw. More loaves are  baked by the adhvaryu and his crew, this time on eleven sherds dedicated first  to Agni and Visnu, then to Agni and Soma. This is the first invocation of Soma  in the new fire complex. Again these ritual acts are accompanied by elaborate  homologies between abstract agents and all the human and physical compo 

nents of sacrifice. Ritual payments are presented to all priests by the sacrificer.  The yajamana has already been called upon to recite mentally the morning and  evening formulas for agni-hotra, and now, on the following morning, with con siderable emotion, he and his wife perform the rite itself. The ritual of setting  the fires has been completed, agni-hotra has been inaugurated, and the penta 

dic array may be reduced to a normative triad, tretagni (treta-agni) three fires. Apastamba allows for the rekindling (punar-adheya or punar-adhana) of one  or more sacred fires in case of accidental extermination, a death in the family,  the loss of the arani fire-kindling woods after they have absorbed the fires, or  if both sacrificer and wife must be away and cannot take the fires with them. If  the lapse is extensive, one of three asterisms (Rohini, Punarvasu, or Anuradha)  must govern this re-establishment. ApSS 5.26–29 gives details, including a  placation of Agni by declining his name in various grammatical forms.8 

### 3 The Agni-hotra, Sunset and Sunrise  

Milk Offerings 

Because of multiple meanings, the term agni-hotra, literally “offering to Agni,”  often confuses those outside the sacrificial tradition, including educated  Hindus. It is a liquid food offering to Agni, fresh milk or ghee poured twice  daily from a havani ladle with a grooved “elephant’s tongue” spout into the 

Becoming Agni 195 

  

Figure 6.1. Ladles used to make offerings into Agni, Sriramapuram 1987.

ahavaniya fire. (This ladle appears on the right in Figure 6.1.) Agni-hotra is also  the triadic complex of all three fire-hearths, one or more with active embers or  cooling ashes. It may be, like other sacrificial terms, a personal name, as in the  son of Kapilavayi Rama Sastri and Maruti, Agnihotra Sarma. But it is above all  Agni himself, the god Agni-hotra who receives the libations. In that circular  sense for dedicated ahitagni it is God receiving God. 

Initially established with five hearths, the domestic srauta ritual com plex is reduced to three at the close of fire setting. A decision is made about  the degree of “permanence” to assign to each hearth. While some sutras  require fires in all three, ApSS 6.2.13 provides relief, considering the vigi lance, labor, and expense of keeping three sets of embers, by allowing for  the garha-patya alone to be safeguarded and tucked in for the dark night.  Therefore when the yajamana and patni are ready at sunrise, or later at  sunset, garha-patya embers dropped into the ahavaniya ignite dry straw  just long enough for the milk (already heated short of boiling point, then  cooled) to be offered onto the flames. Drops remaining in the ladle are  consumed by the couple as a share of what Agni has just received. These196 vedic voices 

drops are literally his ucchista, leavings endowed with his powers. In a simi lar fashion, when the southern fire (daksina-agni) is required, garha-patya embers are distributed there. 

In the evening agni-hotra mantras are addressed to Agni, then Prajapati,  lord of sacrifice, while at dawn they go to Surya, the rising sun, and again  to Prajapati. In both offerings preparatory gestures include the placement of  blades of darbha grass and tosses of water from the fingers of the right hand of  the sacrificer around the molded frames of the three hearths. In houses where  there is more than one nitya-agni-hotrin the rites can be simultaneous, as in  the case of the Dendukuri family in Vijayawada today where the hearth com 

plexes in the spacious but well-trafficked agni-hotra room are only three feet  apart. Baballa was one of six brothers, all of them nitya-agni-hotrin like their  father, and he remembers an extraordinary array of hearths and murmurs of  simultaneous mantras. 

Sutras discuss the cooperation of an adhvaryu in agni-hotra but for most  families the brief rite is private like the sandhya-vandana that accompanies  it and no rtvij is required. Eligible sons or former students on occasion,  however, might take the adhvaryu role in order to sit beside their fathers  or gurus. The cooperation of patnis is normative but also optional, not  requisite. Subbalaksmi, for example, went to the puja corner to perform  vaisva-deva, a token offering of milk or curds for “all gods,” both evening  and morning while Bulusu Cayanulu simultaneously did agni-hotra alone  inside the ritual room. 

On the other hand, Renducintala Yajulu and Laksmikanta were so closely  bound that late in life when he was crippled she held onto him, managed  the fire, and ladled milk from the terra-cotta pot into the fire while he did  the mantras. Early mornings are suitable for honoring the sun since Surya  namas-kara (now familiar to tens of thousands of Westerners taking yoga  classes) is a standard prayer greeting to the rising sun, as customary as the  sandhya-vandana. If an offering is being made in the agni-hotra room then  sunrise becomes an occasion for family worship, some inside the house,  some outside. 

Agni-hotra quickly becomes routine and may occur as many as 22,000  times in the thirty-year career of a faithful ahitagni and spouse. In Bringing the  Gods to Mind, Laurie Patton employs her title to concentrate on the applica tion of mantras in rituals. It might be said that Agni has never left the mind  of the true agni-hotrin. In a cowshed attached to the house most ahitagni keep  an “agni-hotra cow” for the two daily offerings. Although ghee may be offered,  or even curds or barley gruel, the libation is usually milk, liquid food, pre cious to families today as it was for cattle herders in antiquity. It is shared in 

Becoming Agni 197 

communion with Agni before any other food in the evening prior to the main  meal and again in the morning to begin a new day. Henk Bodewitz under stands the historic function of the agni-hotra as “a transference of the sun (the  heated milk) into Agni,” the evening or primary rite being a transport of the  sun “already weakened at the end of the day, through the dangerous darkness  and coolness of the night.”9 Konasima ahitagni appreciate this but their over whelming interest is in serving the culinary needs of Agni just as they supply  his body with kindling food and carry away from his sacred space the residue,  his ashes. 

If agni-hotra is not done for three days the fires are vicchinna, interrupted,  literally cut or broken, and rekindling must be done with specific expiations,  prayascitta, for the lapse. Legitimate occasions for a break in the routine  include deaths or births in the family causing pollution (asauca, Telugu maila)  when no ritual of any kind is permissible. Several provisions allow for a sus 

pension of rules and these are invoked liberally today when travel is easier  and families are more widely dispersed than a generation or two ago. As men tioned in Chapter 5, when the ahitagni is away from home he may perform  agni-hotra in advance and his wife will maintain the hearths: paksa homa for  a fortnight, masa homa for a month. If the husband is “out of station” for any  extended period he must return for one or the other moon isti since the wife  should not do this two-hour ritual alone. The use of expiation rites is frequent  and these consist of silent or muttered recitations (japa), meditations, and  offerings into the fire such as an isti known as ijya. The definition of a “con 

tinuous” or nitya-agnihotrin remains fuzzy since incapacitated elders who do  mantras only and not the milk offering into the fire may be included in the  prestigious category. 

Agni’s embers can be transferred not only hearth-to-hearth but also site-to site. Three terra-cotta pots are hung from slings, marked by initials with  names of each fire, and carried to the burning ground in a funeral proces sion, and the same procedure may be used by an ahitagni if he is traveling to  a sabha or a son’s marriage, for example. It is said that this occurs even on a  train, albeit with surreptitious care! A less dangerous (and disputed) solution  to the dilemma of maintaining agni-hotra while absent from home hearths is  a mystical-ritual drawing of the fire up and into the churning sticks, the two  arani, while they are held over it, or alternatively, into the body of the sacrifi cer himself, a technique known as atma-rohana. Either way the fires are then  released elsewhere on prepared hearths. 

As noted in Chapter 2, some in Konasima attribute this to outsider  families “who have incorrect procedures.” But ApSS 6.28.8–14 provides  details about the effect of mantras from TB 1 and 2 causing fire to rise and 

198 vedic voices 

descend. A homology between the churning sticks and the sacrificer’s body  is clear: both are temporary repositories of the fires. Perhaps here is the ori gin of the ubiquitous Hindu puja practice of open palms quickly touching  fire and then one’s face. This is Apastamba’s directive to the sacrificer before  going away overnight, breathing on them, praising them, touching them and  then his face. 

The benefits of agni-hotra are a frequent topic of conversation on pandit  verandahs. As the planet Earth appears to ease from day to night and then  back again at the two “joints” of twilight and dawn, so too the family home  participates with conjunctive rituals of sandhya-vandana and agni-hotra. “Even  if a house is full of faults or sins (dosa) from the perspective of geomancy  (vastu), agni-hotra fires will guard it, absolving the faults of the day in the eve 

ning rite, the faults of night-time at dawn.” This observation by Samavedam  came with concern about his own house when neither he nor his Vedapandit  sons aspired to setting fires. But the fact that three agni-hotrin neighbors were  within sight of his verandah eased his mind. 

The belief that nothing bad can happen in a house where agni-hotra is  performed, with assured personal protection, resembles nearby non-Brahman  folk who hang baskets containing the jute ropes of the neighborhood goddess  Gangamma to protect their houses from all misfortune. “Death does not reach  him . . . who offers agni-hotra,” according to Vadhula Sutra 3.27.10 It is small  wonder that ahitagni and patni may spend thousands of hours in the hearth  room feeding and caring for Agni, not only Lord of the house but protector of  the entire neighborhood as well. 

The agni-hotra should be done until physical incapacity prevents necessary  movement in the ritual room. Without kriyas, however, the rite can still con tinue with mantras only. Until he lost his memory Lanka did such a mantra  performance for years after his inability to stand up without pain. In their  declining years Pullela Laksminarayana and Kamesvari rekindled for agrayana every autumn, continued normal agni-hotra every day until the next amavasya or purnima, then did mantras without kriyas as a daily pattern. This recalls the  adhana in which a mental run-through of agni-hotra occurs even before fires  are established. 

Smoke from indoor fires may present problems. Baballa had very poor  eyesight. Duvvuri Yajulu went completely blind during the course of inter views for this survey, although his wicked sense of humor continued to make  Telugu puns on sneezing and being smoked, referring to dhuuma, smoke, as  his constant companion. At the time of agni-hotra there is a rule that an ahi tagni should not go beyond the village boundary and his wife should not go  beyond the border of the property for their house.11

### 4 Offerings to the New Moon, Full Moon,  and Constellations 

Nocturnal life under the glare of electric lighting is a new experience for many  in village India today just as it was a few generations ago in urban Delhi,  New York, or London. After sundown, untold thousands of generations knew  only the soft glow of an oil lamp supplementing light from stars and the fluc 

tuating moon. The ease and power of an electric bulb, once made available to  startle the night with human design and will, closed an era of cosmic depen dence. It also erased a specific kind of knowledge, the awareness of where and  when those spare sources of cosmic illumination appear. India, however, still  remembers what industrialized societies have largely forgotten: lunar cycles  and stellar rhythms. 

Despite multiple ancient calendars, some solar, some lunar, there is a uni versal division in India between light and dark, waxing and waning, of the  sun over the course of a year and the moon for the duration of each month,  both holding consciousness of the human position within the flux. There is  also in India still today near universal concern for astrological markers of stel lar and planetary movements, recorded in birth and death horoscopes and in  astrological pamphlets (pancanga) consulted daily by astrologers and priests  for correct timing of events. Again, the Vedic tradition preserves a singular  response to such cosmic rhythms, extensive sacrifices known as naksatra isti (naksatresti), offerings to twenty-eight constellations, one by one, requiring as  many as forty days of performance. 

To address first the lunar offerings, one of the landmark rituals of  Vedic life in antiquity and today is the fortnightly tracking of the moon’s  progress. Every two weeks an agni-hotrin performs an offering known as  darsa-purna-masa, “new- (or) full-moon (sacrifice).”12 As the solar cycle is a  routine easing from day to night and back again at the joints of sunset and  sunrise, so also the lunar pattern, with an expansion from hours to days,  impresses human awareness with a similar shift from bright to dark and  back again. So important is this ritual observance of lunar swing that this  isti became a paradigm (prakrti) for offerings in general, excepting only the  animal and soma sacrifices. 

As Agni and Prajapati receive the evening agni-hotra while Surya and  Prajapati take the morning one, so too there are multiple recipients of  darsa-purna-masa, the dual divinities Agni-Soma and Indra-Agni as well as  Agni or Prajapati alone.13 Offerings are melted butter (ghee) and purodasa,  pounded rice flour mixed with water into dough and baked in clumps spooned 

200 vedic voices 

onto pottery rings over open coals. The result is something of a cross between  a small rounded loaf of bread and a pancake. 

Four priests suffice—hotr, adhvaryu, agnidhra, and brahman—the sacrifi cer serving as one, sons and neighboring colleagues filling in the other posts.  The wife, with several tasks and occasional brief lines to recite, is seated close  by the garha-patya. Lanka noted a stopgap procedure in which it could be done  alone, but help is considered appropriate and a full staff is desired when an  isti is adjacent to a harvest festival or animal sacrifice. Every fortnight Duvvuri  Surya Prakasa left his temple recitation duties in Rajahmundry for regular bus  trips down to Sriramapuram and Vyaghresvaram to assist his father and then  Bulusu Kamesvara, just as the latter reciprocated with Pullela Laksminaraya  within the hamlet of Vyaghresvaram itself. 

There is a difference between the two offerings as well as the divine  recipients, and modifications for a soma-sacrificer. For some in Konasima  the new-moon rite calls for milk and curds while the full moon involves the  purodasa alone. Constant recitation of mantras, cleaning and heating sacrifi 

cial implements, tidying up the altar area, organizing kindling and enclosing  sticks, and spreading sacred grasses take up most of the two hours and the  offerings themselves are of brief duration. Requisite utensils include a sickle  for cutting grasses, long-handled wooden paddle (upavesa) for managing the  coals, a small wooden sword (sphya) for marking and digging the altar, and  a winnowing fan (surpa), usually of woven reeds although Satyavati uses a  beautiful brass one when she tosses the rice before sifting and pounding the  grains to make dough. The adhvaryu braids and binds a sweeping-up brush  of darbha grass, the veda, known mischievously in Konasima as “Brahma’s  moustache.” As the vedi altar is female, so the veda brush is a masculine sym bol. The brush is but one of an array of various grasses such as barhis that are  essential, some of them bundled into batches (prastara) and strewn from point  to point throughout the isti. The deep antiquity of these ritual procedures is  borne out by the comparative significance of grass and twig bundles employed  by ancient Iranian sacrificers. 

Recipients of the main offerings—Agni, Soma, Indra, Prajapati—are all  males. It should not be surprising, however, that a strong presence of god desses and feminine powers along with featured roles for the wife lies just  under the surface. The full and new moons have been addressed as goddesses  from the time of the Atharva Veda (7.79 and 7.80, respectively, for amavasya and paurnamasi (purnima)). Polar events for a life-body, conception and death,  draw together a complex symbol system of soma, the moon, impregnation,  destinies of the unborn, the always hovering ancestors, and cooked food that  is shared with invited deities.

Becoming Agni 201 

The pinda-pitr-yajna, offerings to the ancestors, are included within the  new-moon ritual (ApSS 1.7.1–10.15), although they are abbreviated today. In that  sense the concatenation of birth, death, and rebirth has been loosened. But  feminine powers play several roles. A special portion of a purodasa loaf is the  ida, cut for the goddess Ida, soaked in ghee and offered to her, with remnants  consumed by the priests and sacrificer (although not the wife). In the ritual  known as patni-samyaja the wives of the deities (Indrani and others) are recipi 

ents of offerings, along with Soma, Tvastr, and Agni as lord of the household,  made in the garha-patya by the adhvaryu while the sacrificer’s wife touches his  arm with a long blade of darbha grass. 

Prajapati is not the only deity associated with conception and birth. If the  sacrificer and wife seek to gain a son they may offer to Raka. Anasuya gave  birth to seven consecutive sons after the first child, a girl. Satyavati produced  six sons, and Surya, who conceived fourteen times, successfully raised five  sons. Raka may well have been frequently sought. She is one of a trio of rather  shadowy females—Raka, Sinivali, and Kuhu (Gungu instead of Kuhu in RV  2.32.8)—that joins the better-known goddess Anumati and the god Dhatr to  serve as shapers or arrangers of childbirth in cosmic orientation. The quartet  of feminine powers is divided for the lunar rites, eventually with Raka and  Anumati on full-moon and preceding day, Kuhu and Sinivali on new-moon  and preceding day (cf. TS 1.8.8.1; 3.3.11.13–20; 3.4.9.1; MSS 8.11). In other words,  each lunar observance has two days, the fourteenth and fifteenth of a fort night, the latter being completion of full or new moon (Raka or Kuhu), the  former being an almost full or new moon (Anumati or Sinivali). 

Their aggregate might be construed as Vedic midwives of destiny. The  sketchy but revealing preoccupations of the original trio may indicate a  Proto-Indo-European background that included the spinning and weaving of  individual fate, even immortality. Raka, for example, sews with an unbreakable  (or unstoppable) needle, a trait repeated from RV 2.32.4 through the Vedas to  the sutras, perhaps in connection with garments of destiny or the thread of life  itself. Sinivali, who places the embryo (garbha) in the womb (RV 10.284.2; AV  5.25.3) also shapes clay for the fire-pan carried by the sacrificer, a womb that  gives birth to his new being of fire as he becomes Agni in the agni-cayana.14 

The patni is highlighted when she sits, knees raised, to be encircled by the  agnidhra and adhvaryu (ApSS 2.5.2–6) with a loop of three strands of munja grass. This yoktra, halter or yoke, suggests that she is now restrained like a  domestic animal, and indeed in a different sakha, SB 1.3.1.13 understands the  cord as such, as well as a dividing line between the pure upper half of her body  and the impure lower half. This gloss points to a tension between seeing the  auspicious wife as pure vessel destined to receive seed and produce children, 

202 vedic voices 

and impure woman, unfit to direct her gaze toward the pot of ghee, a sub stance homologized to retas, male seed, semen. 

The Taittiriya tradition, however, contains a positive valorization of this  act in TB 3.3.3.2–3, directing comparative attention to the upanayana cord  and initiatory symbolism.15 It was in fact Subbalaksmi, first among others,  who made the unsolicited connection between the grass belts of the patni and  the brahmacarin (the latter described in Chapter 2). Both are initiations, she  insisted, the boy into Veda learning, the wife into enhanced ritual life. Another  occurrence of an encircling grass belt, noted in Chapter 5, is the bride being  led by the groom to perform marital vows by the fire. Mircea Eliade noted that  binding is a significant expression in the history of religions, carrying with it  the antithesis, loosing.16 The cord that restrains also sets free, and the freedom  obtained by release becomes perhaps the cynosure of South Asian religious  expression.17 In this context, just as the girl-bride is momentarily bound, then  released to become a woman-wife, so the wife in a yoktra sits in a posture of  incipient power, about to become co-sacrificer. As noted earlier the yoktra belt  may replace the wife for agni-hotra when her husband is away. Other examples  of binding and loosing of inanimate as well as living components of sacrifice  will appear in many of the rituals still to be discussed, as for example, drums  in the vaja-peya.18 

The wife stands after she loosens the grass belt and recites, addressing  Agni first in the garha-patya fire and then the wives of the gods, prior to offer ings to them (the patni-samyaja). These memorized phrases from the Taittiriya  Samhita are the results of several sessions of instruction, usually by her hus band. There is a special moment in either lunar rite or in iterations of this  isti in other rituals, when the wife directs her gaze to the pot of offering ghee,  closes her eyes, then opens them again. As Duvvuri Yajulu commented on the  groom-husband taking a long time truly to see his bride-wife for the person  she is (Chapter 3), so this sightless, wise pandit observed here: “She sees the  ghee in the pot with closed eyes.” It is particularly poignant that a female with  a uterus (pot) so visualizes the contents (seed, new life) before anyone else. 

Further attention to the symbolism of procreation, especially of a male  child, is drawn when the hotr picks up the symbol of virility, the veda brush,  “Brahma’s moustache,” and tosses it into the lap of the patn. She tosses it  back until it is exchanged three times. The hotr recites and she replies that  she loosened the grass belt to unite with her husband (and produce a child).  Mitranarayana stressed the significance of this veda that is braided and later  unbraided, that is, bound and released: “The offerings will not be actualized  unless it is present. Once the karma is finished its stalks are undone and each  one is strewn from the garha-patya to the ahavaniya. The rest of it is given 

Becoming Agni 203 

to the patni. The veda has outlived its significance.” Stephanie Jamison cites  sutras other than Apastamba directing the wife to place some brush stalks  between her thighs in an even more physical semblance of intercourse.19 

Both lunar offerings and their alloforms in other rituals afford ample  opportunities for the adhvaryu as well as the sacrificer to express certain  personal desires other than children and prosperity. Regarding the pouring  (aghara) of ghee from a ladle into the ahavaniya fire, ApSS 2.14.1–7 states the  correct procedure and then follows with several alterations. For example, one  who seeks heaven (svarga, vyoman) should pour more than the usual amount  from a ladle held above the waistline, thus enhancing the result. In the other  direction, a broken or diffuse flow of ghee instead of the proper continuous  one, done with mental concentration, is a ritual-magical “mistake” presumed  to promote the death of a rival sacrificer. In Chapter 3 rivaling families of soma sacrificers were mentioned and this frequent and paradigmatic lunar rite is an  occasion for animosities to rise beyond imprecations into actions.20 On a dif 

ferent plane, such offering of ghee may bring to the surface the special myster ies of outer sight and inner vision. “By closing the eyes while pouring and then looking,” as Duvvuri Yajulu noted, “one perceives things as they really are.” 

In addition to tracking the daily course of the sun and monthly prog ress of the moon there is concern about naksatra and graha. The former are  twenty-eight asterisms or constellations, ranging in size from a single star  to the six stars of Krttika, the Pleiades, the whole series being the houses in  which the changing moon briefly resides. The graha are the aggregate of nine  planets, “seizers,” including both the sun and the moon, the five visible plan ets, and Rahu and Ketu, invisible but notorious eclipse nodes. 

Knowledge of all these celestial assemblies requires professional consul tation of current pancanga, astrological manuals, readily available in paper  pamphlets in bazaars but sufficiently cryptic to counter lay access. Lanka  in Nedunuru and Baballa in Sriramapuram provided expertise and the  latter at present is succeeded by grandson Prasad. Establishment of fires,  life-cycle rites, lunar and harvest offerings, soma and other rituals must all  be performed under appropriate constellations or expiations are required  for improper timing. A newborn child is given a secret naksatra name, as  ApGS 6.15.1–3 details. Like the planets of sharp concern to the general popu 

lace, naksatra have clear personalities, some known to be ugra, terrible, cruel,  while others are mrdu, gentle and soft; in other words some are inauspicious,  others are auspicious. 

The naksatra are mentioned in the Rg Veda and Atharva Veda 19.7.2–5  names them all but it is the ritual tradition that best honors them. TS 4.4.10.1–3  lists twenty-seven from Krttika (the Pleiades) to Apabharani in the context of 

204 vedic voices 

setting the fifth layer of bricks for the agni-cayana. A brick and deity are named  for each, Agni first of all and Yama, judge of the dead, the concluding deity.  Construction of the great altar of Agni is a soma sacrifice and of particular  interest to the ahitagni is a belief that all the constellations together outline  the body of Prajapati. It is Prajapati as well as Agni with whom the sacrificer  is homologized. 

Interestingly, it is the Brahmana text of the Taittiriyins that features  twenty-eight naksatra with its addition of Abhijit to the Samhita list. TB  3.1.1–6 also changes several names such as the last one, Bharani instead of  Apabharani, with reference to the bearers of the dead. And in fact half of  the naksatra, numbers 15–28, are in the camp of Yama, lord of the dead, the  first half, numbers 1–14, assigned to the Devas, the gods. Significant also is a  change with respect to lunar powers, the full moon following the fourteenth  naksatra, and the new moon, always a feature in death and ancestral rites, fol lowing the twenty-eighth naksatra. Dumont attributes these changes to a pos 

sible desire to reconcile the thirty-day solar month with the slightly shorter  lunar month.21 

It is Baudhayana who provides the sutra that is followed in Andhra, BSS  28.3–4 recommending that the sacrificer consign his fires to the arani and  churn out new fire on another hearth. Just as the sacrificer in the agni-cayana identifies with Agni, Prajapati, the year, and the encompassed cosmos, so the  performer of non-obligatory isti offerings to the naksatra declares the same  homologies. 

One by one, in the naksatra-isti sacrifice that requires approximately forty  days, each constellation is praised and propitiated. The sacrificer pays close  attention to the rising and setting of both sun and moon in order to keep  proper timing. Kapilavayi Venkatesvara stated the purpose directly:  “These  isti are done to control and subjugate the naksatra so that all of them will  be beneficial to the sacrificer.” The isti to the naksata usually starts on Caitra  new-moon day under a particular constellation and proceeds with a differ 

ent devata each day, for example, Agni for Krttika, Brahma for Rohini, Soma  the moon for Margasirsa, and so on. Baballa did this in the early 1960s.  Lanka, Mitranarayana, and Kapilavayi Yajnesvara Agnihotra all supervised the  lengthy rites that may include a goat sacrifice on the final day. Dendukuri  Agnihotra was yajamana for his naksatra-isti in Hyderabad in 2001 when he  was sixty-three. The adhana is prerequisite, not agni-stoma. The rite is usually  done by older pandits with menopausal wives since a young or middle-aged  wife would menstruate within the required thirty or forty days and no protec tion from diksa is afforded. The rite would then be broken and the performers  damaged.22

### 5 The Agrayana Harvest Sacrifices 

In some drought-stricken areas of Andhra and other states of South India  hungry folk chastise their deities, even threaten to abandon their worship  because they have withheld life-saving rains. Not so in Konasima’s garden  zone of abundant Godavari waters where first-fruit harvests are thrilling occa 

sions and opportunities to reward the gods with first-taste offerings. The bag ging of new rice, ripened in the autumn crop, brings a joyous festival when  everyone thanks the goddess in Durga-puja and the Vaidika ahitagni perform  agrayana in a sala, a bamboo screened area just outside each house. It is done  on a new-moon day following much the same procedure as in the lunar rite  that may either precede or succeed it. As noted in Chapter 5, aging and ailing  ahitagni observe this new-rice ritual to the furthest limit of their capacities,  rekindle fires and perform isti and expiations just for this quintessential cer emony. Baballa and Sundari managed their last agrayana in 1990 when he was  eighty-seven and she was eighty-one. No one eats the new rice until it has been  offered in sacrifice and then only in proper ritual attire and a state of purity.  In the spring, barley is harvested in a minor version of agrayana and a third  grain, syamaka, a rainy season millet, is also honored in first fruits with Soma  the deity (cf. ApSS 6.29.10). Autumn agrayana involves new-rice dough puro dasa made on twelve sherds offered to Indra-and-Agni, another one made on  a single sherd for a second dual deity, Heaven-and-Earth (Dyava and Prthivi),  and a cooked rice portion for the Visvedevas, the All-gods. 

For many years before advancing to srauta lives Konasima pandits observed  the domestic form of agrayana (cf. ApGS 7.19.6–7). This was on the aupasana fire with Agni Svistakrt, Agni as the maker of proper sacrifices, added to a  quartet of recipient deities in the earlier srauta schedule laid out in ApSS  6.29.1–31.14. In the domestic rite new rice grains are cooked as sthali-paka in  milk or water. At one point the sacrificer swallows a mouthful of new grains,  then makes a ball (pinda) of cooked rice meant for the gods and tosses it up  onto the roof of his house, perhaps for ancestors, perhaps to protect the dwell 

ing and family from hungry ghosts who have a tendency to perch on roofs.  Apastamba does not detail this practice but pandits say it is common before  anyone in the family eats new rice. 

Duvvuri Yajulu was fond of describing a special tradition he guarded well,  one stretching back, he said, “many generations before my great-grandfather.”  A special yellow-green (paccal) millet, grown on rising upland soil dependent  only on rain, not irrigation flooding, is offered along with the new rice or  barley in agrayana, homa applying to both autumn and spring seasons per 

missible at the same time. He was asked: Why do you add this millet to rice206 vedic voices 

or barley? “It promotes vigor (pusti) in one’s semen (indriya),” he explained  and continued in colloquial Telugu agrarian terms: “A lot of treatment is nec essary and all the work on the grains has to be done by the somi-devamma alone. The deities of both seasons are always pleased by this offering!” Surya,  who delivered fourteen infants, must have prepared this special grain quite  properly. Again, as with the two lunar offerings, the samskara, and many other  rituals, proliferation of children is at the forefront. The samidheni verses of  the standard isti are increased from fifteen to seventeen, the sacred number  of Prajapati, lord of procreation. And Soma, recipient of the millet offering,  is both the deity and the sacred juice so readily homologized to retas, another  Sanskrit word for semen. 

An effortless method of performing agrayana is well known but not  favored. The agni-hotra cow could be fed with new grain, then milked, and  that milk offered in either evening or morning agni-hotra.23A firstborn calf  suggested by Apastamba as daksina to the adhvaryu is scarcely realized today  and an alternative, a piece of cloth or a dish of honey and curds suffices.24 The  daksina does not matter so much as the desire to live in harmony with the  rhythms of nature as Baballa and Lanka, both lifelong cultivators, expressed  it so many times. Laurie Patton has an appropriate summation: “The gods  are given food and return it through their natural bounty; thus, the ecology of  sacrificial food production and consumption is the central guiding metaphor  for the survival of earthly and celestial worlds.”25 

### 6 The Catur-masya Seasonal Rituals 

Another full set of rituals is the observation of a new three-month season every  four months, the series known as catur-masya. In Konasima there is near uni formity of days and nights, twelve hours each, the sun rising or setting about  six o’clock year round with none of the daylight and darkness fluctuations of  climates farther north or south. The seasons change, however, each with a  special character, the rapidly accelerating heat of the New Year from March to  June (Caitra, Vaisakha, Jyestha), the breaking of heat with the monsoon rainy  season (Asadha, Sravana, Bhadrapada), a cool-down for the autumn harvest  (Asvina, Karttika, Margasirsa), and the coldest months giving way to spring  and another New Year’s festival on Ugadi (Pausa, Magha, Phalguna). 

The formative period of Vedic India, developing in the northwest of the  subcontinent, marked seasonal changes every four months (catur masya), with  rites in the isti pattern connected to sowing and harvesting of crops in spring  (vasanta), rains (varsa), and autumn (hemanta). The series is concluded with  the suna-siriya ritual and offerings to Vayu, Indra Sunasiriya, and Surya. The 

Becoming Agni 207 

two deities Suna and Sira occur in RV 4.57, an agrarian hymn addressed to  them as well as to Ksetrapati, lord of the crop field, and Sita, the plowed fur row. There is also mention of Parjanya and Indra, responsible for necessary  rains for fruitful harvests, and Pusan, bringer of prosperity, one closely related  to the sun. Wealth in the form of plentiful harvests and herds appears to be the  

raison d’être of this early hymn and the seasonal rituals that ensued. Although their seasons are at variance with the Rg Vedic series Konasima  pandits are entirely familiar with all the deities and their forms of blessings.  It must be said, however, that they have treated the seasonal rites with circum spection, performing the series once only or not at all and preferring to invest  more energy and emotion in the agrayana harvest ritual. Baballa and Lanka  did each of the catur-masya a single time while Bulusu Cayanulu, considerably  vexed in later years about their absence from his record, seemed always to be  planning implementation in the form of a single five-day ritual. In February  1992, five years before his sudden heart attack, Cayanulu’s explanation hinged  on the degree of difficulty involved: “They are not straightforward rituals like  agni-stoma. They look at first like ordinary isti but under investigation one  finds constant important links to maintain, intricate ones. A  tough rite, it  includes a sacrifice to the ancestors so it is the equivalent of going to Kasi or  Gaya. It should be done at least once in one’s life.” He may or may not have  known about procedures for folding all the rites into one or two days. The catur-masya preserve a number of intriguing, presumably ancient  features, of which there is opportunity here for barest mention. The three  of them, spaced every four months on full-moon days, are vaisva-deva, Varuna-praghasa, and saka-medha, respectively, initiating spring, the rainy sea son, and autumn. The vaisva-deva ritual at the outset of the New Year with  Caitya full moon begins a long series of offerings in recognition of Vaisvanara  (Agni) and Parjanya, god of rain. It involves the pleasant task of eating honey,  and concludes next day with the normal offering to the full moon. The vaisva-deva rite occupies an important position in its own right, regard less of its role as first of the catur-masya. For ordinary householders it is a  significant grhya (domestic) offering of cooked food to all the gods in a single  ritual. Some see it as penance for acts of violence committed on a daily basis.  It is a rite that Subbalaksmi did twice a day for most of her life. On the other  hand, for Veda pandits and wives aspiring to a srauta career it may become  the first step toward adhana, the setting of hearths for an agni-hotra career. In  the latter case it is a full-blown isti with four rtvij and a duration of three days.  Duvvuri Surya Prakasa Avadhani and Kanaka Durga took this step early in  2007 with Mitranarayana as adhvaryu and mentor. Both observed fasting with  only hot milk and porridge at night. They anticipated adhana and agni-stoma

208 vedic voices 

in 2008 but in the end were unable to follow through. Kapilavayi Rama Sastri  and Maruti did vaisva-deva in 2014 in anticipation of setting hearths in 2016.  Rama Sastri compares vaisva-deva to the early childhood samskara, first feed ing of rice, anna-prasana. Cooked rice is the medium for the baby’s entry into  a lifetime of eating anna every day. The ceremony of vaisva-deva is a preamble  as well: yajamana and patni begin a pattern of daily offerings, one that should  climax with soma. 

To return to the catur-masya series, perhaps most magnetic of the three  seasonal rites is the sharing of a barley meal offering to Varuna in hopes  of evading his snares (pasa) and punishment for known or unknown sins.  This second seasonal rite, Varuna-praghasa, involves five priests, adhvaryu,  prati-prasthatr, hotr, agnidhra, and brahman. Small images of a ram and ewe  are fashioned of barley flour paste and later sacrificed by the adhvaryu and  prati-prasthatr, respectively. Abruptly, the prati-prasthatr asks the wife “How  many lovers do you have?” and proclaims, having learned the names of each,  that Varuna should snare them, evidently freeing the sacrificer from further  cuckoldry. Other texts have the wife hold up the number of fingers or blades  of grass that tally her amours. There is no hint that Varuna should punish  the wife. 

Much is made in commentarial literature about the cleansing effect of  confession, sin being here removed not by punishment but rather by truth fulness. The inference that she indeed has lovers parallels the assumption  that the sacrificer has enemies, sexual rivalry overlapping with ritual competi tion. Also fashioned of barley flour are tiny pots, one for each relative of the  sacrificer plus an extra one for the unborn, containing gruel of course grains  (karambha), all held in a winnowing fan (surpa) balanced on the head of the  sacrificer or patni. Before offering into the daksina-agni both recite TS 1.8.3d.  The patni unties the yoktra from her waist with TS 1.1.10g and together sacrifi cer and wife take a concluding bath. 

There are numerous expressions from a cult of the dead in the catur-masya and one suspects that hesitation in performance of the full series may be  reluctance to engage with Mrtyu. The catur-masya in the eighth segment of  Apastamba’s sutras flow as a continuum, vaisva-deva (1–4), Varuna-praghasa (5–18), saka-medha (9–12), straight into pitr-yajna (13–16) ancestor offerings.  In Varuna-praghasa there are offerings into the southern fire, use of the  winnowing fan, “dismemberment” of two flour-paste animals in lieu of real  ones, communion shares of offerings with relatives and invited Brahmans,  and special offerings of karambha to Pusan, pathfinder for the dead, one  known to prefer mushy food like porridge. The third seasonal rite is the  saka-medha that concludes with pitr-yajna, sacrifice to the ancestors who 

Becoming Agni 209 

dwell in their heavenly world, pitr-loka. Again relatives are fed, this time  with a rice mess instead of barley, and balls (pinda) of cooked rice and barley  are offered to the paternal trio of father, grandfather, and great-grandfather,  then the further trio of ancestors, and finally the Visvedevas, “all gods,”  served with rice that sticks to the offering hand. All of this occurs on a new  screened-off altar with fire taken from the daksina-agni, mantras expressed  soundlessly, sacred threads switched to left shoulders, circumambulations  with left side toward the altar. The departed receive food, but with entirely  different procedures. 

Interesting to note are distinctions among those who do the catur-masya based on the sacrificial history of their pitr, ancestors. Those ancestors who  performed no extended sacrifices after adhana are the agnisvatta fathers;  those who performed only lesser sacrifices (agrayana, for example) are the  barhisad fathers; while those who went on to the agni-stoma and offered soma are the somavant fathers. Thus in catur-masya performance Lanka, who had no  ahitagni forbears, addressed a different aggregate of pitr from that to whom  Baballa made offerings. 

Subsequent to the trio of seasonal rites there is an offering to Tryambaka  (Rudra) and then the suna-siriya ritual with offerings of milk to Vayu and  purodasa for Indra Sunasiriya and Surya. A plow and various domestic ani mals are recommended as gifts to the priests. According to ApSS 8.7.5 and  11.7 a bull is given and cows should be sacrificed but of course this is not  done today. Animal sacrifice with goats is one thing, cows are unthinkable.  One of the two months designated for Varuna-praghasa is Sravana, the month  when a goat sacrifice is required, the pasu-bandha that is independent of soma pressing. Interestingly, although flour-paste animals are “sacrificed” as part  of the Varuna-praghasa no one suggests that such might be done with bovines  as well. 

To sum up the seasonal rituals, as in agrayana, prosperity in the form of  bountiful harvests, milk, and wool appears to be the major focus, with strong  attention to communication with the ancestors who are related to the seasons  and indeed the full cycle of the year. Staying on the correct side of Varuna  and other punishers such as the Maruts is an additional aim. Ganesh Thite  makes the case that catur-masya have to do primarily with healing, seasonal  changes signaling the arrival of various diseases.26 Jan Heesterman, on the  other hand, sees the ritual series as “a victorious course through the universe  both in respect to time (seasons) and . . . space (the three worlds), by which the  sacrificer encompasses and becomes the whole of the universe.” In any case it  appears that attention to ancestors is very much at the core of these seasonal  rites.27

### 7 The First Soma and Animal Sacrifice,  Agni-stoma 

Baballa, so often equipped with the right phrase for the occasion, drew upon his  experience as soma-yaji, soma-sacrificer, alongside his father and five soma-yaji brothers, and observed that this momentous step into agni-stoma permits the  easy progress of a bullock cart on a well-grooved road. He belonged to an elite  older generation that cherished the drinking of soma as a closed-circuit drama  demanding only the purest and most accomplished of participants to serve  the gods. As in his reluctance to accept daksina from students and his refusal  of TTD employment, he frequently turned down invitations from local and  regional pandits to be a priest in their sacrifices and accepted only the role of  sadasya who does not drink soma. His dread was the possibility of error. 

This ritual that Mitranarayana so energetically performed at age twenty two and Mitranarayana’s father-in-law Lanka later approached with some  trepidation in midlife, is known as the praise (stoma) of Agni, honoring him  with the juice of that heaven-born sacred plant soma. As noted in Chapter 2  this ritual has pride of place: yajna, the generic Sanskrit term for “sacrifice,”  is the reference in coastal Andhra to agni-stoma, almost as if there were no  other sacrifice. Also known as jyoti-stoma, the praise of light, it is a sacrifice  with a single day of pressing and offering soma but requires five busy days on  an extended sacrificial arena with the full complement of the sixteen priests  listed in Table 2.3 of Chapter 2. As the procedure for the two lunar isti offer 

ings became the model for all sacrifices except soma and animal, so agni-stoma became the template for all additional soma sacrifices. A least one full year of  agni-hotra is required of the householder pair before undertaking agni-stoma,  

although, as mentioned earlier, a few pandits abbreviated that schedule.28 This paradigmatic rite is an elaborate drama with thousands of prepara tions, major and minor offerings, chants, and recitations. Apastamba devotes  106 chapters to agni-stoma (ApSS 10.1 to 13.25), more attention than given to  any other ritual. Another twenty-eight chapters (7.1–28) cover the independent  pasu-bandha, the animal sacrifice, an analogue being a prominent feature of  agni-stoma. And of course authorities squabble over which of their hefty com pendia of inherited instructions will govern each procedure. There is space  here only for selected highlights. In order to appreciate the spectacle of an  ahitagni’s first soma and animal sacrifice, however, one must envision the  stage, essentially a projection of the householders’ agni-hotra room outdoors  onto a spacious maha-vedi or great altar, including an agni-ksetra, field of fire.  Orientation is extremely important, the eastern compass point being the pri mary direction.

Becoming Agni 211 

In Plan 6.1 of this chapter, Kapilavayi Venkatesvara (KV) has drawn four  rectangles to represent bamboo sheds over essential areas. Observing the  chart’s alignment from west (W) to east (E) these are the prag-vamsa, sadas,  havir-dhana, and uttara-vedi. Measurements are done with the body of the  yajamana as scale: the aratni yardstick or measuring rope is one-fifth of his  height and two sacrificial poles, the audumbari in the center of the sadas and  the yupa, a vata tree on the east border for the animal sacrifice, are exactly his  height. For the agrayana harvest sacrifice a bamboo-and-straw-mat hut was  constructed just outside the house and fires were transferred there. The same  arrangement is made for agni-stoma except now the venue is an out-of-season  crop field borrowed for the occasion, dimensions are far larger, and roofed  structures for fires and participants are erected during initial days. 

First is the prag-vamsa (or pracina-vamsa), a bamboo pole-and-rafter shelter  to cover the three fires maintained in their house by the co-sacrificing husband  and wife, these fires now being shifted outdoors onto brick hearths. The wife’s  corner (patni-sala) is in the southwest within reach of the cooking fire (round  garha-patya) as well as daksina-agni (D-shaped southern fire). The square on  Plan 6.1 on the east side (E) of the prag-vamsa represents the ahavaniya offer 

ing fire. South of the ahavaniya is the initial place of the mancam, a Telugu  word for the movable bed that carries soma stalks, a litter conveyance also  known as a bandi, cart, or asandi, throne. Doors to enter and exit the shelter  are on the W to E line. 

Next built is the sadas (or sadasya), erected to cover six priests (named S  to N the maitra-varuna, hotr, brahmanac-chamsin, potr, nestr, and acchavaka).  They work at six dhisniya,29 fires ignited on low mud brick hearths, facing east  (E) during the chanting of twelve stotra and reciting of twelve follow-up sastra.  Flanking the sadas are two more fires ignited on raised earth excavated from a  pit (catvala) dug off the northeast corner of the agni-ksetra. On the north (N) is  the agnidhriya for the agnidhra, a kindling priest who distributes embers to  various hearths and tends all fires. His fire makes the total of dhisniya seven.  The other is the marja-liya for symmetry on the south side, a kind of kitch enette meant for cleaning implements. A rubbish dump, the utkara, is dug  to collect debris such as used grasses and other sweepings. Just west of the  dhisniya line is the audumbari pole. 

The next construction (KV’s third rectangle on Plan 6.1) is the havir-dhana,  a soma factory with roofing to protect the stalks and pressing equipment (four  stones, boards, animal skins) required for three preparations of soma. The  bed (mancam) of cuttings that was prominently placed by the offering fire in  the prag-vamsa is now carried onto the south side of the havir-dhana and read 

ied for action. (KV has placed it twice on Plan 6.1.) Four holes (uparava) are 

212 vedic voices 

excavated as sounding chambers beneath it. A curious moment occurs: the  adhvaryu and sacrificer are on hands and knees, their right arms deep in these  holes to touch fingers and test the correct depth. Earth from the holes serves  as a small mound in the southeast corner, the khara, holding soma containers,  eleven camasa (including one for the sacrificer) and twenty graha cups. The  table is now set. 

As they did the night before their adhana establishment of fires the couple  remains awake, the sacrificer in the havir-dhana and his wife in the patni-sala.  Directly east of the havir-dhana KV has marked the uttara-vedi, locus of the  main altar, a new ahavaniya offering fire. In the middle of the east border,  the farthest point east of the entire ritual field, stands the yupa, a second pole  meant to tie the animal destined for sacrifice. It is a vata tree shaped by a car 

penter into an octagonal post, exactly on the W-E line from the garha-patya fire  through the centers of all the shelters. To the north is the samitra, the place  where the samitr will smother the goat. 

The result of all this labor is a magnification of the indoor agni-hotra room,  preserving the same orientation, with a lateral spreading out of fires, now  eight on the north-south axis, six dhisniya hearths under the sadas roof plus  the two border fires. A transposition occurs among the essential three house 

hold fires: the prag-vamsa serves as a launching pad to make a garha-patya,  cooking hearth, out of the former ahavaniya offering fire. This requires a  new ahavaniya hearth to be established farther east on what is now called the  uttara-vedi. A crucial moment is the shift of that offering fire eastward to the  uttara-vedi. 

Having established the arena and its parts, our attention is now drawn to  the participants. A remarkable procedure on the first day is the diksa for the  sacrificer and wife, a consecration ritual famous in anthropology and the his tory of religions for its initiatory structure and striking symbolism of rebirth.  They sit on black antelope hides inside separate enclosures without speaking.  Their agni-hotra are suspended but in a sense they are themselves fire (ApSS  10.13.1) and are maintained only by the offerings of agni-hotra: milk and per haps ghee, a few grains cooked in milk, or curds. In other words, they are fast ing. Their fists remain clenched as if they are embryos subsisting on mother’s  milk inside their womb-like huts. They may not bathe and in the fierce heat  of April–May may scratch their heads and bodies only with an antelope horn. 

Each is bound as in the isti described earlier for lunar rites, he with  a mekhala, she with a yoktra, bonds that are loosened only when they have  advanced to a higher state with the final bath. In Jan Gonda’s words: “The  initiatory birth which implies death to profane existence enables [them] to  gain sacred knowledge and wisdom, a higher stage of existence and access 

Becoming Agni 213 

to a heavenly life.” They are in “a temporary state of higher sanctity.”30 The  wife recites the mantra she has learned: “Praying for benevolence, offspring,  good fortune, myself, in devotion to Agni, I gird myself for ritual and religious  merit.”31 The sacrificer receives a staff of fig-tree wood (udumbara) similar to  the one he used in his boyhood upanayana initiation and both don white cloth  head covering. 

This consecration readies them for soma, a deified plant with a storied past.  The mythology and cult of a mountain or heaven-grown plant that provides  poetic inspiration to priests, battle fury to warriors, and immortality to all may  be of ancient Indo-European origin. Certainly the parallel Avestan haoma and  Vedic soma cults indicate an Indo-Iranian development, a cult of drinking  *sauma associated with the warrior god Indra. A late phase of the Bactria and  Margiana Archeological Complex (BMAC) that had begun in southern Central  Asia early in the third millennium bce resulted in assembly of the RV hymns  between c. 1750 and 1500 bce. The RV remains the best source with 120 hymns  devoted to Soma, including the entire ninth mandala. RV 10.119 is Indra’s  famous boast of being high on soma and RV 4.26 and 27 depict the theft of  soma from the highest heaven by an eagle, a myth that has a sparkling legacy  in Sanskrit epics, Puranas, and other literary records as well as folklore.32 

In Konasima soma-lata is the Telugu ritual name for a common green  leafless creeper, tiga (Asclepias acida), purchased from one who harvests and  carts it into the agrahara, then faces a brutal bargaining session that drives the  reward down from a “soma-cow” to a bag of paddy. The seller is then formulai 

cally beaten out of the agrahara as the stalks are bundled in white cloth and  loaded onto a black antelope hide over the woven cords of the mancam des tined for the havir-dhana by way of the prag-vamsa. The cuttings are sprinkled  with water and pounded with stones over the uparava holes to make them  swell as the four echo chambers reverberate. Their juices flow through woolen  strainers into a wooden tub that serves as resource for all libations. Water,  ghee, milk, curds, barley, or honey may be mixed in as the juice passes from  tub to pot to cup. At one point priests form a moving serpentine line, crouch ing on haunches, each holding the shoulder of the one before, all chanting the  bahis-pavamana, a stotra about the purity and brightness of milk-blended soma arriving at the altar. They see themselves as stealthy hunters of an antelope,  stalking the very sacrifice they are now performing! 

The camasa wooden cups have been crafted by a carpenter, each with  distinctive shape or handle for the sacrificer and ten priests identified as  cupbearers (camasin). Like the soma-lata creepers themselves these cups are  believed to swell from the potent juice that is quaffed by the gods, Indra,  Agni, Vayu, the Asvin pair, and others. These swollen cups also serve the 

214 vedic voices 

ancestors, the pitr, Fathers, who arrive for their share.33 At a certain moment  in all the drinking of the remains of offerings to the deities (sacrificer and  priests are actually receiving their ucchista, leftovers), the mysterious god dess Ida, a personification of sacrificial remnants, is toasted as the eleven  camasin clink their cups together. The undiluted juice of coastal Andhra tiga is bitter. No one reports, even after the third pressing, hallucinogenic or  stimulant effects. The age of poetic inspiration from drinking soma is recol lected but not repeated. 

There are strong associations between the drinking of soma, male viril ity, and female fecundity. Lanka pointed to the very first performance of  an agni-stoma by Prajapati, lord of creatures, in order to bring life into the  world. Several brief actions reinforce the procreative goals of yajna that mir ror those of the lunar isti. The veda grass brush (“Brahma’s moustache”) that  is featured in new- and full-moon rites appears again as a transient erotic  symbol, sometimes on the lap of the sacrificer, sometimes on his wife’s lap,  and at times even hurled across the arena by her after presentation by the  sacrificer. In her diksa mantra the wife requested offspring and later she is  associated several times with water and bathing, at one point sitting with  spread legs to pour water on her thighs in reference to her fertile womb  and child-bearing capacity. Still later in the agni-stoma she will carefully  bathe the sacrificial goat. And reference to the soma seat as a bed may be an  oblique disclosure of the locus of semen production, retas being a frequent  name for soma in the Rg Veda, replaced by ghee as another homology in the  Brahmanas and ritual sutras.34 

On the agni-stoma’s single pressing day (sutya) the drinking of soma,  soma-bhaksana, occurs morning, midday, and afternoon-evening. Each  pressing-offering-drinking event may be preceded by two other types of  offerings, the pravargya and upasad. The pravargya, not necessarily part of  agni-stoma, will be discussed at length below as it is a significant ritual in and  of itself. The upasad have a history in the cosmic struggles between the gods  and the Asuras, the gods eventually winning the day and becoming masters  of the universe by laying successive sieges (upasad) to enemy redoubts and  expelling Asuras from all three worlds. Immediately following discussion of  the pravargya AB 1.4.6 relates that scene and proceeds with applications to  ritual of these paradigmatic victories. In soma rites, however, upasad have  another meaning, not assaults but reverent approaches—with multiple liba tions of ghee for Agni, Soma, and Visnu.35A special moment occurs during  the third soma pressing (cf. ApSS 13.35.6) when the udgatr and his acolytes  cover their ears and chant the yajna-yajniya saman, a string of verses drawn  from the Rg Veda.

Becoming Agni 215 

An essential part of agni-stoma is this animal sacrifice, pasu-bandha, mean ing that the menu of this feast shared with the gods includes meat as well as  cereal grain loaves and a soma-juice beverage. Like the soma narrative, animal  sacrifice has an extensive genealogy in South Asia.36 If Asko Parpola is correct  in his interpretation of the Indus “fig-deity” seal from Mohenjo-Daro as the  sacrifice of a sarabha or markhor goat (Capra falconeri) to a goddess in a tree  (“a predecessor of Durga”), goat sacrifices in South Asia may be older than any  known Vedic ritual.37 

An animal sacrifice independent of soma rites is recommended for  an agni-hotrin in the month of Sravana (July–August) and is usually called  Sravana or nirudha pasu. Few if any, however, have done this prior to complet ing agni-stoma and only the rare Konasima pandit did it more than once after  yajna. Reticence on the part of a few to discuss personal ritual history may  stem from this disjuncture since Apastamba recommends that the nirudha  pasu be sacrificed once a year or even every six months (ApSS 7.28.6). All pan dits agree, however, on the absolute necessity of animal sacrifice within soma rites, including as many as thirty-two goats for a vaja-peya. In recent years the  pasu-bandha involving large numbers of animals has often meant postponing  the ritual until the final day and performing it within the guarded compound  of a sympathetic land owner in order to avoid disturbance by animal-rights  activists. 

The pasu-bandha permits coastal Andhrans to believe that they are the sole  remaining authentic Vedic sacrificers. Some in India and Nepal substitute  vegetable for animal offerings. When shown a copy of color plate 98A in Frits  Staal’s Agni, eleven banana-leaf packages of rice flour lined up in a row as  “animals” in the 1975 Nambudiri agni-cayana in Kerala, the Sriramapuram  ahitagni laughed and asked “How can there be a sacrifice if no one dies?” They  disdain the use of pista-pasu (flour-paste) figures of animals and continue to  offer soma and a real pasu together. 

On the pressing day of agni-stoma the Agni-Somiya male goat is dedicated  to Indra and Agni. In the samitra space in the northeast corner on Plan 6.1  he is smothered rather than beheaded, as in the oldest known Vedic animal  sacrifices,38 by a Kummari, a Potter of the Sudra artisan caste taking the role of  “pacifier” (samitr), one strong enough to hold a kicking goat. “It is the mantra  that subdues the sacrificial victim; the Kummari only assists,” say the Veda  pandits. They are in agreement with the general Hindu populace—villagers  who sacrifice thousands of goats to neighborhood goddesses—that a goat is  the closest correspondent to a human body. Two legs, four legs do not mat ter: his forelegs are always called “arms.” In ancient Rome Pliny the Elder,  who was never near India, thought the elephant was closest to a human; in216 vedic voices 

India, land of elephants, an affection for the goat won the nod. In the pat tern of Vedic correspondences, sacrificer and animal victim are one. Charles  Malamoud observes, however, that the sacrificer wishes both to offer and avoid  offering the animal; if their esoteric identity were total, the result would be the  death of the sacrificer.39 

Of the many segments of a goat’s body, eleven are selected as main offer ings, the heart (hrdiya) being singled out for special ritual attention. The  most important part of the animal, however, is the omentum (vapa), as in  TS 6.3.9.5, extracted as first offering. Today in the surrounding communi ties fierce goddesses demand blood and goats are “cut” in decapitation to  feed them. Asphyxiation in Vedic pasu-bandha, on the other hand, preserves  vital powers of breath within the animal; blood, left for demons and ghosts,  is never an offering to devata. Preliminary rites in the two traditions, how ever, are identical. The he-goat is pledged as offering, tied to a post (the yupa on Plan 6.1), sprinkled with water, calmed, and prevented from bleating. The  Vedic rite is apparently emotionally conflicted, more so than the neighbor hood goddess rite. Both the Vedic sacrificer and adhvaryu (standing inside the  square marked uttara vedi on Plan 6.1) turn away during immolation (as they  avert eyes when felling the tree for the yupa). 

Several mantras are muttered including TS 3.1.4.h insisting that the animal  go as a living gift to the gods, Agni and Soma in this case. The wife’s bath ing of the dead but still warm goat is said to cause his body to swell and be  strong, like the swelling soma stalks and wooden soma cups. Of this moment  Stephanie Jamison observes that the animal, like soma, is welcomed as a guest  in “a perverted hospitality ritual” and after its suffocation “the wife as progeni tor causes the dead animal to be reborn.”40 

The omentum is knifed loose and drawn out through a hole in the abdo men and this fatty membrane, precious to Indra, is stretched across his chest  by the adhvaryu as he struts and turns to every compass point for all to inspect,  a procedure pandits admit is not in Sutras but adopted for dramatic effect.  The yajamana touches this caul-like skein of flesh said to contain the essence  (medha) of sacrifice. As Ganesh Thite has observed, it is homologized to  semen and represents his immortality.41 The adhvaryu declares TS 1.3.9.2l “For  food!” It is a stunning moment reminiscent of the now rarely seen goddess  festival known in Telugu Godavari dialect as gavu featuring a dancing male  ritualist wearing a headless split goat, the patta potu, the special one of all the  animals “sealed” to the goddess, splayed open to reveal the viscera, including  the omentum. 

In the Vedic rite the omentum is held momentarily over the samitra fire  on a long fork where it flashes brightly before it is roasted on the ahavaniya as 

Becoming Agni 217 

first offering in the morning, something of an appetizer for the gods. Several  baked dough purodasa loaves for Indra and Agni accompany the goat in the  midday soma pressing and goat limbs, butchered in the morning and either  roasted or boiled in water or ghee in a pot, are offered at the third pressing of  soma in the evening. Animal flesh and plant juice have reserved equal space  on the banquet’s menu. 

As noted in Chapter 2, the parts of the animal are avadana, specific cuts  designated as main offerings. Bulusu Cayanulu enthusiastically labeled pan dits “surgeons” supervising the work of pristine double-edged knives wielded  by the Kummari. He enjoyed the selection process: heart, roasted separately  on a spit (sula) after slicing the omentum, tongue, liver, kidneys, lungs, breast,  left foreleg, and right hindquarter. Agni Svistakrt receives second-choice  cuts: right foreleg, left hindquarter, and a portion of the lower intestine. Telugu  sensitivity about words for genitals means reluctance to discuss the fate of the  penis and testicles although Apastamba (7.26.7) allots their remnants, after  the gods’ share, to the hotr, with the agnidhra and brahman respectively receiv 

ing leftovers of the lower intestines and breast. Even the tail, a phallic symbol,  has quite a complicated denouement toward several recipients including the  patni and the wives of the gods. The Kummari returns to receive the hide  and head. The latter, supremely desired by neighborhood goddesses, has both  mythic and ritual interest to Vedic gods but the pasu-bandha Sutra authors  generally pass it over. 

Duvvuri Yajulu was apathetic toward all of this, volunteering that he  never once performed nirudha pasu-bandha because the whole process  offended him, although for soma rites his consent was mandatory. Anasuya  called him squeamish, the contrary of her husband Lanka, who was as  much invigorated by the ritual as the bright-eyed Cayanulu. Kapilavayi  Venkatesvara admitted that the sight of an animal killed by the roadside  always saddens him while a sacrificed animal is totally different: that, he  said, is a sacred act. Duvvuri Yajulu agreed, but he enjoyed most anna-dana,  a gift of vegetarian food to the entire neighborhood. “When we performed  our yajna 76 full bags of rice were consumed in seven days. Konasima,  unlike Krishna District, is famous for generosity. Without anna-dana it is  not a real yajna.” 

At the close of agni-stoma, yokes, both real and symbolic, are removed from  the bullocks, soma carts, soma-pressing materials, wife (her yoktra), sacrificer  (his mekhala) and all ropes, cords, and hides are thrown in the river along with  all implements and containers that have been touched by soma. The gods,  priests, and sacrificer have consumed soma together and no trace may remain.  Although the wife does not drink soma her funeral will nevertheless require, 

218 vedic voices 

as discussed in the final segment of this chapter, that her bones and teeth  be re-cremated because she has absorbed the sacred substance by eating her  husband’s leftover food. The sacrificer and wife step into the river, now full of  the abandoned architecture of agni-stoma, and repeatedly pour pots of water  over each other until the unnetr priest leads them out. The sacrifice and its  protective diksa are concluded, they are born anew with new names (Soma-yaji  and Somi-devamma), and are now free to resume agni-hotra and entertain  thoughts of any advanced soma rite. 

### 8 The Pravargya 

A ritual sometimes inserted into the soma sacrifices between the diksa and the  three pressing days is the pravargya, basically an offering to the Asvins and  a few other deities of hot milk (cow’s and goat’s) plus ghee and curds. It is  often referenced as gharma, heat. Since it should be added during a second or  third soma sacrifice, not the soma-initiating agni-stoma for the couple, it has an  eccentric place in the sutras. The emphasis on heat brings to mind the cosmo 

gonic theme of tapas, heat, emergent from the dark primordial waters, as in  the famous late hymn of the Rg Veda, the nasadiya sukta, 10.129.3. In studied  preparation for the pravargya the sacrificer is supposed to encourage his inner  tapas. Both Tapas and Gharma are personalized as divine powers. The sun  (Savitr, Surya), source of light as well as heat, is thought to be strengthened by  this offering, just as in the two daily agni-hotra. 

A focus, however, on one implement of crucial import seems almost pre dictive of later devotional Hinduism. That object, known as Maha-vira, “great  hero,” is a three-tiered terra-cotta pot resembling a seated figure with head,  torso, and lower body. BSS has him created on the ritual ground from three  clay pinda, suggestive of funerary or ancestral symbolism in some early ver sion. ApSS 15.15.1 takes great pains to create a human effigy by careful place ment of sacrificial tools against the clay pot to represent all the bodily features  of Maha-vira: hair, ears, eyes, nose, mouth, right down to intestines, penis,  muscles, and nerves. For example, the veda munja-grass brush (“Brahma’s  moustache”) puts invisible hair on the unfired clay “head,” a black antelope  hide covers the pot with skin and body hair, curds and honey infuse blood,  crumbs of two baked purodasa loaves make nerves, and so forth. Such an effigy  calls to mind funerary texts, on one hand the cremation with sacrificial imple ments placed on the body (e.g. Baudhayana Pitrmedha Sutra 3.3),42 and on the  other hand the use of pratima or prati-rupa described in the construction of a  temporary “carry-over” body for the naked preta spirit after death.43

Becoming Agni 219 

The pot is briefly enthroned in the manner of the soma stalks before they  are pounded and then Maha-vira is anointed with ghee. Special wooden tongs  enfold and lift the molded three-leveled pot from the firing embers as the  sacrificer addresses it: “I encompass you with heaven and earth.” It is seated  on munja grass on a disk of silver as a gold piece covers it. Maha-vira, also  addressed as Gharma, is identified with the sun and called Prajapati, lord  of creatures, and other supreme titles. The head serves as bowl above a cen 

tral channel meant for the hot liquid offering to fill and then boil over “in all  directions” and flash in the fire. AB 4.1–5 is a brief passage on the pravargya homologizing this moment to creation, milk as semen overflowing from pri apic Maha-vira into Agni as birthplace of the gods. 

In addition to milk and ghee, libations also include dadhi-gharma, hot  curds. Two purodasa loaves are offered, the first to day, the second to night.  The rite must be completed before sunset and no person should bring the  sacrifice to a halt by casting a shadow on the pot. There is a BSS option for the  sacrificer to be sole drinker of remnants after the offering but ApSS has them  shared with the priests and Konasima aligns with the latter. 

The wife, normally with specified mantras and kriya in sacrifices, has  a limited role since the patni sala is screened from viewing preparation of  Maha-vira. At the prompting of the prati-prasthatr, however, she recites TA  4.7.19 and in the closing ceremony outside the sadas she sings a saman along  with the six priests involved, the basic three, hotr, adhvaryu, and brahman, plus  agnidhra, prati-prasthatr, and prastotr, the last singing from the Sama Veda so  that all four Vedas are present. When asked what happens to Maha-vira when  the sacrifice is concluded Konasima Brahmans were not of one mind, men tioning immersion in the river, abandonment on an island, and delivery to the  uttara-vedi as options. 

Hans van Buitenen understood the pravargya as a mystery rite focusing  on the central icon, Maha-vira, that he renders as “Large man.” His exegesis  uncovers not only a break with a Vedic aniconic tradition but also certain fea tures unusual in srauta ritual, including the use of a special fire just north of  the garha-patya, an implement of clay, not wood, made on the ritual ground,  and the worship of an anthropomorphic figure, quite unlike the use of a gold  man (purusa) in the agni-cayana. In his view the rite evolved from a simple  libation of hot milk and ghee to the Asvins in the time of the RV and AV to  the actual worship of the Maha-vira figure and incorporation into the soma 

schedule of six pravargya, morning and afternoon for three successive days,  the intention being to encourage the sun’s victorious emergence from the  rainy season. The pravargya serves as well as an illustration of ritual expansion  from simple to complex.44

### 9 The Soma-sacrifice Schedule and  

Other Rituals 

Vedic ritual texts imagine an ideal progression through a number of sacri fices—extensive and quite expensive—after the agni-stoma. In the modern  period there have been few ahitagni who managed more than the initial soma rite. A 1976 publication, Veda Pandits in India, volume 2, Andhra Veda Pandits,  listed 401 names with photos, including numerous ahitagni, but largely with out record of srauta careers.45 A valuable 1983 survey by C. G. Kashikar and  Asko Parpola is “Srauta traditions in recent times.”46 In the latter essay, the  Krishna and East Godavari Districts together accounted for well over half (114)  of the roughly 200 ahitagni listed historically for Andhra. It was at that time  estimated that only 120 ahitagni in all of India and Nepal had performed two  or more soma sacrifices, that is, agni-stoma plus any one of the other six varia tions in the list known as the sapta-samstha. Of these 120 more than half were  Andhra pandits, and Konasima was well represented, although there being  no available informant from the two Godavari districts not all were counted.  In the three decades since that tally the Godavari sum has fallen while the  Krishna number has risen markedly. 

Of the Konasima (East Godavari) ahitagni featured in this current study,  Duvvuri Yajulu, then age thirty-four, performed the sarva-prstha form of  agni-cayana in 1949 and the vyudha form of paundarika in 1969, thereby receiv ing his full name, Duvvuri Yajnesvara Paundarika Yajulu. Baballa performed  the aruna-ketuka in 1960. Mitranarayana was the sacrificer for agni-cayana,  sararvato-mukh, and ati-ratra, all in the 1960s. At the age of fifty-four Bulusu  Cayanulu performed his agni-cayana in 1969, the same year as Yajulu’s  paundarika, and thereby received his name. All four completed from one to  three sacrifices beyond agni-stoma. Lanka, Bulusu Kamesvara, and Pullela  Laksminarayana did not go beyond the first soma rite. 

There is one legendary regional history, however, and another that is accu mulating fame. The best known is Renducintala Yajulu, credited with com piling the most prolific srauta record in twentieth-century India and being a  major stimulus for Konasima, the place of his birth. Among his twenty-some  sacrifices were three paundarika, two vaja-peya, a sarvato-mukha, and seven  courses of the catur-masya. His ritual history is a litany all the pandits can and  do recite at every opportunity. He was a lifelong traveler, promoter of Veda and  srauta, and pursuer of ever-more exotic rituals to be done with his own fires.  After his passing an intriguing reflection was made by his wife, Laksmikanta,  at her home in Vijayawada:  “However playfully he may have felt about all  those rituals connected with fire, I know they were as challenging to him as 

Becoming Agni 221 

the taming of a tiger.” His descendants have now forged ahead with their own  performances. 

It is the Dendukuri family of Vijayawada that is racing to earn honors equal  to those of the Renducintalas by completing, even reduplicating the schedule,  vaja-peya, sarvato-mukha, aruna-ketuka, and all. It is the nature of Vedic rituals  to build interlocking systems, rituals within rituals, with mantras and kriya 

reappearing in different contexts. There is thus a tendency to solder together  bits and pieces of a ritual life that sometimes appears as a Brahmanic counter part to winning a page in the Guinness Book of Records, a frequent hobby of  

South Asians who grow the world’s longest fingernails or beards. There are several systems, by no means all in agreement, that classify fur ther the Vedic rituals under review here. One is by the number of soma-pressing  days, one day being an ekaha rite such as the agni-stoma with three pressings  on a single day. An ahina is the designation of a sacrifice with two to twelve  pressing days, although twelve-day rituals are also known as dvadasaha. A sac rifice lasting a year or more is a sattra. For example, the maha-vrata described  later is one day in the middle of a year-long sattra. A  sacrifice of Prajapati  goes to outer limits with a duration of a thousand years, at least according to  Apastamba (ApSS 23.14.11). 

The array of seven samstha mentioned in Chapter 2 is another classification  well known but not in mandatory order for observance after the initial one, the  agni-stoma. The six after agni-stoma include the vaja-peya, discussed later, as  well as atyagni-stoma, ukhthya, sodasin, ati-ratra, and aptoryama. Apastamba  briefly describes four soma sacrifices (ApSS 14.1–4) in which adjustments are  made in the pattern of agni-stoma by the addition of stotra for an animal sac 

rifice, distribution of soma cups, or in the case of the ati-ratra, the “overnight”  sacrifice, by extending the ritual late into the night. 

Yet a third ordering of rituals considers the material offerings themselves.  One of course is soma while another is havir-yajna, a list of seven to match the  seven soma sacrifices. These offerings are dairy products such as milk, ghee  (butter), and curds, grains such as rice, barley, and millet, and animals (today  the goat only, never the original bovines). Six of these rites have been covered  earlier under adhana, agni-hotra, darsa-purna-masa, pasu-bandha, catur-masya, 

and paka-yajna, the last simply being a category of “cooked” food such as rice  or barley. Still to be portrayed is a seventh havir-yajna, the sautramani offering  to Indra with the fermented beverage sura replaced today by milk. 

After the paradigmatic agni-stoma it is perhaps the agni-cayana, known  locally simply as cayana, that carries the most weight in coastal Andhra. Its  variations, extending as long as forty days in the paundarika, will now be  addressed.

6.10 Variations of Agni-cayana,  

Building a Fire Altar 

Baballa was delighted to see that his tortoise—the foundation “sacrifice”  for his aruna-ketuka recounted in Chapter 3—had escaped during the night  through the carefully crafted exit hole. He could then carry freely the pan of  embers that identified him with Agni and Prajapati, Fire and Lord of creation.  His venture was the construction of an imagined altar for Agni fashioned of  “water bricks,” ab-istaka. Duvvuri Yajulu also piled up sizable structures of a  thousand actual clay bricks, 200 in each of five layers, and then twenty years  later another with an additional thousand bricks. Both ahitagni knew they  were returning to the beginning of Time with a compilation of all the visible  and invisible parts of the universe. The water or clay bricks poured or laid  down one by one with creative mantras by the sacrificer, the adhvaryu, and  assistants are clouds, rivers, and grasses. They are bulls, asterisms, the new  moon, full moon, rsi sages, meters. Some of them are breath, creation, “life”  itself, “endless.” The coincidentia oppositorum of an altar of fire made of water  recalls the birth of Agni himself in the cosmic waters. 

At the heart of the edifice as it gradually rises are tangible items that  reveal the deep histories of arresting symbols, naturally perforated stones  (svayam-atrnna), for example, conical aerated turrets of marvelous castles built  by termites (valnika), and “space-fillers” (loka-parna), all of them declarations  of an interplay between the material and the immaterial, the world that is  manifest and the realm of the transcendent. As Mircea Eliade observed, “life  cannot be repaired, it can only be re-created by a return to sources.”47 And the  building of the altar is not merely a reconstitution of Agni, Prajapati, the uni verse in all its space and time, and the sacrificer who is identified with all of  them, but also a recovery of that which has never been revealed. It is some 

thing like the astronomer peering into space to see the universe not as it is but  as it was a hundred billion years ago. 

The various forms of agni-cayana in today’s Taittiriya tradition of Andhra  vary considerably from the well-known Nambudiri rite that occurred in Kerala  in 1975. The most striking difference is the dramatic horde of sacrificed ani mals, all of them goats. It is not quite the Roman-circus-like zoological spec tacle of an asva-medha, but the array of bleating stand-ins for the horse, bull,  ram, and others in the ancient version presents a bold contrast to the placid,  soundless row of vegetable packets in Kerala. 

Bricks assembled during the period of diksa for the yajamana and patni are carted to the construction site, a working crop field a with large trench  excavated so that later the completed altar can be covered over and returned

to production. The sacrificing couple may consult inherited copies of the  Apastamba or Baudhayana Sulba Sutras48 with various ground plans for altars  (citi) in order to choose a design for their platform. Authors of these sutras  possessed a spirited knowledge of geometry, sagely fitting kiln-fired bricks  into intricate patterns for each layer. Their artistry even takes a playful dimen 

sion in the case of feathered wing tips for a soaring eagle or the outstretched  legs of a tortoise who also appears to be flying to heaven! Mobility is again  suggested in the ratha-cakra citi, chariot-wheel altar, either with spoked or  solid wheels. In addition to the eagle that brings to mind the syena stealing  soma from heaven in Rg Veda 4.26 and 27 (cf. TS 5.5.3.2), other birds can be  constructed or the eagle may be stylized and built entirely of square bricks  in a T-form with neither head nor tail. Others are in drona (soma cup or tub  form), either circular or square, and still others are mandala, circular. Quite  popular, however, is the soaring eagle, like the one sketched from memory by  a Dendukuri grandson in Plan 6.2, the brahmacarin artist perhaps imagining  his own srauta sacrifice in the future. 

Construction demands a yardstick, supplied by a length of bamboo the  height of the sacrificer with upraised arms. In addition to clay bricks of vary ing dimensions there are preparations of foundation soil. The adhvaryu plows  the soil with one or more bullocks, waters it thoroughly, and sows seeds of  sesame, rice, barley, wheat, legumes, and several wild plants. As well as the

runaway tortoise two other reptiles are involved, a frog and a snake. A gold  coin and a small gold human image (hiranya-purusa) are foundational, as are  a naturally perforated stone, a divot of darbha grass, and a lotus leaf, all con sidered as “bricks” for the altar. 

Pandits adhere to ApSS 16.1–17.26 in the first act of the standard agni-cayana,  one that concerns the ukha fire-pot fashioned of clay, fired, cooled, filled with  embers, and carried about by the sacrificer identified with this glowing heart  of the altar under construction. It is symbolically bound (yoked) as are an ass,  a horse that imprints with his right front hoof the major source of clay, and  other featured elements of the sacrifice. The sacrificer visualizes, as he will  throughout these proceedings, his ritual rival, that special person he hates. 

The ukha is joined by a terra-cotta skull (substitute for the male Vaisya  or Rajanya decapitated head in the ancient rite) and a termite turret contain ing, like a human head, seven holes. These two “heads” become the center  of attention while verses are addressed to the Lord of the dead, Yama. They  represent fore offerings, as signaled by the passage of fire around them, and  there quickly follow the immolations of three goats impersonating the horse,  bull, and ram of the ancient schedule, as well as two more that become the  hornless goat and actual male goat (ApSS 16.7.1). Except for the clay dummy  and the termite turret it is no longer the original festival of heads as there are  no decapitations. Omenta are offered and purodasa loaves are baked on sherds  and given to Agni Vaisvanara, “common to all men.” The drama of the ukha 

fire-pan continues when the sacrificer raises it, takes the three Visnu strides  that encompass the universe, enthrones it (just he did with soma stalks), then  praises Agni who is kindled in it. 

Once the initial foundation is constructed, four bricks initiate the  new garha-patya hearth. Observers are instructed here with a significant  point: bricks are not created until there is heard the resounding mantra that  lays each in its place.49 Just as a goat is not killed by the Potter acting as samitr but rather by the mantra, so it is not the Potter who creates each brick but  a mantra. When Duvvuri Yajulu performed his first cayana it rose to knee  height (and in the telling of it he here recited TS.5.6.8.d and Apastamba).  His second one came up to his waist. Those who build a third attain the  height of the mouth. Since each performance adds a thousand bricks, succes 

sive cayana are described by the number of sahasra, thousands. For example,  Renducintala Yajulu performed several different paundarika forms of cayana,  with a dvi-sahasra (2,000-brick) altar followed by tri-sahasra (3,000-brick)  and catur-sahasra (4,000-brick) altars. Dendukuri Agnihotra performed his  prathama or first sahasra in 1991, dvi-sahasra and tri-sahasra in 1994, all in  Vijayawada.

Becoming Agni 225 

At the conclusion of the sacrifice the yajamana stands and praises the altar,  something he has done periodically throughout. More than a gesture, it is  his opportunity to reflect upon the meaning of his cosmogonic effort. In the  end the massive array of repeated correspondences in the agni-cayana—sacri 

ficer = Agni = Prajapati = the year = the three worlds—points beyond merely  gaining heaven toward that decisive statement of the Upanisads, ya evam veda,  “who knows this (set of correspondences)” gains release. And yet, as we dis 

cover later in this chapter, he does not imagine moksa is his reward. Popular as well as scholarly attention was drawn to the agni-cayana with  the publication in 1882 of five volumes of the fifty-volume series, The Sacred  Books of the East, these five being Julius Eggeling’s translation of the Satapatha  Brahmana with copious notes that remain incisive. Now, however, one turns  first to Frits Staal’s monumental two-volume project, Agni: The Vedic Ritual  of the Fire Altar (1983, reprint 2001) with the cooperation of more than two  dozen scholars and Kerala Veda pandits. Excellent color plates and diagrams  from the 1975 performance in Kerala, as well as the 1977 film “Altar of Fire”  provide unparalleled resources for the study of a single ritual. One of the few  defects of the book is the lack of documentation on the patni who is virtually  unmentioned. Of some 108 photographs of participants, the sacrificer’s wife  appears in only three, with head bowed under a parasol, suggesting she has  no role.50 

6.10.1 Paundarika 

The most complex, demanding, even exhausting version of agni-cayana is the  forty-day paundarika, considered the specialty of coastal Andhra, a rite featur ing garlands of white lotus flowers (paundarika). It is usually an ahina with  a core of eleven soma-pressing days in its vyudha form, by contrast with a  variant samudha form with twelve, thirteen, or more pressing days.51 There  are prominent srautin who have performed both types. In all the scores of  hours enjoyed in conversations with Duvvuri Yajulu the paundarika, one of  his add-on names, remained his favorite topic. Large-scale preparation is nec essary, as well as financial solvency since the recommended priestly fee (of  

course not observed today) is ten thousand cows (ApSS 22.24.8; KSS 23.1.9). The capsule biography of Kapilavayi Rama Sastra in Chapter 3 included a  narration of his uneasiness before his first udgatr role in a paundarika. This  was the first performance in the area of a 3,000-brick cayana in the vyudha form of paundarika. His anxiety softened after his deceased father appeared in  a dream to offer pertinent advice. Some of his stress may have been that his  older brother Venkatesvara was hotr, the adhvaryu was Renducintala Krishna,226 vedic voices 

son of Renducintala Venkatacala Yajulu, and his own son, Agnihotra, was  assuming his first rtvij role as prati-prasthatr among the seventeen priests. That particular paundarika began with twelve days of diksa and the sac rifice of a pure white goat for Vayu, the spotless goat having been procured  in Hyderabad after a considerable search. He was first in the list of seven teen goats, the number belonging to Prajapati just as in the vaja-peya sacri fice. Days 13 to 25 scheduled an array of preliminary rites, including prayaja,  fore-offerings involving Ida and other deities, the pravargya, and numerous  libations of ghee. The centerpiece and fulcrum of the paundarika, as bricks  were laid down in the manner described earlier, was eleven straight days of  soma pressing, offering, and partaking along with goat sacrifices, one each day  beginning on day 26 with the Agni-somiya goat. Ten of the goats were males,  the sole exception being a nanny dedicated to the goddess Sarasvati on day  30. The last goat to be smothered was given over to Varuna on day 36 with  its semen (virya, essence) extracted and offered as a homa into the ahavaniya. Day 37 was a break in the dissecting of pasus when a goat dedicated to  Tvastr was set free after circumambulation with the fire-pan. The final sub stantial sequence was a condensed version of the sautramani with milk substi tuting as usual for sura and a sacrifice to Indra of three goats at a single post,  two of them serving as stand-ins for the bull and ram in the sutras. This was  an overnight (ati-ratra) soma-pressing schedule on days 38 and 39. The long  and arduous sacrifice conclude on day 40 with an offering of hot milk ladled  onto cold curds before the final bath. 

6.10.2 Aruna-ketuka 

A quite different form of agni-cayana is the “water-brick” aruna-ketuka men tioned earlier in this chapter and in Chapter 3. It was a family tradition main tained by Baballa in August 1960 with Lanka as adhvaryu. At the ripe age of  fifty-seven he first did a twelve-day neighborhood begging tour, madhu-kara,  as if still a brahmacarin beginning his Veda career. He and Sundari observed  diksa for a full year before commencing. This imaginative cayana establishes  an “altar” of water, each ladle poured into his right palm and then into a clay  pot being placement by mantra of an ab-istaka, “water brick.” It is a perfect  extension of the correspondences or connections (nidana, bandhu) that allow  a brick to be a cloud, breath, or one of the meters. 

TS 5.2.10.1–13 is the clue in establishment of the first layer of bricks for a  standard cayana, with twenty apasya water bricks placed, five in each of in the  cardinal directions. They are productive seed that brings offspring, cattle, and  food. They also have prophylactic powers against demons and the dangers 

Becoming Agni 227 

of unbridled fire. ApSS 16.28.4 follows suit by including rain water and river  bricks (17.5.5; 7.1.1). The beauty of aruna-ketuka highlights the significance of  water in all the sacrifices enumerated thus far, rituals that begin with the  sprinkling of water, end with a bath in water, and entertain that essential ele 

ment unobtrusively but frequently in the course of procedures. In the asva-medha, to take one example, the horse sniffs water, both king  and horse (the royal alter-ego and victim-as-offering-to-the gods) are sprinkled  with water, a four-eyed dog is trampled by the horse in water, and at the con clusion a leper stands in water as an “altar” for a final offering. As much as any  element, water is ubiquitous and it is not surprising to find a crucial identity  regarding this cosmic foundation for Agni. Waters, either celestial or terres trial, are described as the birthplace and home of Agni. In RV 10.51 Agni hides  in the waters before he is discovered. 

This primordial search for Agni therefore is replicated in the collection  of different kinds of water to serve as bricks for aruna-ketuka. Baballa and  Sundari saved water from rain that fell on a day with a bright, clear sun; from  the nearby moving canal; from a standing pool; from the ocean (i.e., the Bay of  Bengal); and last, the easiest source, from a learned Brahman’s house, mean 

ing their own courtyard well. The bricks were laid in courses, mostly in groups  of one to eleven at a time, with appropriate mantras for Agni, Indra, Surya,  Visnu, and a host of other deities. The foundational tortoise (recalling Kurma  as source of the cosmos, its frontal plate, body, and carapace representing the  three levels of the universe), lotus leaf, and gold man and plate were done  according to the standard agni-cayana. Kurma, having found the escape tun 

nel, would live to plod along in the delta sun. 

Attributed to the sage Aruna, the aruna-ketuka is one of a group of altar  patterns ascribed to the Kathaka sakha. Five other altar constructions are  listed by Apastamba (ApSS 19.11–15):  savitra-cayana, according to Savitr  or Surya, the sun; naciketa-cayana, ascribed to another sage, Naciketas;  catur-hota-cayana, according to the RV formulas of the four hotr priests;  vaisva-srja-cayana, the altar founded by universal creators; and finally an altar  combining all of these styles. For his part Baudhayana (BSS 19.1–10) covers  the same set of Kathaka altars, albeit with brahma-cit as the name of the one  with multiple hotr. BSS 19.10 is the long segment followed by Baballa, one  that concludes with the key statement that one who achieves aruna-ketuka reaches brahma-loka, the world of Brahma, and there is rewarded by being  in the company of Brahma. 

Charles Malamoud has noted that rites for these special kinds of fire altars  are found in a segment of the Taittiriya Brahmana (10.1–10; 11.1–11; 12.1–9) with  one exception, the aruna-ketuka, saved for the opening lines of the Aranyaka.

His suggestion is that the fashioning of water bricks was such an enigma, a  paradox, that its proper locus for study and transmission was the forest.52 

6.10.3 Sarvato-mukha 

While the eleven soma-pressing days and forty overall days of paundarika make it the most extensive altar construction temporally, another variation of  agni-cayana expands both space and personnel. That is the sarvato-mukha, a  fire platform “facing all directions,” four joined altars facing north, west, and  south as well as east, the primary one of the cardinal directions. Such a prodi gious undertaking demands an astonishing seventy-two rtvij, a number that  consumes all available Telugu Veda pandits and still requires importation of  outsiders from Tamil Nadu and as far away as Varanasi. 

It is understandable that the rite is a rarity given the facts of ritual rivalry  and a fear of damage either intentional or accidental. When a number of out sider pandits failed to appear for a sarvato-mukha that Lanka observed, the  sacrifice was changed at the last moment into a paundarika requiring only  seventeen rtvij. Nevertheless, there is a boldness in continuing performance  and sarvato-mukha has been accomplished more than half a dozen times by  pandits mentioned in this study, including Mitranarayana, as discussed in his  capsule biography in Chapter 3. Renducintala Venkatacalu Yajulu was first in  the region and later his eldest son Renducintala Canandrasekhara Yajulu was  another in 1980 while Dendukuri Agnihotra was a recent sarvato-mukha per 

former in 1995. 

6.11 The Vaja-peya Drink of Strength 

The vaja-peya, “drink of strength,” summarized in brief in Chapter 2, is some times chosen in Andhra for a second soma sacrifice. Along with Agni, Prajapati  is the ever-conscious role model for a sacrificer. Prajapati’s sacred number is  the total or all-encompassing one of seventeen, one beyond the “complete”  number sixteen, and it is not surprising therefore to find Apastamba declar ing “the vaja-peya is all about seventeen.”53 Seventeen sastra and seventeen  stotra are heard, seventeen cups of pressed soma are drunk on the seventeenth  day by seventeen priests, seventeen animals are sacrificed, and in addition to  soma, seventeen cups of sura are imbibed by the priests. Sura, a distant cousin  to Japanese saki, was brewed from rice, barley, and millet left to ferment in  milk for three days. The opening diksa days and closing daksina are also sev enteen. The sacrificial pole (yupa) is seventeen arati in height. Seventeen bass 

Becoming Agni 229 

drums are boomed to urge on horses drawing seventeen chariots on a race  course measured at seventeen bow-shots to a goal post and back, a total dis tance that might be over two miles if the archer is given a decent bow. 

The horse is celebrated for his strength (vaja), the first term in the name  of the rite, and such power is acquired by the sacrifice. The horse-drawn war  chariot figures obliquely when a wheel with seventeen spokes is set up with its  hub on a short post. The wheel becomes a seat for the brahman priest when  he does the “chant of the horses” commanding the steeds to win heaven while  the adhvaryu revolves the wheel three times. All the horses had been bathed  and made to approve rice cooked in milk by smelling it. And . . . they’re off!  But no charioteer may round the turning post and return to the finish line  before the sacrificer. The horses smell the rice again, drums are unbound, and  immediately the sacrificer, having won an earthly victory, achieves heaven by  climbing a ladder braced against the sacrificial pole. The ladder of course has  seventeen rungs. Apastamba has him ascend alone after three exchanges of  verses with his wife whereas some sutras authorize her partial ascent; halfway  up the sacrificer announces “We have now become the children of Prajapati!”  At the top he declares “We have now both become immortal!” 

The cosmic symbolism of the race may be expressed in the circuit itself  with a turning post (kastha, similar to the Roman circus meta) as well as the  revolving chariot wheel-seat for the chanting brahman. Here Asko Parpola has  supplied several cogent insights into the vaja-peya: the turning post could be  construed as world pillar or axis mundi; one type of fire altar construction is  the ratha-cakra, chariot wheel; and the divine horsemen twins, the Asvin, may  be representatives of the routine chariot drives of the sun and the moon in day  and night, respectively.54 

Gold is featured many times, in gold chain necklaces for the priests, a  piece on which the sacrificer places his right foot, and in daksina. The sixteen  charioteers who completed the main event are given cups of sura (but not  soma) and they join in the feast of meat from the sacrificed animals, includ 

ing, in addition to the seventeen for Prajapati, a cow for the Maruts and a ram  and ewe for Sarasvat and Sarasvati, respectively. 

Thus the ancient program. Today’s vaja-peya is less spectacular, the  wooden-wheeled bullock-drawn ratha (chariot) “race” is not about to challenge  Ben Hur, and the sacrificer, his wife holding on to him, may keep one foot  on earth while he “climbs” to heaven with the other. It is also less stimulat 

ing as sura has become milk. Nevertheless, it is an authentic soma and pasu sacrifice (without cow or ram) with all the mantras and kriya and as many as  thirty-two goats in a recent one. Lanka supervised several, including two in his  home village of Nedunuru in 1975 and 1979. A charming photo of the former 

230 vedic voices 

vaja-peya shows him in a wooden-wheeled ratha surmounted by a parasol.  Mitranarayana was brahman singing the chant of the horses in the first one,  udgatr in the other, and Bulusu Kamesvara also took priestly roles. Dendukuri  Agnihotra performed vaja-peya, as his older brother, Candrasekhar, had done  previously. Dendukuri Agnihotra commenced on Telugu New Year’s Day,  Ugadi, March 20, 1996, only three months after he performed his gigantic  sarvato-mukha. 

Forty years earlier Hans van Buitenen filmed a vaja-peya with the last  ahitagni in Pune who still maintained three fires, Sri Bapat, who followed  Hiranyakesi Srauta Sutra. A  number of Sukla Yajurvedins were attendants  but not participants and a crowd estimated at 25,000 observed. The first day  took place in the agni-hotra room, the second on the prag-vamsa, third on the  maha-vedi, the space being a sports field of S. P. College. The soma was pressed  and drunk, a goat was tied to the sacrificial pole but never sacrificed. Again the  Andhra pandits, when told of this event, considered it an inappropriate and  incomplete yajna if no animal was offered and shared. As in ancient versions,  a modern sacrificer concludes with a verse addressed to Brhaspati, the god  who aided him in winning the chariot race.55 

6.12 The Maha-vrata Great Vow and  

Go-sava Bull Imitation 

The great majority of rituals covered in this chapter are solemn affairs, every one striving to avoid errors, the alert brahman paying as close attention as  possible to every syllable and action, the adhvaryu and crew moving rapidly  from point to point, outside onlookers observing restraint. Joy, exuberance,  vivacity are not common expressions, with the possible exception of pleasure  during an agrayana. At its height, however, one ritual evokes a festive response  with musical instruments, singing, dance, and transgressive performance  arts. That occasion is the maha-vrata, “great vow,” in the middle of a sacrificial  session (sattra) known as the gavam-ayana, “path of the cows.” According to  the sutras the one-day festival is preceded and succeeded by 180 days of the  sattra in which priests take multiple roles in pressing soma, offering a goat to  Prajapati (or Surya), and building the fire altar. Shorter versions of sattra from  a fortnight to forty-nine days are possible, and of course the other extreme is  also presented, including a sattra lasting a hundred years.56 

The maha-vrata is the keystone of the sattra described in ApSS 21.15–25.  No Konasima pandit living today has performed it but some have participated  in one by invitation. Each priest has a place and functions often unique in his 

Becoming Agni 231 

experience. The adhvaryu sits on a wooden bench, the udgatr on a high chair  of udumbara wood, and the hotr on a swing-seat suspended like a glider from  a cross bar, a type of seat seen in affluent Andhra homes today. An accom plished person using a bamboo pluck plays an extraordinary vina, a lute with  ten holes, each with ten munja strings. Wives sit on distributed grasses and  occasionally sing, play flutes, or blow on conches, while girls sing and perform  dances that one might imagine to be ancient precursors of classical Kuchipudi.  Four “earth drums” are constructed of hides drawn over pits in the ground.  They have the wonderfully onomatopoeic name bhumi-dundubhi. Chariots roll  onto the maha-vedi and archers shoot arrows into rawhide targets. Martial arts  in ritualized combat take place, similar to nocturnal street pageants among  non-Brahmans today, although the Vedic version features a match between  Sudras and Brahmans under showers of abusive phrases not otherwise heard.  In other words, it is a celebratory occasion for transgressive release. 

Erotic display is not omitted. Behind a screen on the maha-vedi a man  “from Magadha” has intercourse with one prostitute (pumscali) while a Vedic  student under a vow of celibacy engages in a ribald dialogue, reminiscent of  asva-medha exchanges, with another. Some sutras are far more explicit here  than Apastamba. The maha-vrata has elicited response from pandits as well  as scholarly commentators, the former back-pedalling away from what they  see as licentious elements, the latter pointing to those same aspects as well  known in the history of religions for promoting fecundity in earth, animals,  and humans. Many have seen swinging and a tug of war over a rawhide fac simile of the sun as annual solar rituals. Asko Parpola’s suggestive analysis,  uncovering deeper layers of the pre-classical Vedic religion, sees the goddess  Vac (=Durga) as the central deity in the maha-vrata and he understands the  bhumi-dundubhi as war drums in keeping with the archers, ritualized combat,  and fiercer aspects of the goddess.57 

Long ago Renducintala Yajulu performed a maha-vrata in Gungalakurru,  on the canal just south of Nedunuru, employing a vesya (Telugu: prostitute) and  a Brahman bachelor in lieu of a brahmacarin for the sexual act, and Dendukuri  Agnihotra has more recently added the rite to his impressive resume. Duvvuri  Yajulu, performer of a paundarika in 1969, knew that the maha-vrata, with  requisite prostitute, was to be performed on the next-to-last day. “A couple was  available in Guntur,” he said, Guntur being “Magadha,” far away where things  are done improperly, “but I  did not seek them. No one would watch them  perform, so who could verify that ‘it’ was actually done! So with darbha grass  we made a male and a female doll (bomma) and threw them both up on the  platform out of sight!” On another occasion he suggested that “it” might have 

232 vedic voices 

entered the ritual to remind the sacrificer and wife, celibate for forty days in a  paundarika, how “it” is done! 

There appears to be no limit to Vedic ritualists’ imagination regard ing the voluptuous interplay of human, animal, and plant kingdoms, what  Dylan Thomas called “the force through which the green fuse drives the  flower.” In a later segment of this chapter the asva-medha is explored,  an extensive rite in which the king-sacrificer is homologized to a living  stallion, both remaining celibate for one year. The queen ritually accepts  into her body the pent-up sexual forces of productivity from the sacrificed  horse-king. In another ritual, the go-sava, the sacrificer, not a royal one, is  homologized to a bull, and in direct opposition to the king-horse, enjoys  the freedom to mount anything that moves. In fact, this libertarian venture  grants license to incest, transgression of a nearly universal taboo. Behaving  bull-like, for one year the sacrificer should mount his own mother, sister,  and (directly countering marriage rules) a woman from his own gotra. Also  bull-like, he should be free to urinate and defecate anywhere and anytime  he chooses. 

Apastamba (ApSS 22.12.17–20; 13.1–3) and Baudhayana (BSS 18.7) rely on  TB 2.7.6.1–3 but come up with quite different details on this one-pressing-day  ukthya type of soma sacrifice that admits the sacrificer to svarga, heaven, and  requires a daksina of 10,000 cows. Baudhayana omits transgressive acts and  any mention of bulls or cows other than the daksina. There is understand 

able reluctance on the part of pandits following Apastamba to discuss what  is seen as outrageous behavior. Age-old musings on human-bovine rapport  carry no weight. Outside the Taittiriya sakha, however, there is one amus ing tale to inject a note of levity. The Jaiminiya Brahmana (JB 1.113) includes  the experience of an old man who performed the go-sava, in the course  of which, in a crowd of people, he lost control of his bladder. This comes  naturally to bulls so he pronounced the go-sava to be properly an old man’s  ritual, a sthavira yajna. Perhaps the narrative also defuses sexual transgres sions (with troubling echoes of the sins of Prajapati with his daughter and  Yama with his sister) as no more than the empty gestures of an old bull put  out to pasture.58 

6.13 The Sautramani Offering to Indra  

the Protector 

An addendum to the now discontinued raja-suya, or the vaja-peya or the  agni-cayana, including the paundarika, is a four-day soma, sura, and animal 

Becoming Agni 233 

sacrifice known as the sautramani, addressed to Indra Sutraman, the king  of the gods as protector. Actually, the deities are threefold and a ram was  once sacrificed to Sarasvati and a goat for the Asvin twins along with a bull  to Indra. Today the offerings are all goats, a female going to the goddess.  Sarasvati and the divine twins are known for their healing powers and the  trio figures in the origin myth of the rite. More than any other god, Indra is  famed as soma-pa, drinker of soma. He had an early start as is mother served  him the sacred juice as a newborn baby (RV 3.48.2–3). But at one time an  over-indulged Indra had what could be described as a bad trip: he came com pletely undone and lost his vital powers, including the splendor and fiery  energy that enabled him to rise above all other gods. The curative ritual,  offerings to Indra of more soma, sounds like a “hair of the dog that bit you”  remedy. It worked, apparently due to sura, Indra became his powerful self  again, and the sautramani has been recommended ever after for Brahmans  unable to hold their soma. Apastamba and other sutra writers repeatedly  address this matter of the sacrificer or priest who vomits soma and is in need  of special attention.59 

There are two versions of the rite and coastal Andhrans follow that of  Kakali rather than Caraka. The sura fermented grain concoction of the  vaja-peya appears again in the sautramani with special cups for the deities  in addition to soma cups. Eagle feathers are involved, perhaps a reminder of  the eagle that first brought soma from heaven. A wilder sura recipe occurs  in the Caraka version where the hairs of a lion, leopard, and wolf are placed  in the deities’ cups. A  way to avoid these dangerous predators, however,  is simply for the sacrificer and two priests to visualize them. Kane has an  observation here: “The prowess, impetuosity, and fury found in those wild  beasts” is the symbolic point. 

Once again in today’s performance the sacrificer and priests drink milk  as substitute although a goat-hair sieve is employed as if this “sura” required  purification by straining in the fashion of soma production. The sacrificer  offers a sura cup to Indra while the adhvaryu and prati-prasthatr present cups  to the Asvins and Sarasvati, respectively. (The prati-prasthatr for this sautra 

mani, incidentally, was Kapilavayi Rama Sastri’s son, Agnihotra, enjoying his  first rtvij role). After the initial omenta are removed, the three animals are dis sected, cooked, and offered with purodasa. The hoof and vestigial “hoof” of one  goat are covered with fat scooped from the surface of the cooking water and  offered into the ahavaniya, all the sura cups are dumped in the water meant  for the concluding bath of sacrificer and wife, daksina are distributed, and the  sautramani is concluded.60

6.14 The Asva-medha, Sacrifice of the Royal  Horse, the Purusa-medha, and the Raja-suya 

Of all the Vedic rituals surveyed here it is perhaps only the agni-cayana that  has drawn as much attention from scholars outside of India as the horse  sacrifice. This is due in part to the huge spectacle of the year-long rite with  its cast of many hundreds, an Indic Noah’s ark collection of wild and domes 

tic animals (as many as 636 in one account), and the cachet of a handsome  stallion wandering free to seek new pastures and conquer new territory for  the king in the bargain. Mostly, however, its notoriety west of India is gained  from apparent Indo-European roots and knowledge of counterparts in the  Roman October horse, ancient Scandinavian myths and rites, and Celtic and  Greek mare sacrifices. Jaan Puhvel notes that the asva-medha represents “the  sum of Ancient Indic pageantry” and Wendy Doniger, an ardent lover of  horses, observes in the introduction to her translations of Rg Vedic hymns  about the asva-medha (1.162 and 163):  the horse is three things at once, a  material creature, a race horse, and “a precious sacrificial victim.”61 

As noted previously, the asva-medha is the favorite ritual of Kapilavayi  Rama Sastra although he knows he can never see or participate in one, the  last performance being some three centuries ago. Its mantras and kriya, how ever, are alive in his imagination. And most pandits are familiar—although  it is not in the Taittiriya syllabus—with the wondrous opening lines of the  Brhadaranyaka Upansad in which all parts of the sacrificial horse are linked  to cosmic space and time, even his neigh being speech. Sanskrit epics and  Puranas occasion numerous performances of the horse sacrifice and Chapter  1 noted that several rulers of Andhra dynasties celebrated asva-medha to mark  successful wars, expanded kingdoms, and their new roles as cakra-vartin, uni 

versal sovereigns. One of the last recorded performances was that of the raja of Amber, Savai Jayasing, early in the eighteenth century ce. Rama Sastra’s acquaintance with the horse sacrifice began in his first two  years of sitting with his father to hear mantras from kanda 3 and 4 of the  Taittiriya Samhita. These mantras about the sacred horse were put in per spective when he later came to the Taittiriya brahmana portion. Finally, when  he neared the end of his brahmacarin years, he learned the full program of  the drama in ApSS 20.1–23. Other than BAU 1.1 he is not acquainted with  the Vajasaneyi mantras and the Satapatha Brahmana version that have been  major sources for many scholars. 

In his mind’s eyes and ears Rama Sastra sees and hears the scenes develop  from the selection of an outstanding stallion, often white but not necessar ily so, to the king whispering to the horse’s right ear the appellations of a 

Becoming Agni 235 

champion, then on to the release of the royal horse for a year of wandering in  the company of a hundred warriors, perhaps even 400 including 300 chari oteers. Although the king remains at home he turns over rulership to the adh varyu who is acknowledged as putative king as well as executive priest making  daily ghee libations into a footprint of the absent horse. The sacrificer-king lis tens as the hotr recites and lute players accompany singers recounting famous  exploits by kings past and present. These evening narrations will continue for  a full year of pari-plava cycles changing every ten days. After almost a year the  horse is guided home to his stable, provided that no defending army has killed  or captured him. 

Soma pressings and various animal sacrifices accompany the building of  the maha-vedi, great altar. The four major priests symbolically receive not only  the four quarters of space but also the four queens in hierarchical order, the  chief queen (mahisi) going to the supervising brahman, the favorite (vavata)  to the hotr, the displaced one (parivrkti) to the udgatr, and the message-bearer  wife (palagali) to the adhvaryu. The wives of the gods are addressed and a host  of the adhvaryu assistants distribute food to gathered observers throughout  the night. 

The second of three pressing days is the main event. The victorious horse  and two other animals are dedicated to Prajapati. A hornless goat is to go as  pathfinder-announcer to the gods, as in RV 1.162.4, and a gayal (gomrga, bos  frontalis) is given a role in special offerings. Then a vast crowd of other animals  is driven or carted in for dedication to a variety of deities, some creatures tied  to different parts of the starring horse that is bound to the central sacrificial  pole. In a single row ten poles flank each side of the median post and animals  are bound to each. TS 5.6.11–20 enumerates 180 animals tied to these twenty  flanking poles. Captive wild animals, including a boar and various birds, are  stationed between thee poles as scores of goats of every description bleat anx iously in the midst of all the unruly creatures straining at cords on the dusty,  dung-strewn arena of sacrifice. 

Three of the wives, each with a hundred female assistants, come forward  according to rank to wash the horse and string gold, silver, or pearl beads into  his mane, tail, and other hairy parts and smear him with ghee. The adhvaryu hitches the stallion with flanking horses to the royal chariot, the king-sacrificer  equips himself with armor and bow and mounts it while expressing reverence  to his ancestors and respect to the horses, chariot, and charioteer. The horse  sniffs water and is released, then drinks water. The agnidhra brings Agni in  a pan, circles first the horse, then all the wild creatures so the latter can be  freed along with four selected mares and goats. The arena becomes markedly  calmer with only domestic victims still bound.236 vedic voices 

The climax of the ritual year comes with the immolation of the stallion,  hornless goat, and gayal, all by asphyxiation, the horse smothered with a blan ket, the other two strangled by cords. The prastotr sings a saman for the ears  of Yama and the prati-prasthatr brings the queens to the dying horse to circle  him nine times while fanning him, moving clockwise or counterclockwise  with their hair braided or flowing loose, slapping right or left thighs, chang ing these gestures as they alternate directions. As the lesser queens sit close  by, the chief queen lies down and entwines her legs with the stallion as the  adhvaryu guides the massive penis against her vagina. It is a graphic evoca tion of channeling the pent-up sexual powers of the king-horse toward the  sought-for birth of a new king. Although the horse wandered freely, care was  taken to prevent mares from attracting his attention, and simultaneously the  king observed chastity for that year while sleeping in the arms of his favorite  wife. Erotic forces are also aroused by juicy exchanges between priests and the  king’s wives who were earlier granted to them, dialogues of a sort that would  never occur in life outside the protective canopy of consecrated ritual space  and time.62 

The three queens, again according to rank, stitch the horse with gold, sil ver, and copper or lead needles to mark butchering lines, then do the same on  the hornless goat and gomrga before the extraction of omenta. It is said that  a horse has no vapa (omentum) so a layer of belly fat is stripped in its place.  The king-sacrificer cuts off the right ear of the horse, the one into which he  earlier whispered eulogies. Omenta are cooked and apportioned as the many  victims are dismembered, the blood and right front hoof of the horse being  set aside for cooking and then svistakrt sacrifice into the throat of the gayal.  The king-sacrificer ascends his throne to sit on a lion or tiger skin where he is  sprinkled repeatedly with water as the Purusa sukta is recited. 

Then comes a striking ritual that has the ring of ancient Central Asian  horse sacrifices, perhaps even Paleolithic ancestry. The adhvaryu takes the dis membered parts of the three chief victims and assembles them on the ground  as if they were alive, the head of the pathfinder goat facing west, the other two  heads facing east. All are then gathered up and offered into the ahavaniya. The  adhvaryu makes three additional offerings into the gayal’s throat, on the right  front hoof of the horse, and into an iron bowl. Animal sacrifices continue, as  they have throughout the ritual. 

The asva-medha opened with a curious ritual involving a “four-eyed” dog. It  now closes with an equally odd offering on to the bald head of a buck-toothed,  yellow-eyed leper from the lineage of Atri. Both rites involve pools of water,  the featured horse made to trample the dog in water, the leper made to stand  in water. Throughout the ritual water has sprinkled both horse and king and 

Becoming Agni 237 

again water is the medium for the concluding bath for the king-sacrificer and  presumably one or more of his queens.63 

Konasima pandits are as uncomfortable parsing the purusa-medha,  human sacrifice, as were some ancient commentators. Apastamba pro vides only seventeen phrases immediately following the horse sacrifice.  Accounts closely follow the asva-medha schedule, including an extraor dinary number of human victims and selection of a primary man who,  like the stallion, is granted a year of privileges while remaining chaste  until his asphyxiation and copulation with the chief queen. There is no  inscriptional or other record that a purusa-medha was ever performed,  leading some scholars to suggest it was simply invented to round out  sacrificial possibilities. And yet there it is in the list of requisite sacri fices. The Vajasaneyi Samhita—Satapatha Brahmana—Katyayana Srauta  Sutra sequence of White Yajur Veda texts contains the most details, 184  human victims in the SB account, 158 in KSS, all of them bound to sac rificial posts, then circumambulated by fire. Parallel to the asva-medha a  host of wild animals is released. The significance of the entire enterprise  is compromised when SB 13.6.2 presents a deus ex machina, an ethe real voice that intervenes to halt the proceedings: a sacrificer always eats  the victim, man would therefore eat man, not an acceptable act, ergo, no  performance.64 

The raja-suya, consecration of a king, died out like the asva-medha.  Although of considerable interest to scholars it draws scant attention from  the pandits and will be passed with brief mention here. It is treated in the  Taittiriya corpus including ApSS 18.8–25.22. Featured in addition to soma 

pressing and drinking are several king-as-warrior pursuits, a chariot drive, the  king shooting arrows from his bow, and a brief cattle “raid.” There is a recita tion of the tale of Sunahsepa, the boy who was nearly sacrificed to Varuna on  behalf of the sonless king Hariscandra. Also included is a game of throwing  dice by which the king is reborn and enthroned and the cosmos is regener ated. In his thorough monograph on the raja-suya Jan Heesterman concluded  by noting that the presiding deity of the ritual is the king, identified with the  cosmos and its processes.65 

6.15 Final Absorption into Agni:   

Funeral Rites 

In the Harappan civilization of the third and second millennia bce, successive  funeral traditions included burial in the ground, then cremation, and then urn  burials of the ashes from cremation. So too the Rg Veda included hymns for 

238 vedic voices 

ritual burials as well as cremations. Ultimately, however, Agni prevailed for  normative funerals. Henceforth it was Agni Kravyad, eater of flesh, who was  invoked rather than Bhumi, the gracious and mothering earth goddess who  still today safeguards the departed in many non-Brahman communities. 

Virtually every human has the desire to live a long life, postpone death, and  hear about concepts of fate and an afterlife hallowed by long tradition. Such  yearning has been resonant throughout this chapter, every ritual reflecting  some aspect of personal end time. The recruitment of ancestors in proceed 

ings is also essential since they form a community everyone will someday join.  A review of the rituals in the order described here may be instructive. When Agni is established in his fivefold and threefold representations  the daksina southern fire is in the quarter of death and attention to ancestors  and its embers will be employed in pitr-yajna, offerings to the Fathers. The  twice-daily sandhya-vamdana is a moment for a brahmacarin or an ahitagni to  declare his place in an ancestral lineage. For the ahitagni it is accompanied  by an evening or morning agni-hotra that includes mantras recognizing these  Fathers now in the company of the Vasus, Rudras, and Adityas, the celestial  generations to which pitr-yajna go, along with the more remote and general ized ancestors with the Visvedevas, All-gods. 

The lunar isti include some of the same mantras and by long tradition  new-moon day, more than full-moon day, is a special occasion for providing  satisfaction to ancestors. As for the agrayana, the perpetuation of nutritive life  is celebrated in the first-fruit offerings of new rice, barley, and millet. Some  families also offer seeds of bamboo, vamsa, a word that means lineage as well,  the tall measured stalk expressing a line of descent. The seasonal offerings, the  third (saka-medhas) in particular, involve the surpa winnowing fan, a funereal  emblem, offerings into the southern fire, discreet offerings to Pusan, path finder to the other world, and a link into pitr-yajna. It was suggested earlier  that one reason for laxity in performance of the threefold catur-masya could in  fact be such preoccupation with Mrtyu, lord of the dead, the maxim “let sleep 

ing dogs lie” coming to mind. 

In addition to fashioning three maha-vira “great hero” or “large man” pots  for the remarkably iconic pravargya ritual, a human effigy is created complete  with symbolic body parts. Ritual implements are placed, as if predictive of  what will happen later in last rites: first comes adornment of the deceased’s  body with all the paraphernalia of ritual life and then a temporary transitional  body is fashioned for the preta, transient spirit of the deceased. 

Turning to the first soma sacrifice, the requisite diksa is a symbolic death  and rebirth for both sacrificer and wife. The agni-stoma will include as well an  actual victim, the goat, going to the gods as a “living” gift. His omentum (vapa) 

Becoming Agni 239 

representing the immortality of the sacrificer will be the first offering to the  deities before it is cooked and shared in what amounts to the goat’s funerary  banquet. The Sravana-pasu independent goat sacrifice is also a real rite of pas sage, again involving identification of the sacrificer with that animal closest to  a human, now transported from this world to the other. 

As for the additional soma sacrifices, the construction of the fire altar in  agni-cayana or any of its variations is predictive of funeral observances for an  ahitagni or his wife, whoever dies first. The smasana citi or losta citi is the con struction of an altar on the site of the funeral pyre that consumed all the ritual  implements employed by the couple throughout years of agni-hotra and other  sacrifices. In smaller compass it is a recapitulation of cayana. With successful  conclusion of the vaja-peya “drink of strength” sacrifice it may be recalled that  the sacrificer and wife symbolically climb a ladder to svarga, heaven or the sun,  as he proclaims: “We have now both become immortal!” 

The maha-vrata, despite episodes of merriment and the arousing of pow ers of fertility, also has animal sacrifices. In the full course of a sattra goats  are everywhere stand-ins for the bulls, cows, calves, and ewes specified in the  sutras. And finally, to complete this review of rituals in this chapter, the sautra mani that parallels the independent goat sacrifice and includes such immola tion, contains an offering of “sura” (i.e., milk) onto a termite mound with its  folkloric connections to the other world, and ends with sacrifice to the ances tors. A rite intending to fortify the body of a one who cannot tolerate soma, the  sautrmani concerns a sacrificer who could be denied the attainment of heaven  without benefit of the sacred beverage. 

Apart from all these details in the full array of rituals, there are spe cial sutras known as pitr-medha that cover funerals for ahitagni (as well as  single-fire sacrificers and those who have not set fires). Just as manuals for  the final samskara, antyesti, are written by hand or published separately from  other life-cycle rites, so the touchy subject of ancestors, meaning the dead,  is covered by texts uncoupled from both srauta and grhya sutras.66 They are  largely unknown to Brahmans except for the special class of Apara Brahmans  and ahitagni who must consult books to perform last rites for one of their own  tiny circle. 

Chapter 3 noted the deaths of numerous ahitagni and patni, and some  funeral procedures for Baballa, Cayanulu, and Surya were detailed. Three  significant features were mentioned there and these require further elabora tion. First is the fact that an ahitagni, alone among all Hindus, does not die  until the beginning of the special funeral Taittiriyins know as brahma-medha.  A  second matter pertains to a soma sacrificer, and therefore drinker, who  must receive punar-dahana, a re-cremation of pulverized bones and teeth in 

240 vedic voices 

order to eliminate all traces of the sacred substance, and this rule extends to  his co-sacrificer wife. And third, an ahitagni who has performed any type of  agni-cayana fire-altar building is entitled to the rite of losta-citi (or losta-cayana),  construction of an altar of mud or sod bricks on the spot of the cremation pyre.  Perhaps the best way to illustrate these different funerary procedures is to  relate events in a single agrahara. 

Samavedam lived most of his life in the Sriramapuram agrahara as a suc cessful Veda pandit, one who did not choose to establish sacrificial fires and  perform agni-hotra. After his abrupt departure from this life he was soon  shaved, washed, and garlanded at home and carried to the burning mound  just fifty yards from the hamlet, a site never referred to as smasana but simply  “there” or “that place.” Although a short journey, the bamboo bier was set on  the ground for the requisite three stops, each for three circumambulations by  mourners before reaching a prepared pyre. The wood was ignited by embers  from the Samavedam household’s aupasana fire. An Apara Brahman, a priest  who specializes in obsequies for Brahmans, came from Amalapuram to super 

vise the ceremonies. Venkatarama Ghanapathi and Bhaskara Ghanapathi,  Samavedam’s two Veda pandit sons, participated and were then tasked with  the masika, monthly observances, including astaka, offerings on “the eighth”  day of the new moon, continued on the following day, as well as the anniver 

sary ritual (Telugu abdika) occurring a year later. 

Samavedam’s next-door neighbors, however, included three ahitagni, Baballa, Cayanulu, and Duvvuri Yajulu, whose respective funerals required  the extended procedures of Taittiriya tradition. Akondi Suryanarayana, the  same Apara Brahman, attended but could not direct; other ahitagni took over,  consulting books with special mantras and kriya for which Akondi was not  qualified. These three ahitagni required different procedures. Baballa was  stretched out on blocks of ice placed in his agni-hotra room, awaiting the  arrival from Pune of his student Ramam (Chirravuri Srirama Sarma) to assist  in the ceremonies at Baballa’s request. In their guru-sisya relationship Ramam  was a surrogate son, Baballa’s own disabled son a dying cancer patient at this  point. Cayanulu was laid face up across the vedi between his hearths as if he  were one more implement in sacrifice. And indeed his body was the sacrifice,  antyesti, the last isti to be performed before the clay hearths were scraped away. 

In both situations there was no death until the brahma-medha started.  Twice each day their bodies were washed, as if they were still bathing, and  fires were aroused, as if they were still doing agni-hotra evening and morn ing. Colleagues did mantras and kriya, including isti and prayascitta expia tions. The breathless bodies lying so close to the fires seemed to be cooking,  slowly melding with Agni, interiorizing him even before final absorption on 

Becoming Agni 241 

the cremation pyre. The significance of an ahitagni, about to travel, mystically  drawing the fires up into his body for safekeeping, is realized: a journey to the  other world is imminent. 

On the third day the bodies of Baballa and Cayanulu were carried to the  same smasana mound used years later for Samavedam, their processions to  respective pyres leaving about 8 am for rituals lasting almost until sundown.  Mourners carried three terra-cotta pots on slings labeled “a,” “d,” and “g,”  one for each of the three fires brought from the agni-hotra rooms. A fourth  pot behind carried coals from the aupasana fire to be maintained separately.  Ritual implements brought from the agni-hotra room were smeared with  ghee and placed on each body after it was laid across the wood, the havani ladle for agni-hotra on the mouth, upabhrt ladle in the left hand, wooden  knife (sphya) under the back, winnowing baskets (surpa) at the sides, wooden  yoke-pin (samya) on the genitals, metal pots for agni-hotra milk and ghee at  the feet. 

Embers from the ahavaniya ignited straw at the head, daksina-agni and garha-patya igniting torso and right thigh, respectively. Only the arani fire-churning woods, the juhu ladle, and ukhala and musala mortar and pestle  were withheld from the flames, these five to be used for secondary cremation.  The microcosmic layout of the body—head, torso, feet—is recognized in the  ritual as the body is returned via Agni to Purusa-Prajapati, the macrocosm  embracing heaven, midspace, and earth. 

Women are sometimes gatherers of charred bone and tooth fragments a  day or two later, dropping them one at a time into a pot without looking at it.  This important task is succeeded by the rite of punar-dahana, re-burning of  these fragments after they have been ground into chalky powder in the mortar  and pestle, then stirred with ghee into a paste. The juhu ladle serves to offer  the mixture, including the last traces of twice-burned soma, into a separate fire  maintained with embers from the initial cremation. 

After brahma-medha and re-cremation the procedures for Baballa and  Cayanulu differed only slightly in mantra and kriya. As performers of two  different versions of agni-cayana both were entitled to losta-citi, the stacking  of small sod or earth (losta) blocks in layers to commemorate their fire-altar  building. The blocks are called bricks (istaka) even though unfired, and at  times small stones may suffice. Baballa had performed aruna-ketuka with  water bricks while Cayanulu (as his honorary name reveals) had done cayana in a more conventional style nine years later. After thorough sweeping and  washing, the spot of cremation became the site of the memorial citi, one that  in both cases soon crumbled and disappeared in the rainy season. Ashes to  ashes, dust to dust.

With the losses of Baballa and Cayanulu, Sundari Somidevamma and  Subbalaksmi Somidevamma were left as white-covered widows confined to  their houses. Duvvuri Yajul’s wife Surya Somidevamma, on the other hand,  died suddenly nine years before him and her last rites had to meet three  requirements not faced by the other somi-devamma. First, because Surya’s  death left Yajulu alive the musi-vayanam ritual had to be performed for the  auspicious wife who dies first. A  brahma-muttaiduva Brahman funerary  priestess was brought from Amalapuram to locate Surya’s spirit and send it to  Gauri-loka, the heaven of goddess Gauri. Ten flower-adorned women attended  this female-directed ritual by the canal close to Sriramapuram and each  received Surya’s blessing in the form of prasada to take home. This is the ritual  that was done for Cayanulu’s first wife, Rama Suryakanta, when she died of  typhoid fever in 1945. Second, their ritual utensils, excepting implements for  re-cremation, were burned on Surya’s pyre with embers from their agni-hotra fires. The Duvvuri hearths then were permanently cold when Yajulu returned  home. And third, the punar-dahana re-burning was necessary for Surya, just  as it was for Baballa and Cayanulu. 

Over in Vyaghresvaram a similar situation unfolded in the same year  with the death of Kamesvari Somidevamma, wife of Laksminarayana, leaving  another ahitagni a widower two years before his own passing. It was necessary  to reserve a portion of her cremation fire, grind bone fragments, re-burn, and  offer the ashes with the proper mantras because, like Surya, her body con 

tained soma. This raises a question: neither Surya nor Kamesvari ever drank  soma from a graha cup in soma-bhaksana, soma drinking in a sacrifice. How  then did their bones accumulate soma?67 To explain, some background in the  long history of funeral traditions is necessary. 

Significant agrarian symbols, along with pastoral ones, are expressed in  last rites from the earliest Vedas. The bone-collection rite (asthi-samcayana)  still today follows standard cremation. Requests to Agni to permit the  deceased to join a new body are accompanied by the sprinkling of water on  bone fragments in Rg Veda 10.16.5–6 (cf. AVS 18.2.10; KausS 82.28), suggest 

ing regeneration of life. It is possible that sesa in verse 5 may be the “remnant”  soma the poet declares in verse 6 to be “in” brahmana such as the deceased.  The practice of plowing, seeding, and watering furrows (karsu) on or next to  the cremation mound, then “planting” bones in these beds, is known from  TS 5.2.5.2–5 (cf. SB 13.8.2.1–3) and this appears to be the intention of a dif 

ferent version of losta-citi which bypasses re-cremation in favor of burial of  the entire bone pot. Further, there may be a direct homology between three  soma-pressing days and a vague three-day journey of the deceased expressed  in RV 10.14.16.68

Becoming Agni 243 

There are several possible solutions to the puzzle of the soma-retaining wife  who did not drink it. Stressed throughout this book is the fact that the ahitagni and patni pair is a co-sacrificing unit. Although of different ages at birth, in the  diksa for agni-stoma and every subsequent soma rite they are symbolically born  again at the same moment, bound together by this transformation. A second  consideration is the belief of some that a bride takes her husband’s blood at  marriage.69 Is blood exchange a possible avenue for soma to journey from the  body of the ahitagni to the body of the patni? Soma drinking took place, how 

ever, some decades after the marriage qualification and only soma inherited  by a previous generation of sacrificers would be relevant. If the musi-vayanam ritual performed for Surya and Kamesvari returned the two deceased wives to  their bridal moments, pre-pubescent girls with natal family blood, they both  would have been soma-free. 

Perhaps the question is too esoteric to consider further but there is another  explanation that satisfies more than one somi-devamma family. A wife eats  the leftovers of her husband’s food and over the course of many years soma is  transferred into her bones. In the case of Surya, a marriage of fifty-one years  after agni-stoma meant a considerable period of soma accumulation. 

6.16 Becoming an Ancestor 

Ancestors are everywhere. It is not only the rsi sages who hover within the  river mists of Konasima. Past generations are still present requesting recogni tion and offerings in rituals that keep their names and accomplishments in  mind. American college students, from evidence in classroom questioning,  seldom supply the full name of a single one of their eight great-grandparents.  Ahitagni may provide five to ten generations of names. Connections are rein forced by daily worship (pitr-tarpana), the new-moon-day offerings of water  and rice balls (pinda-dana), and many other rites intended to give satisfaction  (trpti) to the Fathers residing, ever watchfully, in pitr-loka. An important sym biosis is operative here: ancestors survive on human offerings of food rou tinely linked to the lunar cycle, just as humans achieve long life, children, and  prosperity from the beneficence of forefathers. 

Everyone remembers that a person has three debts (rna) in life: to the rsi sages, the gods, and the ancestors, paid respectively by reciting Veda, per forming sacrifices, and raising children. As constant reminders, Samavedam,  whose grandfather performed agni-stoma, always wore two silver rings with  ruby stones on his right forefinger, known in Telugu as tarjanilu, also the name  of the two rings, each engraved with ancestors’ names in deva-nagari letters.

244 vedic voices 

Despite the ubiquity and neediness of ancestors, there is decided ambiva lence about an individual’s fate after death, as is true for the Vedic-Hindu tra dition in general. Contradictions can be controversial even in in the course of  a ritual and some have already been mentioned. For example, wives who die  before their husbands and receive the female-directed musi-vayanam ritual  are dispatched on the tenth day to Gauri-loka, realm of the goddess Gauri.  Two days later, however, male-directed rituals promote them into pitr-hood  via their husbands’ or their own parental ancestors, designating an alto gether different celestial company. And always contentious is the question  of ista-purta, merited results gained from the performance of sacrifices and  other deeds.70 

It may be recalled from his capsule biography in Chapter 3 that Duvvuri  Yajulu learned from an old stranger that his achievement of agni-stoma would  become worthless when he reached his eighties. He connected this prediction  to the prior death of Surya who took their agni-hotra with her on the cremation  pyre. In his mind, the merit from yajna is not permanent. Regarding rebirth,  he said, a record of multiple soma sacrifices, however great, is not enough to  escape the cycle. Accomplished deeds are for cleansing of one’s conscious 

ness (citta-suddhi) and for the pleasure of Paramesvara, the highest god. An  ahitagni, still a householder, cannot escape the route from ancestor to rebirth.  Only the world renouncer has a chance at release. 

Cayanulu took another approach, arguing that merit from sacrifices could  be rewarded with a kind of immortality, not merely with long life and prosper ity. This is a frequent topic in sabha debates: whether or not amrta, immortal ity, is more than the popular desire to see a hundred autumns or a thousand  full moons and whether svarga-loka, heaven, or brahma-loka, the heaven of  Brahma, are permanent or temporary states. Rg Veda 10.14.8 is cited in which  the deceased is invited to receive a new body, join his ancestors with Yama in  the highest heaven, and enjoy the rewards of his sacrifices and good works.  Woven into discussion is a related subject, tyaga, “abandonment” to the gods  of the results (phala, fruit) of one’s ritual labor rather than cashing them in for  eternal reward. 

One expression that surfaces compares the temporary pleasures of heaven  to a holiday resort:  a vacationer may enjoy himself as long as his wallet is  full. When the money runs out he has to go home. Brian Smith mines texts  to describe the sacrificial journey to heaven as a round trip. Whether it is by  bird, cart, ship, or chariot, it is “just long enough to mark out and reserve a  space for the next life.”71 Baballa, in his dying days, appreciated the fact that  his aruna-ketuka sacrifice would reward him with a visit to brahma-loka and,  however briefly, the company of Brahma.

Becoming Agni 245 

As mentioned earlier in the discussion of ancestors in the catur-masya (part 6) those ahitagni who went on to become soma sacrificers are aware of  the privileging of soma-vant ancestors, those who offered and therefore drank  soma. TS 2.6.12.2 reveals two other classes of pitr, barhisad and agni-svatta,  respectively, those who sat on the sacred barhis grass to offer cooked food and  those consumed by Agni in cremations, designations that occurred already  in RV 10.15.4, 11.72 Pandits almost without exception agree that the path to the  Fathers lies ahead. Already when learning the Taittiriya Brahmana they knew  of successive existences beyond the present.73 And yet it is not easy to become  an ancestor. If proper rituals are lacking after cremation the deceased’s dis 

embodied spirit (preta, one who has “departed” from the body) may become  a wandering, troublesome ghost, a bhuta. The Apara Brahman goes to work  precisely to ensure passage to the other world in a ritual program building a  temporary body for the deceased, one to cover the naked, vulnerable spirit that  exited the used body on the pyre. This requires ten days, a gestation of sorts,  just as the embryo in its mother needs ten lunar months before birth, and the  baby and mother stay ten days secluded in the birthing room before entering  the social world. 

The invisible transitional body is constructed a step at a time from head to  internal powers by ten days of mantras with rice ball (pinda), sesame seed (tila),  and water offerings. The carry-over (ati-vahika) body having safely covered the  preta, rituals may now eliminate all the material objects in which the preta 

might have sought momentary refuge. These include a small stone (preta-sila)  worshipped by all in the mourning family; a shroud piece worn by the chief  mourner, usually a son; the rice pinda and the crows who arrive to peck at  leftovers; kusa grass planted and watered; nine different grains (nava-dhanya)  seeded, watered, and fed cooked food daily; a goat either sacrificed or set free  to wander in lieu of immolation; an effigy of leaves, sticks, or powders; and of  course the bone and tooth fragments recovered from the cremation ashes. On  the tenth day all face abandonment (visarjana). One by one each is thrown in  a river or canal, including the sprouting nava-dhanya basket. An exception is  the jar of an ahitagni’s or patni’s twice-burned bone and tooth fragments that is  planted in a plowed furrow. The ashes of all others go into the water.74 

The eleventh day is devoted to feeding bhokta, a degraded subset of  Brahmans willing to be “eaters” of food for the deceased, as in other rituals  they accept dana (gifts) to appease malicious planets such as Sani, Saturn.  The chief mourner, usually a son, serves a full-course feast to eleven of them  in a row, representatives of the eleven Rudras. The twelfth day is another cru 

cial one in which the sapindi-karana conveys the deceased to join ancestors  in svarga, heaven, a journey of a twelve-month year in the older texts but later246 vedic voices 

condensed to a symbolic twelve days, perhaps in concern that a ritual surro gate might die during the lengthy period. 

That surrogate today is a selected bhokta Brahman who assumes the guise  of the deceased and accepts provisions for the year-long journey, an array of  uncooked food that may include ten bags of paddy, a bed, bed linens, clothes  for all seasons, an umbrella, cane, shoes, and gold or cash. It is traditional that  his personification of the dead about to depart this world expresses persistent  demands for more and more supplies. This degraded Brahman leaves and  should not be seen again. He must perform long santi-karma himself to elimi 

nate the dreadful effects of such dangerous gifts. 

Once there is secure reception among the pitr the deceased becomes an  ancestor to the living, bouncing prior ancestors, male or female, up a rung of  the ladder of Vasus, Rudras, Adityas, the closest three generations, with the  Visve-devas, the All-gods, residing in the remote space beyond. As Baballa said  repeatedly, employing his own gendered terms, the self (atman) is situated on  the middle rung of a seven-fold lineage, three generations ahead (father, grand 

father, great-grandfather), three more below (son, grandson, great-grandson).  All those “above” are entitled to sraddha rituals of a daily, monthly, and annual  character, with far more attention paid to closer Fathers. The remote ancestors  receive only token nourishment, rice grains that stick to the offering hand,  since they are in the process of dissolving among the All-gods before return 

ing to this world in other life forms. 

Specific rules apply, however, regarding the one who “leaves water” for  the departed and the frequency of such performance. As Baballa lay dying he  feared that his cancer-ridden son might die before he did, thus preventing this  crucial son-to-father offering. But Bullebayi lived just long enough to leave  water for Baballa before he himself died and his own son, Yajnesvara Prasad,  could continue. As remarked earlier, it is noteworthy that ancestors show up  at soma rites to receive their share of the beverage.75 

The thirteenth day is usually devoted to an assembly of regional Veda  pandits in a memorial session of respectful debates and encomia to honor  the deceased. With the fortnight of rituals completed the agrahara or hamlet  returns to routines of the living. The house of the deceased, as in the cases of  Lanka, Cayanulu, and others, may be closed for a year to clear it of “dust and  wind,” a generic Telugu term for hauntings by evil spirits. Mrtyu is asked to  remain at a reasonable distance.76

## 7 Epilogue 

Becoming “Modern” 

Children born in the United States 1982–2002, the period bracketing  the turn of the millennium, are known as Millennials, as those born in the  decade after World War II, 1945–55, were dubbed Baby Boomers. Seeking labels  for the generations of Andhra pandits discussed here we might call the old 

est set Traditionalists, a group that included Baballa, Lanka, Duvvuri Yajulu,  Bulusu Cayanalu, and Gullapalli Sita Ram Sastri, as well as Renducintala  Venkatacalu Yajulu, Kapilavayi Yajnesvara Agnihotra Sastri, and others. They  had all grown up with what Chinese culture esteems as filial piety, particularly  with regard to the father-son relationship, which in Vedic Brahmanical terms  usually means guru-student. For them there was strict adherence to the rules  for sandhya-vandana, adhyaya, marriage and other rites of passage, yajna, and  subsequent sacrifices when they chose to perform them. With few exceptions,  parental will and authority were obeyed without question. Baballa, one of six  ahitagni brothers, is an example of generational fidelity to the path of his ahi tagni father and his father’s ancestors. 

In turn, the sons and daughters of Traditionalists came of age in a period  of shifting cultural norms, a time when choices that seemed inconceivable to  their parents gradually became available. All seven of Lanka and Anasuya’s  sons, all six of Bulusu Kamesvara and Satyavati’s sons, and both sons of Bulusu  Cayanulu chose careers outside the Vaidika path of their parents. Of the five  sons of Yajulu and Surya, the eldest, Sarvesvara, prepared for, but eventu 

ally declined, the ritual path of his father, and three other sons chose worldly  careers, leaving only Surya Prakasa Avadhani as a potential sacrificer. That role  he and Kanaka Durga eventually abandoned for health reasons in 2014. On the  other hand, all five of Sita Ram Sastri’s sons, unburdened by pursuit of a sacri 

ficing legacy, became highly successful Veda pandits to continue the teaching  heritage of their distinguished parent. Two of the four sons of Samavedam  achieved similar aims. This second generation had a checkered pattern and  could be called the Selecters, those who chose between options, Vaidika and  laukika, a preference that many of their parents did not deem possible.

The next generation in this delta narrative brings us into the age of comput ers and information technology, yet a further distancing from the traditions of  the early and mid-twentieth century. In fact, the “IT” generation, like “TV” a  recognizably pan-Indian English acronym, is not an inappropriate label since  a few of the Traditionalists’ grandsons left India to accept computer services  employment abroad. Perhaps Opportunists is a better tag for those leaping  into careers totally apart from both parental and grandparental generations.  There are several aspects of modern changes with which to explore the distinc tions between these generations. 

E.1 A New Cash Economy 

The standard of living has changed. Money is necessary to live  now, not the exchange of services between Brahmans and others. Dhupala Ramacandra Sastri, Head of Veda-Agama  

Pathasala, November 17, 1980 

Baballa, Lanka, Mitrnarayana, and other older pandits spoke frequently of  their disillusionment with the dabbu (money) culture of modern India. On  the other hand, Samavedam was not at all displeased to receive paper rupees  instead of paddy or vegetables for his services reciting asir-vacanam blessings  and welcomed the opportunity to buy personal items or turn the cash into  dowry payments. Dowry debt, in fact, has always been one of the crippling  features of economic life, an obstacle to financial solvency. Lanka paid Rs.  400 katnam (dowry fee) when giving his daughter Anasuya to Mitranarayana.  “No land,” he said, “just cash. And I have been in debt my whole life.” An  arrangement such as the Gullapalli-Duvvuri exchanges of sons and daugh ters discussed in Chapter 5 is one method of alleviating indebtedness. For  another, it may be recalled that Cayanulu taught Veda to a son of his friend  Renducintala in exchange for a dowry-less marriage with his daughter. The  boy, Renducintala Satyanarayana Avadhani, lived in the house with Cayanulu,  Subbalaksmi, and his future bride for the years of adhyaya until marriage in  Vijayawada when he was fifteen and the girl was ten. 

Attitudes toward money do in fact reveal a separation between gen erations. It was their loathing of veda-vikraya, the selling of Veda, that kept  Traditionalists such as Baballa and Lanka from accepting any parayana posi tion with the TTD. Selecters and Opportunists, who had no such qualms, wel comed the steady income from a monthly check and a future pension plan.  Financial independence for the family became more important than the strict  distancing from rupee transactions so cherished by some elders, those who 

Epilogue: Becoming “Modern” 249 

regarded salaries for Veda pandits as filthy lucre. The Traditionalists were  fiercely guarded in many ways. Lanka, for example, remarked that any milk  from the agni-hotra buffalo left over from daily offerings and family consump tion was always given away. “Selling milk just once,” he said with a bizarre  analogy, “is the karmic equivalent of torturing fish for a year.” Such dogmatic  circumspection, like Lanka’s refusal to use chemical fertilizers or hybrid seeds  on his croplands, has all but disappeared today. 

E.2 Mobility 

In the past we did not stir out of our villages. Now we receive  

constant invitations to go to other places, Hyderabad, Delhi,  

Ujjaini, elsewhere. And in the past there was contentment,  

satisfaction with life. Now there is no contentment. 

Mitranarayana, April 22, 1989 

Another striking feature of the new era is mobility, a freedom to move farther and  more frequently from the agrahara. Routine boat traffic on the canals, bullock  carts, horse tongas, and man-pulled rickshaws are quaint memories or tall tales for  most people today. Buses rumble by on more or less regular schedules, the occa 

sional taxi is available for an emergency or special event, and for longer distances a  relatively short bus ride provides access to the gargantuan Indian railway system.  Cars that changed American society with the arrival of Henry Ford’s Model T are  now on the market for India’s middle class. The Tata Nano, unveiled in New Delhi  in January 2008 at the rupee equivalent of $2,000, appeared exactly a century  after Ford’s “Tin Lizzie” and may have much the same effect on Indian society. For  those four rubber tires, not wooden bullock cart wheels, the National Highways  Development Project provided the beginnings of the Golden Quadrilateral, 3,625  miles of four-and-six-lane highways crossing thirteen states. A  portion of the  Kolkata-Chennai segment runs through the delta near Ravulapalem. Still today,  however, most residents of the delta, with the exception of the lucky few in a hired  taxi for a wedding party, have never been in a car. In 1992 one of Lanka’s success ful laukika sons was the first in any ahitagni family to own a car, a Maruti. 

Public transportation by train, bus, or shared taxi means of course rub bing shoulders with outsiders, an immense hurdle for ahitagni and awkwardly  distasteful for teaching Veda pandits managing madi, ritual purity. This  is a leading reason for limited movement. And yet both groups, for whom  long-distance journeys were rare before the 1960s, have indulged in travel  to an increasing degree over the decades. As discussed in Chapters 2 and 6,  agni-hotrin found ways to cope with hearth maintenance and requisite isti

performance while absent. Recruitment of someone to serve as adhvaryu, brah man, or other rtvij role could mean travel to another state, usually Tamil Nadu,  or attendance at a major sabha, perhaps in Kanci, or all-expense paid trips for  special occasions such as the sixtieth and seventieth birthdays of Satya Sai  Baba, in which cases wives were included in the festivities. Mentioned earlier  is the case of Samavedam and his two sons, traveling anywhere by whatever  conveyance, as long as an honorarium and travel expenses were forthcoming  for their recitations. In the Tirupati temple in 1980, the Foreigner and his  wife were delighted to encounter four Gullapalli brothers, Samavedam, and  other Konasima friends among the sixteen Veda pandits belting out antipho 

nal ghana in a Varuna puja, an attempt to bring rain to the Seven Hills. The  pandits’ train journey south from Rajahmundry was successful and temple  dignitaries were all pleased that mantras defeated the drought. 

The most recent development is air travel. Lanka was flown to Delhi in  May 1994 to receive a citation from the president of India. He was the only one  of the ahitagni to travel in an airplane, an experience he never dreamed would  happen. On the other hand, Duvvuri Sita Ram Sastry, one of Yajulu’s com 

puter science grandsons, did relate his nocturnal dream of flying to Kennedy  Airport in New York where he was met by President Clinton and his secretary  of state, Madeleine Albright. The flight was a dream soon realized, although it  lacked such a grand welcoming party. 

E.3 Huna-vidya: A Rival Form of Education 

Reading and writing I acquired in the course of time. I never  

went to school. There was no activity other than Veda. 

Duvvuri Yajulu, March 28, 1992 

The spirit of Vedic life has disappeared. Now huna-vidya,  

vocational proficiency, livelihood, are all that matters to the  

younger generation, not rituals. 

Mitranarayana, March 26, 1992 

Yajulu spoke in the old coinage: 12 pice to an anna, 16 annas to a rupee. He  loved to tell a story from his youth when a boatman shortchanged him with  pice in a broken coconut shell after he paid to cross the Godavari River. The  boatman showed up later with the balance, saying it was a test to verify what  he suspected: the boy could not count. Like others of the old school Yajulu  took pride in a record of learning Veda before reading, writing, and arithme 

tic. Late in his life he tried to help negotiate marriage arrangements for a 

Epilogue: Becoming “Modern” 251 

granddaughter in a time when a typical newspaper ad sought a “Fair beautiful  MSc. Software handling bride.” “She has no B.A.,” he lamented, “and cannot  go out and earn the money that parents want for their sons now.” 

Mitranarayana’s comment broaches the vexing and complicated matter of  an English curriculum in public schools mentioned in several previous chap ters. Labeled by the older Veda pandits huna-vidya, literally “the practice of  the Huns,” that is, British invaders/colonizers, the English curriculum was  abhorred for its interference in traditional Vedic adhyaya. According to the  elders, learning in the agrahara should begin at dawn or earlier, even 4 am,  and if the boy is expected to be in an outside school at eight o’clock the sched ule is untenable. More important than timing was the matter of content, of  what constitutes learning. The boy’s mind, says the old generation, should  be fresh and open to retain the flow of the Taittiriya syllables, not stuffed with  ephemera like math and other subjects that can always be learned, as they learned them, later. The younger generation, having witnessed the advantages  and wider perspectives of learning English and computer skills, among other  subjects, has distanced itself, respectfully, from grandparental views. The  middle generation is stuck somewhere between these viewpoints, having seen  mediocrity or outright failure as the result of a boy’s divided mind. 

The English-speaking world represents to the elders a laukika world that is  intrusive and divisive. The Traditionalists and Selecters speak no English while  Opportunists have become accustomed to hearing some English in school and  even more via TV-TV (as it is called), particularly after the appearance of Star  TV with programs available in English. Bookstore aisles contain English texts  on biology, chemistry, math, physics (never anthropology, history, religious  studies, sociology), all in preparation for the Indian Council for Secondary  Education, SAT and GRE exams. The sons of Surya Prakasa Avadhani (grand sons of Duvvuri Yajulu) were the first to learn any English in their school in  the large town of Rajahmundry, the eldest, Phani, being the only youngster in  this entire survey to learn Veda and English simultaneously. The net effects of  English education in India are increasing yearly, although still it is true that  only a tiny fraction of the populace speaks or reads the language. 

E.4 The Powers That Be 

All people should not be equal! 

Lanka, December 29, 1991 

Although agrahara life is decidedly not the same as existence in a typi cal Andhra village or town there is no lack of awareness of what goes on 

252 vedic voices 

in the outside world. Cayanulu, for example, cycled daily to recite in a tem ple in nearby Vyaghresvaram village and Duvvuri Surya Prakasa lives in  Rajahmundry, recites in a temple, and teaches in his orchard compound. In  Sriramapuram and Nedunuru, people from all social strata come to supply  and service agrahara residents and inform them of current events, local, state wide, and national. Radio was there for the oldest generation after electricity  arrived, and television was available for the two recent ones. Suddenly a single  “TV-TV” appeared on Main Road in Rajahmundry, drawing crowds of shop pers to stare at what seemed like a lighted bird house atop a tall pole. Soon  the crowds shifted to lanes where homes of the wealthy glowed with magical  blue light and locked steel gates provided ladders for distant gawkers. When  visiting pandit homes in the 1990s the TV, like that initial single dangling  light bulb for an earlier generation, seemed always to be on for the ladies in an  interior room. “But we don’t have color” became an apologetic refrain, at least  until they did have color. 

Although no pandit would admit to having gone there, a single cin ema, Jaya Prakasa Talkies, was visible for many years across the canal from  Sriramapuram. With the advent of TV in nearly every house in the late 1990s  it suddenly disappeared. In January 1987 agrahara residents joined their fel low citizens nationwide in the devotional event of watching the great epic  Ramayana, a serial television broadcast on Sunday mornings, a drama that  for many legitimized the suspect medium itself. The silver screen in cinema  hall form had already claimed the devotion of millions of Andhrans with the  appearances of N. T. Ramarao (NTR) as Krishna or Rama in epic films; he  starred in more than 300 from 1949 on. When NTR turned to politics in 1982  and led the Telugu Desam Party in defiance of Indira Gandhi he successfully  won office as chief minister, the first person outside the Congress Party to hold  the state’s highest post. He died of a sudden heart attack in 1996 and the entire  state shut down in mourning for the screen deity turned politician. Several  agonized fans committed suicide. A samadhi was established in Hyderabad,  as for a saint, and his ashes were ceremonially deposited with Vedic mantras  throughout Andhra, including the Godavari at Muktesvaram in Konasima and  Kotlinga revu in Rajahmundry. 

With so many available forms of communication, any distancing from  the external world is therefore self-chosen. Lanka once interrupted a discus sion of dharma to pose his own query: “Who is in power now?” He meant  the central government in Delhi. At the time he most certainly knew it was  Congress Party but his expression of disdain for any form of worldly politics  was as important to him as his estrangement from a constantly changing  democratic system in Delhi. More than once he praised the days of British 

Epilogue: Becoming “Modern” 253 

rule. “They did nothing bad to us and they encouraged merit. Now it is our government that is bad.” At the same time his comment “All people should  not be equal!” displays his adherence to varanasrama dharma, the classical  system of hierarchy and stage of life, everyone in place according to birth,  age, profession, and gender. 

One common thread in agrahara conversations was a new sense of the  growing powerlessness of Brahmans in society in general. Brahmans, by a  “natural” hierarchy in accordance with scripture from the Rg Veda’s Purusa  Sukta to Dharma Sastra, should be on top, prestige-wise if not always in  terms of economics or polity. The Indian constitution and decades of  Indian’s version of affirmative action, however, tweaked the old rules. In  1980 at the start of research for this book, the Delhi government’s Mandal  Commission submitted its report recommending a 27  percent quota sys tem for large portions of the population, “Backward Classes,” “Scheduled  Castes,” “Scheduled Tribes”—all those disadvantaged by “the Hindu social  scheme.” Gradually, over time, the masses had real weight and competi 

tive opportunities. Brahmans could no longer count on posts in village,  state, and central governments, seats in college and university departments,  shares of governmental largesse. This leveling of the playing field was unset tling to Veda pandits. Some pointed to distressing news of self-immolations  of upper caste protestors against the report. Later, however, they displayed  a measure of pride in 1993 when India’s prime minister, P. V. Narasimha  Rao, a much-respected fellow Andhran, announced implementation of the  report some thirteen years after its composition.1 The school at the end of  Sriramapuram’s single lane was opened to all castes and this was accepted  without agitation. 

It is perhaps the newest generation, the Opportunists, that has the most  favorable opinions of the ruling powers of state and nation. Already discussed  in Chapters  3 and 5 is one example, the significant change regarding fam ily planning. From the Traditionalists’ point of view contraception is unnatu ral and contrary to Dharma Sastra. A strong battery of Vedic texts is quickly  recited touting the purpose of marriage as the production of children to con tinue the lineage, governmental attempts at planned parenting being a med dling with family values. As in other ways the Selecters were divided while the  Opportunists wholeheartedly embraced the national slogan “We are two, we  have two.” Duvvuri Phani and Laksmi (Nagalaksmi) added two sons to their  union in 1996 and 1998, declaring the second to be “the final” child. It could  be said that Dharma Sastra rules were outweighed by the economic advantage  of being a small family. The days of ten- or twelve-child families were num bered well before the turn of the millennium.

E.5 “America”: Polarities and Dreams 

What is it all about, this ‘going to America’? Anasuya,  

February 24 2000 

From a distance the mountains look soft. Lanka, March 22, 1995 

Anasuya, a lifelong Traditionalist whose father, grandfather, great-grandfather,  and husband Lanka were all ahitagni, was perplexed when ahitagni descen dants, including one of her sons, began leaving agrahara for that strangely  menacing other-worldly place called “America.” Lanka, who failed to teach  Veda to a single one of their seven sons, assessed that departing son’s chances  of succeeding abroad with a grim proverb: a closer look at his foreign home  will reveal rugged, forbidding peaks. Anasuya, capitulating to the loss,  lamented: “When they go, they don’t come back.” 

The pandit community’s opinions of “America” comprise a fascinating and  complicated subject that morphed in various ways over the research period.  A  small part concerns the researcher himself, this white Foreigner (tela-dora)  who knows much about Vedas, sacrifices, samskara, and recites mantras learned,  mirabile dictu, in Kasi, one who repeatedly appears to pose questions about their  lives. Samavedam expressed the sentiments of many: “It is wonderful that some 

one from America is so dedicated to our traditions.” Baballa went further and  expressed a belief shared with Yajulu and others: “He belongs to our country, our  region, our place. Only to propagate Veda was he born in that other place.” 

A wider perspective with which to begin, however, is the Dharma Sastra  dictum that a Brahman should not live in inauspicious lands, places where  mlelccha (barbarians) might contaminate him. Manu 3.158 condemns those  who travel by sea and Bhaskara Misra admonishes those who incur the sin  or fault (dosa) of being in an inauspicious country.2 In 1980 the Foreigner  enjoyed long discussions on the Atharva Veda with Tangiral Balagangadhara  Sastri, one of Lanka’s gurus, in his Sarvaraya Veda Patha-sala in the bucolic  village of Kapilesvarapuram. He was one of the six Veda pandits teaching  twenty-five students. In 1993 Sastri-garu was encountered again at an Atharva  Veda Conference in Manhattan where he recited from his seldom heard Veda.  There in New York City, adjacent to the United Nations headquarters among  gigantic skyscrapers, so unimaginable to one secluded on the north bank of  the Gautami-Godavari in Konasima, he confessed his trepidation about cross ing the ocean. To the surprise of all the Veda pandits, Sastri-garu returned as  the same person, apparently undamaged by American soil, food, customs, and  evil eyes. It was the beginning of a slow transformation of opinion regarding  that dangerous and remote land of iniquity.

Epilogue: Becoming “Modern” 255 

Transcripts from sessions with pandits in the 1980s glitter with negative  views of America, a place of magic, mystery, and money, full of people who  drink alcohol excessively, communicate by sorcery over wrist watches like  Dick Tracy or James Bond, carry cameras that cause photographed objects to  burst into flames, and frolic as spendthrifts with fabulous wealth. Lanka once  asked: “How is it that Americans are so wealthy? Is there a lot of gold just lying  about?”—a remark that called to mind Herodotus’ gold-mining ants that made  the people of India so rich. 

As mentioned earlier, in the late 1980s the Foreigner and the Andhra  University professor began to read to the younger pandits letters the youth had  received from Hindu temples in Chicago, Pittsburgh, Atlanta, Houston, and  other cities, invitations via the TTD to recite daily as Yajur Veda pandits. The  letters were all in English and of course had gone unread. After hearing the  invitations no one responded, all citing fear of excommunication by older pun 

dits, including fathers and grandfathers, their gurus. Yajulu was among the  fathers who simply forbade such thoughts of foreign employment. “Selling  the Veda,” said Lanka, terminating discussion. Samavedam’s son Bhaskara  might have been a likely candidate. But he was fond of narrating two accounts,  one of a Brahman from Gangalakurru who returned from America and found  that no one would eat in the same line with him, while another Brahman was  in America when his father’s funeral took place without him, a horrendous  thing to do to a guru and parent. 

Opposition to such travel did shrink, however, when long-term effects of  a 1965 change in US immigration laws became apparent. Young men sought  employment in the United States, came home to marry, and soon added par ents to their new American homes. It seemed that someone from every village  in Andhra dropped anchor in the United States and reported back a quite  different perspective from received knowledge. Over-the-counter medicines  became popular gifts; plain aspirin, available in India at one-tenth the price,  was proudly shown to the Foreigner as if it cured cancer. In America, it was  said in hushed tones, everyone receives free life-saving injections and lives  to be ninety years old. News soon came that not only were there Hindu tem 

ples in America but that some were staffed with Telugu priests who served  Venkatesvara while other Brahmans recited Vedas! It was of course the “I.T.”  phase that led the march, the outsourcing of computer technologists who at  first manned telephones in Hyderabad or Bangalore and then began to emi 

grate. Dollars were no longer the tainted wealth of filmi stories but now a valu able asset. By 2008 it was reported that Indian citizens working in the United  States had the highest annual amount of dollar remittances to the home coun try of all foreign nationals: $27 billion.3256 vedic voices 

Several descendants of ahitagni were reported in earlier chapters to be com puter specialists trained in Hyderabad before emigrating to the United States.  One is Duvvuri Sita Ram Sastry, grandson of Yajulu and also of Gullapalli Sita  Ram Sastri, now living with his wife and two children in Hartford, Connecticut.  A failure at learning Veda, he devoted himself to providing financial support  for his family in Andhra. A cousin who is also a grandson of Yajulu performs  similar computer technology services in Milwaukee. As for Yajulu himself,  after the Foreigner’s leave-taking one sunbaked afternoon in Sriramapuram,  the blind and halting nonagenarian mischievously shouted:  “Tell them in  America I am looking for employment!” 

All Veda pandit family histories have revealed multiple changes in transi tions from the older to the middle to the new generations and from the age  of man-pulled rickshaws to flat-screen TVs and laptops. None has retained  the features of life in the early twentieth century. Baballa’s descriptions of his  Konasima childhood life at the outset of the twentieth century seem quite  mythic to residents of the same hamlets today. They are seeing the results  of one hundred years of ballooning populations; expansion of towns, roads,  communications, and amenities; political and social tinkering with the caste  system; intrusion of the British curriculum and some of its language into pub 

lic education; presentations of the wider world on radio, television, and film;  firsthand accounts from those who had defied Manu, traveled over the great  oceans, and somehow returned alive, well, and worldly wise. 

The narrow dirt track that Lanka walked in the dark to and from his daily  lessons is long gone, replaced by an asphalt road for motor vehicles. The  servant courier walking with spoken messages for another village has been  swapped for a cell phone. The many coins that added up to a rupee have been  replaced by large denominations on paper or a bank check. While not the  “digital natives” of American Millennials, Indian students are entirely familiar  with the meaning of the Internet and the new social media. Certain aspects of  domestic ritual life have been abbreviated, a few samskara, for example. Girls  and women of the household are not as artistic as they used to be in creat ing the predawn threshold designs (muggu) of rice or lime powder, if there  is time to do them at all. And people are living longer. About the middle of  the research period for this book came the report that life expectancy in India  had risen from thirty-two years in 1947, when Duvvuri Yajulu was exactly  thirty-two, to fifty-nine in 1991, an astonishing increase of twenty-seven years.  Yajulu lived to be ninety. 

In taking the measure of a Veda pandit life that is supported by convention,  stamina (opika), sobriety, dharmic responsibility, and above all, adherence to  ritual schedule and detail, it is important to discern the impact of “modernity.” 

Epilogue: Becoming “Modern” 257 

The sense that the Vedic tradition is being consumed by modernity has been  afloat for much of the past three decades. It is a misleading apprehension,  however, and is shared mostly by those families whose sons failed to learn  Veda, or never tried, and settled for worldly careers. 

Families with successful sons actually believe that their numbers have  increased. And when sons achieved certification and entered into temple  employment the steady income meant a considerable improvement over for mer times. 

The accelerated pace of modern changes received an enormous boost in the  period 2010 to 2014, something like a jet-assisted cultural take-off. Kapilavayi  Rama Sastri in Annavaram is a good illustration, driving a car, living in a  new multi-floor private house glistening with electronics to match the most  up-to-date American home: flat-screen TV, laptops, I-pads, I-pods, and possi 

bly I-things that are yet to appear in Silicon Valley. And brother Venkatesvara  over in Simhacalam, also bearded, also wealthy, first to own a motorcycle, is  now driving his own car. One might think that Glinda had floated in from Oz  to endow the delta with all the treasures of the New Age. 

Many aspects of life, however, remain unchanged. When the sun rises or  sets each day it is just about six o’clock. The distinctive colorations of rice fields  that line the roads, asphalt or dirt, transform as always with every season, and  the expert coconut picker still shinnies barefoot up the bristly trunks with  ankles bound in rope. But above all, the lessons that Baballa and Lanka heard  and repeated back so many years ago are exactly the same today, as are the  basic procedures of an ahitagni ritual life. 

In the early 1990s the delta was opened to drilling by the ONGC, India’s  Oil and Natural Gas Company. Large-scale road construction enabled mas sive equipment to reach the littoral of the Bay of Bengal. Then a spectacular  “blowout” occurred in well number 19 on January 8, 1995, at Pasarlipudi and  dangerous horizontal flames shot hundreds of feet in all directions, lighting  up Konasima and frightening everyone in the delta. No one had seen anything  like it. Vedic Brahmans began to recite mantras. Astrologers were consulted  about this eerie phenomenon and one with Veda pandit ancestry assured the  Foreigner that sabda, sacred sound, either mantras or slokas, “both are the  same,” would solve the problem. One day a group of hulking Texans, complete  with spurs, Stetson hats, and bulging beer bellies, appeared on the road outside  Amalapuram, as inconspicuous as a squadron of Martians landing in town.  They set to work first turning the flames into a vertical inferno a thousand feet  in the air, then capping the well with a robot. When the fire finally fizzled and  went out after burning sixty-five days, the Vedic Brahmans announced that  their mantras had been the correct ones. The Brahman astrologer demurred 

258 vedic voices 

and proclaimed that certain planets whose paths he routinely stalks had fortu nately changed course on March 10, as he predicted. Others said the well fire  had burned itself out, “as do most fires.” No one gave the Martians credit and  they all flew back to Texas. 

There is something to be said here regarding the persistence of world views in the face of altered cultural landscapes. The softly uttered morning  and evening Gāyatrī prayer, Ṛg Veda 3.62.10, once heard only in India, is now  comfortably at home in Hartford, Milwaukee, San Diego. 

oṃ tat savitur vareṇyaṃ / bhargo devasya dhīmahi / dhiyo yo naḥ  pracodayāt oṃ 

May we achieve the divine splendor of Savitṛ; may he illumine our  minds.
