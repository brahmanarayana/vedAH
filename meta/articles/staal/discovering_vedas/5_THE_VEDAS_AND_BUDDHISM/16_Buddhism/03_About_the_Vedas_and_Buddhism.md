title = "03 About the Vedas and Buddhism"

+++

Are we getting immersed in details, history and geography, and losing the forest for the trees? I have three general quotes to keep the reader on our track of discovery, two from modern scholars, one from Indian philosophy and a small Indic diversion to widen the perspective before we take a plunge into deeper waters.

The Rigveda went further than deriving pleasure from poetry and poetics. It presents us with a positive outlook on life that is not absent from the Sāmaveda, becomes more turbid in the Yajurveda and returns in the Upaniṣads. I am not preaching a return to the Vedic life or adoption of the Buddhist path. I am looking for light they may throw on each other and what we can learn from this. Here a quote about the spirit of the Rigveda from Wendy Doniger in her chapter on ‘Realia’ is useful. It does more than that label suggests and was written, I am sure, without the author giving Buddhism a thought:
>
> The *Rig Veda* is a sacred book, but it is a very worldly sacred book. Nowhere can we find the tiniest suspicion of a wish to renounce the material world in favour of some spiritual quest; religion is the handmaiden of worldly life. The gods are invoked to give the worshipper the things he wants—health, wealth, long life and progeny. That is not to say that there is anything superficial about Vedic religious concerns, but merely that these meditations stem from a life-affirming, joyous celebration of human existence.

Buddha did not display so positive a spirit. Neither did he seek support from the Vedas by invoking them for legitimation, whether innovatively or out of context as did the Purāṇas and other later perspectives on India’s past. Does it imply that we are now ready, after fifteen chapters on the Vedas, to plunge into Buddhism without further ado? We must first ask what kind of thing Buddhism is. Are we comparing incompatibles? In partial response to that question, I shall quote Etienne Lamotte, a Catholic priest, and generally regarded as the greatest Buddhist scholar of the twentieth century. He never made comparisons but had some affinity with the topic:
>
> Adhesion to the Buddhist faith does not require that the adept rejects his ancestral beliefs or denounces the religious practices that are current in his *milieu*. Through one of those compromises of which India has given so many examples, everyone is free to worship apart from the Three Treasures \(Buddha, Dharma and Sangha, p. 307\), the deities of his region, caste or choice and perform the appropriate rites. Throughout history one meets with famous Buddhists who continue their worship of spirits, Nāga and Suparṇa, Yakṣa, Vajrapāṇi, Women and Fairies. Householders, benefactors of the Sangha, remain loyal to the gods of their class: Kuvera, spirit of riches; Hāritī, the fairy with the children; the tutelary Couple, etc. The higher castes continue their demand for the great Vedic and Brahmanic deities: Indra, Brahmā, Māra, etc. The advent of Buddhism has never produced a ‘twilight of the gods’. Śākyamuni does not oppose the pagan gods of Hinduism. He recognizes that ‘the deities, honoured and worshipped by man, will in turn honour and worship him.’ He does not condemn pagan rites: he disapproves of sacrifice in which living beings are killed; he recommends peaceful offerings devoid of cruelty; certain practices based upon pure superstition, ritual baths, etc., are practically without value. What is important is to put everything in its place: gifts to pious monks are better than the cults of the gods; taking refuge in the Three Treasures is better than giving gifts; the highest achievement of sacrifice is to enter the order.

The Cārvāka materialist school had no compunction with regard to the Vedas but most of its works are lost. The Advaita philosopher Śrī Harṣa, who lived in the twelfth century CE, wrote an epic poem about Nala’s adventures which Phyllis Granoff, the leading expert on his philosophic work, called ‘lusty’. Here is how Śrī Harṣa presents Cārvāka, tucked away by Surendranath Dasgupta in an appendix to the first and hidden at the end of the third volume of his monumental *History of Indian Philosophy*:
>
> The scriptural view that the performance of sacrifices produces wonderful results is directly contradicted by experience, and is as false as the Purāṇic story of the floating of stones. It is only those who are devoid of wisdom and capacity for work who earn a livelihood by the Vedic sacrifices, or the carrying of three sticks, or the besmearing of the forehead with ashes. There is no certainty of the purity of castes, for, considering the irrepressible sex-emotions of men and women, it is impossible to say that any particular lineage has been kept pure throughout its history in the many families on its maternal and paternal sides. Men are not particular in keeping themselves pure, and the reason they are so keen to keep the women in the harem is nothing but jealousy; it is unjustifiable to think that unbridled sex-indulgence brings any sin or that sins bring suffering and virtues happiness in another birth; for who knows what will happen in the other birth when in this life we often see that sinful men prosper and virtuous people suffer?

Early Buddhism was very ascetic but adopted a Middle Way. Buddha rejected the extremes he had tried himself under the guidance of Yoga masters before he reached enlightenment. Buddhism was, accordingly, faulted by adherents of more severe traditions. Rarely fair or balanced, they may be amusing as is the following quote from a Jaina source, translated from the German translation by Hermann Oldenberg in his monograph *Buddha: His Life, His Doctrine and His Order*:
>
> Resting on a soft bed during the night,

> Followed by a good drink in the morning.

> Eating before noon, drinking in the evening,

> Sucking sweets before dozing off—

> Finally reaching Supreme Enlightenment:

> Thus goes the fancy of the Śākyamuni.
