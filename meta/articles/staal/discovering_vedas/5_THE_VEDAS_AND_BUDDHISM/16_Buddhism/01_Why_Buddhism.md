Kāśyapa or Mahākāśyapa, whose first name was Pippali, was born in Magadha around the fifth century BCE. His name comes from *kaśyapa* which means ‘tortoise’ and is a non-Indo-European word. His father, Kapila, was a rich brahman, perhaps a descendant of a Vedic family of Indic origins. *Kapila* is a Vedic colour term referring to a brownish hue, perhaps derived from *kapi* or ‘monkey’. His mother’s name was Sumanādevī. He married Bhadrā Kāpilānī, a girl from Śākala but the marriage was not consummated. Both decided to retire from the world and went their own ways as was not uncommon during those Upaniṣadic times at the end of the Veda. They left their names which provide us with some information, but a great deal more is known about Kāśyapa.

Just as Kāśyapa or Kaśyapa is an old Vedic name, *pippala* refers to the fig tree after which the Paippalāda school of the Atharvaveda was named. Was Kāśyapa a follower of that school, which originated further west but certainly existed in Magadha by that time? It would not contradict the fact that his fiancée came from Sialkot in the Punjab—another couple of hundred miles even further to the west. Prominent people had long been settled by that time but were travelling widely and mostly on foot.

Kāśyapa’s path crossed that of the Buddha, recently enlightened and already surrounded by throngs of followers. The Buddha led him aside, gave him three pieces of advice and admitted him to the Sangha or order. They exchanged robes. Eight days later, the Buddha declared that Kāśyapa was the first who followed ‘the ascetic rules’—thirteen as mentioned in the Pali texts of the Theravāda or ‘Doctrine of the Elders’, and twelve in the traditions of the Mahāyāna, the ‘Great Vehicle’, sometimes preserved in Sanskrit, but often lost in India and better preserved in Chinese and other languages. Fragments of such texts are sometimes preserved in pots, found until very recently in Pakistan and Afghanistan.

The Theravāda is sometimes called Hīnayāna, the ‘Abandoned Vehicle’, a pejorative attributed to followers of the Mahāyāna. The Theravāda went from India to Sri Lanka and spread over South-east Asia. The Mahāyāna went to Central Asia, China, Korea, Japan, Tibet and Mongolia. The story of Kāśyapa’s conversion is preserved in both traditions which differ in many respects but are equally valid for our knowledge of Buddhism.

Traditions agree that Mahākāśyapa, now ‘the Great Turtle’, outlived the Buddha and was an important figure in early Buddhism. How do we distinguish traditions from facts? The early development of Buddhism was undoubtedly oral, but it did not use techniques for its preservation like the Vedic. We must pick carefully among the many traditions, even if they agree, until we reach the dated inscriptions of Emperor Aśoka who lived some centuries later—from 268 to 233 BCE. The ‘picking’ can only be done by experts. They would reject the tradition that Kāśyapa composed the *Abhidharma Pi*ṭ*aka*, the important third of the three baskets *pi*ṭ*aka*. They should be distinguished from the three jewels \(*ratna*\): Buddha, Dhama and Sangha treasures, neither Buddha nor Sangha occur in the Vedas. But the word *dharma* is common from the Rigveda onward. Referring to rituals performed for the gods who were performing rituals themselves, the late hymn to Puruṣa \(*Three: Civilization and Society*\) exclaims: ‘Those were the First Dharmas\!’ \(*tāni dharmāṇi prathamāny āsan*\). Of course, the word *dharma* did not mean the same. Words change their meanings.

It is generally accepted that Mahākāśyapa presided over the first Buddhist Council which sought to settle what the Buddha had taught and about which we have much information. He was then said to be the seniormost of the monks alive and questioned others about what they remembered of Buddha’s words. It is through brahmans like him that the Vedas could have influenced Buddhism. Or did Buddhism influence the Vedas? That depends, in the first place, on history and chronology. But are we not rushing ahead before addressing a weightier question: are we not comparing incompatible entities? Is not Buddhism a ‘religion’ founded by a historical person while I have repeatedly stated and demonstrated that the Vedas are not a religion, in that or any of the many accepted meanings of the term? These seem to be questions we have to answer before we can even begin. As a matter of fact, we cannot; but will pursue them in the following pages.

Let us return once more to Kāśyapa. When he felt that his end was near, the earth engulfed and concealed him until the end of times when Maitreya, the future Buddha, appeared and received from his hands the Buddha’s robe.

It is not easy to determine whether the Vedas influenced Buddhism, but there is plenty of evidence in the texts of the Pali canon that their authors—Buddhist monks—were well informed even about details of Vedic mantras and ritual. Words of mantras such as the Gāyatrī, are quoted in Pali transliteration. It is known that the mantra consists of three lines of eight syllables as we have seen in Chapter 11. Details of Śrauta and other rituals are referred to, including the *aśvamedha* horse sacrifice and the human sacrifice \(see chapter 12\). It is typical monkish knowledge, not intended for Buddhist laymen who are not conversant with these details. How did Buddhist monks acquire such knowledge? It is obvious that it comes from brahman converts such as Kāśyapa.

I shall end this brief discussion with an apparent case of Buddhist influence on an early Upaniṣad. The relevant passage occurs in the early Chāndogya Upaniṣad and I have quoted it already at the outset of Part III but without including its conclusion. I shall repeat it here, beginning with sage Uddālaka Āruṇi instructing his son Śvetaketu and now adding the conclusion:
>
> ‘Bring a banyan fruit.’

> ‘Here it is, sir.’

> ‘Cut it up.’

> ‘I’ve cut it up, sir.’

> ‘What do you see there?’

> ‘These quite tiny seeds, sir.’

> ‘Now, take one of them and cut it up.’

> ‘I’ve cut one up, sir.’

> ‘What do you see there?’

> ‘Nothing, sir.’

The question that arises here is: does ‘nothing’ refer to the doctrine of emptiness \(*śūnyatā*\), a celebrated Buddhist teaching that seems to state the exact opposite of what we read about the fullness of brahman in some Upaniṣads and throughout the Vedānta or ‘end of the Veda’?

The context provides the answer. Chāndogya Upaniṣad 6.8–16 consists of nine short sections in which Uddālaka Āruṇi instructs his son Śvetaketu. Each section gives a different answer and ends with the same phrase: ‘That which is this finest minuteness, that the whole world has as its self. That is the truth. That is the self. In that way you are \(*tat tvam asi*\)’.

It is difficult to tell whether the ‘nothing’ of 6.12, the fifth of these nine sections, displays a whiff of Buddhist influence or emerged from Uddālaka’s brain or somewhere else, but it is obvious that he did not treat that nothing as anything special.
