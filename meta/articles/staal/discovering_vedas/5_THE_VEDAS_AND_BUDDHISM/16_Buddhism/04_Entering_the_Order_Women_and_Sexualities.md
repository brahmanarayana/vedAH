title = "04 Entering the Order, Women and Sexualities"

Buddhism consists of three parts: Buddha, Dharma and Sangha. We have touched upon the former two but it is the Sangha or Order that exhibits the most important differences between Buddhism and the Vedas. Institutionalization like that of the Buddhist Sangha existed already in Jainism. But Jainism remained isolated and conservative and never seems to have posed a challenge to Vedic Indians. The Rigveda describes wandering sages, but they do not seem to belong to sectarian groups and the Vedic nomads were wandering anyway.

We have read what the Buddha taught: ‘the highest achievement of sacrifice is to enter the order.’ Leaving society to enter the Order and become a monk is subject to numerous monastic rules and engaged in a plethora of additional rites, and is concerned, like the Vedas, with ritual *orthopraxy* or ‘correct practice.’ Buddhism insisted, in addition, on *orthodoxy* or ‘correct opinion,’ in the first place for monks and for laymen to a limited extent. The Mahāyāna challenged the distinction between monks and laymen. Other monks chose isolation after ordination and retired to the forest. They are still found in Myanmar and Thailand.

The Buddha’s teachings address all living beings but the large majority of Buddhist monks were converted from the three higher classes which, at the end of the Vedic period, were beginning to be defined. One innovation was that birth could be followed by a second birth, the initiation of *upanayana* that culminated in the Gāyatrī mantra as we have seen in Chapter 11. Entering the Sangha is also a second birth and becoming a monk was marked by the *upasampadā* ritual, in many respects similar to *upanayana* and certainly inspired by it.

What about women? They were subservient to fathers, husbands and sons, ties they could break if they entered the order. The *upasampadā* could have been adapted as the *upanayana* had been. Just as Vedic women could wear ‘the upper garment in the manner of the sacred thread’, nuns could have adapted the monk’s robe to their needs. But that is not what happened.

Tradition has it that the Buddha allowed only men to become monks, but that his favourite pupil, Ānanda, pleaded for the admission of women. The Buddha told him that, if he were to permit it, the Sangha would last five hundred years instead of a thousand. Even so, he consented and admitted women as nuns, provided they would be kept separate from the monks. His prediction turned out to have been wrong—Buddhism has lasted for two-and-a-half millennia, though women have again been excluded from ordination in Theravāda countries.

In Buddhism, eligibility does not depend on class or caste. Handbooks of monastic discipline exclude only one category of humans from entering the order. They are *paṇḍaka*s, often translated as ‘eunuch’ but, in fact, transvestites and/or passive homosexuals. One of the stories about them describes a *pa*ṇḍ*aka*, just admitted to the order, who went up to a group of young monks and asked them to make love to him. They said: ‘Away with you, *pa*ṇḍ*aka*, we don’t want you\!’ Thereupon, he approached a group of older monks who gave the same answer. Finally, turning to the elephant keepers, he was satisfied.

The reason for the exclusion of *pa*ṇḍ*aka*s has nothing to do with the murky reasonings that have recently re-emerged from the Vatican, Evangelicals and others with regard to gays. It is practical. It is not easy to decide whether the *pa*ṇḍ*aka*s must be regarded as male or female and the difficulty arises where they should be housed: in monasteries or nunnaries newly to be established? Also, would laymen provide the funds?

Homosexuality thrives in monasteries as it does in armies. Not much is known about it in the Buddhist monasteries of India; more is known about China and a great deal about Japan, where monks were running after novices and pages as well as women. Does it reflect intrinsic differences in sexual mores between India, China and Japan? I believe it reflects different periods of history, different sources and other differences that I have not yet been able to ferret out.
