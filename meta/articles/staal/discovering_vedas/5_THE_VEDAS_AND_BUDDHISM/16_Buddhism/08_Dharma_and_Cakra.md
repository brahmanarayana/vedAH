title = "08 Dharma and Cakra"

+++

Buddhism made use of Vedic terms and concepts not only because it was part of the current language. It also inherited and made judicious use of the spoked wheel \(*cakra*\) of early Indo-Aryans and Indo-Europeans. It accounts for the name of the Buddha’s first exposition of his doctrine as *Dharma-cakra-pravartana*, ‘the setting into motion of the wheel of Dharma’. *Pravartana* is derived from *vartana* which comes from the verbal root *v*ṛ*t*—and was used around 1380 BCE in Kikkuli’s Mitanni treatise to refer to the ‘turns’ that horses are taught to take in the course of their domestication as we have noted in Chapter 1. The wheel of the Buddhist Dharma, was set into motion by the Buddha in the Deer Park at Sarnath, outside Benares. It is depicted in Theravāda and Mahāyāna Buddhist art, beginning with Sanchi and throughout the Buddhist world. It has even been adopted by the Bonpos of Tibet but they turn it in the other direction.

*Dharma-cakra-pravartana* was another fortunate choice of Buddhists who were concerned about public relations. The entire expression consists of ideas and words with venerable Vedic antecedents and prefigurations. The eleventh verse of the puzzle-poem 1.164 in Chapter 15 sums up the Vedic evidence for the theory of *dharmacakra*. It deserves to be quoted in full:
>
> The wheel of time with its twelve spokes

> Turns around and around the sky and never ages.

> Here, O Agni, the sons stand in pairs,

> Seven hundred and twenty.

The first thing we notice is that a word for *time* takes the place of *dharma.* The original is ṛ*ta*, often interpreted as a principle that governs the Vedic universe. ‘Setting into motion,’ *pravartanam*, is expressed by a rare Vedic form of the same verbal root *v*ṛ*-*, the *intensive* which is a strong expression and uses a reduplication: *varvarti*. It was explained by the medieval commentator Sāyaṇa as *puna*ḥ *punar vartate* ‘turns again and again’. Seven hundred and twenty is two times 360 and obviously refers to the days and nights of a year of twelve months. The Vedic calendar according to Vedic astronomy was more precise: it comprised 366 days, adding one day about every sixty-four months in order to preserve the relation between ritual dates and lunar phases \(*Fourteen: Sūtra: Vedic Sciences*\).

In the Vedic instance, *dharma* is ‘time’, but it is not a single thing: there are many *dharmas*. This is expressed towards the end of the hymn by other famous lines which the reader will understand by looking at the original and a literal translation: *yajñena yajñam ayajanta devā*ḥ */ tāni dharmā*ṇ*i prathamāny asan*, ‘the gods ritualized ritual with ritual / those were the first *dharmas*.’ Here the dharmas are generally translated as ordinances or principles. There are several different ones and not a single *dharma* as in the Buddhist case \(if we exclude the *dharmas* or ‘constituents’ that occur in some Buddhist philosophies\).

The cakra occurs in Vedic not only as a wheel but also as a weapon. Rigveda 2.11.20 says of Indra: *avartayat sūryo na cakram*, ‘he hurled forth his *cakra* like the sun.’ The *avartayat* of ‘hurled forth’ is again derived from the verbal root *v*ṛ*-* of *pravartana*. In English, such a *cakra* is called a discus. It has a disk-like shape and refers to the disk of primordial resplendence which is the sun. Vishnu generally holds the weapon in his right upper hand, but in some early images it is on his left. In the art of Kashmir, Vishnu wears a turban which sometimes resembles those of early Kushan Bodhisattvas, and the right hand seems to be in *abhaya mudrā*, the gesture of fearlessness which is an artistic and iconographic borrowing from Buddhism.

A Sāmavedic Brāhmaṇa, the Pañcaviṃśa, described a *sattra* ritual which has a complex structure and is defined in terms of a large number of *stuti*s: ‘By means of this *sattra*, Prajāpati came to set in motion the whole universe.’ All these compositions are pre-Buddhist. That does not hold for all of the Mahābhārata, which refers in similar terms to the Naimiṣa forest where ‘according to the laws of an earlier creation, the wheel of *dharma* was set in motion.’ The bards may have been familiar with or inspired by Vedic or Buddhist antecedents or both.

Jainism and Buddhism contributed not only to the end of the Vedas or Vedānta, but evolved new ideas. Foremost among them are the decline of dharma through four ages \(*yuga*\) and the endlessness of *kalpa*, a term that in later Vedic meant ‘possible’, ‘practible’ or ‘ritual’. Romila Thapar has quoted colourful illustrations. One Buddhist text imagines an enormous mountain, brushed with a silk scarf every hundred years: when it is eroded, a *kalpa* has passed. An Ājīvika construct starts from a huge river, 117,649 times \(that is, seven to the sixth power\) the size of the Ganges. If every hundred years a grain of sand is removed from the river bed, that will be one *sara.* One *mahākalpa* equals 300,000 of these and 8,400,000 are needed to complete the transmigration of a soul. These calculations are based on the large numbers of Vedic mathematics. Thapar calls them ‘a fantasy on ciphers’.

Monks must have used these large numbers to spread fear and kindle the desire for Nirvāṇa. In due course, it spread beyond Buddhism to the Purāṇas, which looked not at Buddhism but sought legitimation in the Vedas whose authority they did not question though they did not know their contents. The only hope for the future became Kalkin, the tenth *avatāra* of Vishnu and a counterpart to the Maitreya Buddha.

The Vedic revival of the Gupta period \(320–500 CE; *Seven: Yajurveda*, PART V: THE VEDAS AND BUDDHISM\) affected mostly the upper classes, now castes. It also marked a revival of Buddhism and those monks who wrote Sanskrit treatises were converts from the same classes. Like Buddhism, the Guptas spread from Magadha, mirroring Vedic movements of the past, first to former Kurukṣetra and the Western Gangetic plain and later over large parts of the subcontinent, excluding only the south. The Gupta revivals included arts and sciences incorporating Vedic studies, sometimes under Buddhist patronage.
