      <description>Kāśyapa or Mahākāśyapa, whose first name was Pippali, was born in Magadha around the fifth century BCE. His name comes from kaśyapa which means ‘tortoise’ and is a non-Indo-European word. His father, Kapila, was a rich brahman, perhaps a descendant of a Vedic family of Indic origins. Kapila is a Vedic colour term referring to a brownish hue, perhaps derived from kapi or ‘monkey’. His mother’s name was Sumanādevī. He married Bhadrā Kāpilānī, a girl from Śākala but the marriage was not consummated.</description>

      <description>Questions concerning the early relations between Buddhism and the Vedas are highly controversial and can only be answered by taking a closer look at history and geography.
We also have to widen the perspective. Jainism is demonstrably older than Buddhism and did certainly exist at the time of the Upaniṣads. Jainism is generally ascribed to Mahāvīra, an older contemporary of the Buddha, but Jaina sources mention many precursors of which one, Pārśva, is historical, pushing the date back to the ninth century BCE—the time of the Yajurveda.</description>

      <description>Are we getting immersed in details, history and geography, and losing the forest for the trees? I have three general quotes to keep the reader on our track of discovery, two from modern scholars, one from Indian philosophy and a small Indic diversion to widen the perspective before we take a plunge into deeper waters.
The Rigveda went further than deriving pleasure from poetry and poetics. It presents us with a positive outlook on life that is not absent from the Sāmaveda, becomes more turbid in the Yajurveda and returns in the Upaniṣads.</description>

      <description>Buddhism consists of three parts: Buddha, Dharma and Sangha. We have touched upon the former two but it is the Sangha or Order that exhibits the most important differences between Buddhism and the Vedas. Institutionalization like that of the Buddhist Sangha existed already in Jainism. But Jainism remained isolated and conservative and never seems to have posed a challenge to Vedic Indians. The Rigveda describes wandering sages, but they do not seem to belong to sectarian groups and the Vedic nomads were wandering anyway.</description>

      <description>In spite of the special cases that have just been described, the Buddhist teaching or Dharma is open to everyone: it is public—like the Upaniṣads became eventually. The Aṇguttara Nikāya, an early Buddhist Pali text, declares: ‘Three things are hidden and not public: the wife, the mantras of Brahmans and erroneous views. Three things shine in public and are not hidden: the moon, the sun and the dharma.’ This is a magnificent piece of public relations though it did not prevent the eventual disappearance of Buddhism from India after ca.</description>

      <description>We are now ready to return to the thesis of Gananath Obeyesekhere, discussed in Chapter 10: in matters of life and death around the world, rebirth is the default option. I showed in that context that rebirth does occur in the Vedas but did not comment on Gananath’s other thesis: the Buddhist concept of rebirth is ethical unlike the Vedic varieties. I believe that is only partly true. Vedic ideas about rebirth display features that are ethical such as notions of merit and demerit.</description>

      <description>We may now turn to the more exalted level of philosophy in the Vedas and Buddhism. Both seem to accept an absolute. That applies in the Vedas primarily to the Upaniṣads and in Buddhism especially to some philosophies. The common perception is that the Upaniṣadic brahman is positive. It is described as ‘fullness’, pūrṇam, as we have seen. The corresponding Buddhist negative is expressed as ‘emptiness’ (śūnyatā). It plays an important role in Buddhism unlike the ‘nothing’ of the CU, furthest away from Buddhism in time and space, where no special attention is paid to it.</description>

      <description>Buddhism made use of Vedic terms and concepts not only because it was part of the current language. It also inherited and made judicious use of the spoked wheel (cakra) of early Indo-Aryans and Indo-Europeans. It accounts for the name of the Buddha’s first exposition of his doctrine as Dharma-cakra-pravartana, ‘the setting into motion of the wheel of Dharma’. Pravartana is derived from vartana which comes from the verbal root vṛt—and was used around 1380 BCE in Kikkuli’s Mitanni treatise to refer to the ‘turns’ that horses are taught to take in the course of their domestication as we have noted in Chapter 1.</description>

      <description>After the Vedas, Sanskrit became the language of learning with Prakrit or Prakrits as close seconds in Buddhist circles. Many traditions remained oral but after Aśoka (268–231 BCE), writing began to be used. With the development of cities, some became known for their Sanskrit learning. Most famous were Kāśī, Varāṇasī or Benares in the north and Kānchīpuram in the south. Buddha’s first sermon, the Dharma-cakra-pravartana of the previous section, took place at Sarnath, just outside Benares.</description>

      <description>The Vedas are not all of a piece and it would be unreasonable to expect a single final conclusion about them. What I can do is make a few remarks about Buddhism and the Vedas and try to place them in a wider perspective.
Vedic civilization does not offer us a founder, order or doctrine. Buddhism provides the Buddha and the Sangha, but if we look at its many schools and ramifications, it is clear that it does not offer a single doctrine either.</description>
