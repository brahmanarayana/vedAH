*EUCLID’S PROOF OF THE THEOREM OF BAUDHĀYANA*



Euclid was probably taught geometry in Athens by Plato’s pupils. He taught himself in Alexandria \(Al-Iskandarya\) where he started his own school. What follows is his proof as translated from the *Elements* by Thomas L. Heath. It may be understood by looking at the figure but is fully explicit and remains difficult. I have omitted references to axioms or earlier theorems.

Proposition 47

*In right-angled triangles the square on the side subtending the right angle is equal to the squares on the sides containing the right angle.*

Let *ABC* be a right-angled triangle having the angle *BAC* right; I say that the square on *BC* is equal to the squares on *BA, AC*.

For let there be described on *BC* the square *BDEC*, and on *BA, AC* the squares *GB, HC*; through *A* let *AL* be drawn parallel to either *BD* or *CE*, and let *AD, FC* be joined.

Then, since each of the angles *BAC, BAG* is right, it follows that with a straight line *BA*, and at the point *A* on it, the two straight lines *AC, AG* not lying on the same side make the adjacent angles equal to two right angles; therefore *CA* is in a straight line with *AG*.

For the same reason *BA* is also in a straight line with *AH.*

And, since the angle *DBC* is equal to the angle *FBA*: for each is right: let the angle *ABC* be added to each; therefore the whole angle *DBA* is equal to the whole angle *FBC*.

And, since *DB* is equal to *BC*, and *FB* to *BA*, the two sides *AB, BD* are equal to the two sides *FB, BC* respectively, and the angle *ABD* is equal to the angle *FBC*; therefore the base *AD* is equal to the base *FC*, and the triangle *ABD* is equal to the triangle *FBC*.

Now the parallelogram *BL* is double of the triangle *ABD*, for they have the same base *BD* and are in the same parallels *BD, AL*.

And the square *GB* is double of the triangle *FBC*, for they again have the same base *FB* and are in the same parallels *FB, GC*.

\[But the doubles of equals are equal to one another.\]

Therefore the parallelogram *BL* is also equal to the square *GB*.

Similarly, if *AE, BK* be joined, the parallelogram *CL* can also be proved equal to the square *HC*; therefore the whole square *BDEC* is equal to the two squares *GB, HC*.

And the square *BDEC* is described on *BC*, and the squares *GB, HC* on *BA, AC*.

Therefore the square on the side *BC* is equal to the squares on the sides *BA, AC*.

Therefore etc.

Q.E.D.
