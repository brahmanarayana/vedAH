*These notes provide background information, references and some entertainment for the interested reader and scholars. They furthermore seek to relate the Vedas to other civilizations, including the modern. I have not included references to my own publications as listed in the Bibliography since their titles speak for themselves. The notes follow the chapters and pages of the book and are attached to the beginning words or key terms of the sentence which they elucidate. To distinguish notes from pages, the symbol* \# *is used to refer to notes.*
