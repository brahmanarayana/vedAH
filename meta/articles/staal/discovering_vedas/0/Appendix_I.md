*LIU HUI’S PROOF OF THE THEOREM OF BĀUDHAYANA*



Liu Hui lived in the third century CE. His proof was given in algorithmic form and corresponds to the figure below. It starts with a rectangle of 3 by 4 \(HIGD\). The diagonal \(HG\) is 5. Draw a square on this diagonal \(GHFF\). By this ‘piling up of rectangles’ \(as the Chinese put it\), visible inspection shows that the theorem holds: 3-4-5 is not only a ‘Pythagorean triple’ of numbers but a ‘Pythagoraean triangle’ in geometry: the square on 3 is AMIH, on 4 is MBFL and on 5 is GHEF. The reader may be able to *see* this but for moderns the algebraic notation *a*2 \+ *b*2 = *c*2 is not only much easier, but it is generally applicable: to other triples of integers, to rational, real numbers, etc. But algebra did not exist in 263 CE.
