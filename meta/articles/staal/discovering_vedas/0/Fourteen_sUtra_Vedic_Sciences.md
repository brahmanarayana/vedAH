1 The only footnote in this book should be dedicated to David Pingree, in recent times the greatest scholar of the ancient sciences of Asia and the Middle East, especially mathematics and astronomy. In roughly forty-three books and 240 articles he used and edited Akkadian, Arabic, Greek, Latin, Persian and Sanskrit sources. His students came from all over the world and many are now teaching these subjects, especially in the USA and Japan. The day before he died, Pingree was informed by the current Provost Robert Zimmer of Brown University in an e-mail that they were contemplating closing down his program that was founded in 1974 by Otto Neugebauer \(*Fourteen: Sūtra: Vedic Sciences*\). If that happens, Brown will be remembered for a wanton act of destruction longer than anything else it may have achieved. In such cases, the President of the University is accountable, just as whoever is the chief of armed forces is accountable for what his army does. As for the history of Indian science, 2005 was a bad year. Professor K.V. Sharma died on 14 January at Chennai. He wrote and edited more than 100 books and 400 articles, a worthy counterpart to Pingree.
