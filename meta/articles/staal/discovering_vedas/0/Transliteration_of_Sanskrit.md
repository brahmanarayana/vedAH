Unlike English, Sanskrit is written as it is spoken; but in the Roman alphabet, diacritics have to be used. The vowels *a*, *i* and *u* are long \(ā\) or short \(*a*\), etc.; *e*, *o*, *ai* and *au* are always long. ‘Long’ lasts twice as long as ‘short’. Thus we have: *a* as in *mantra*, ā as in *father*, *i* as in *Indra*, ī as in *police*, *u* as in *Vi**u*, ū as in *pūr**am*, *ai* and *au* as in *my cow*.

Many consonants are pronounced as in English: *k*, *g*, *j*, *p*, *b* and *m*. Most of these come in two forms: unaspirate and aspirate: unaspirate *c* as in *candra* or Churchill; aspirate as in church-hill but without a pause. Dentals contrast with retroflexes where the corresponding English sounds are more or less in between. A glance at Figure 24 shows how they are produced in the mouth: the dentals *t*, *th*, *d*, *dh* and *n* by making the tip of the tongue touch the upper teeth; the retroflexes ṭ, ṭ*h*, ḍ*h* and ṇ, placed in a box, by turning the tip of the tongue or flexing it back and make it touch the palate. Thus the dental *n* in *mantra* or *candra* contrasts with the retroflex ṇ in *Viṣṇu* and *pūrṇam*. Dental *s* as in *singing* contrast in the same manner with retroflex ṣ in *Viṣṇu*. A third sibilant sounds like the ś in Ś*iva* or *Shiva* or *sheet*.

The other consonant signs are almost obvious: ṃ as in *haṃsa* or *humming*, ñ as in *jñāna* or *España*, ṇ as in *aṇga*, *ng* or Bangla Desh. The sound *h* is as in English, but ḥ, which sometimes occurs only after a vowel at the end of a word, may in South India sound like an echo: *Indra*ḥ like *Indra*ha, *Viṣṇu*ḥ like *Viṣṇu*hu.
