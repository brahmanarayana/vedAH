*These notes provide background information, references and some entertainment for the interested reader and scholars. They furthermore seek to relate the Vedas to other civilizations, including the modern. I have not included references to my own publications as listed in the Bibliography since their titles speak for themselves. The notes follow the chapters and pages of the book and are attached to the beginning words or key terms of the sentence which they elucidate. To distinguish notes from pages, the symbol* \# *is used to refer to notes.*

New York: Vintage Books—a book that rightly objected to the term but did not attest much familiarity with the subject.

The apparent complexity of diacritics is due to the arbitrary order of the letters of the ABC. It becomes easy when the sound pattern of language as discovered by Indian grammarians is understood : pp. 279–281 with Figure 24.

‘The Rigveda derives from the terminology of chariots and spokes’ : RV 1.164.11 which will be quoted on *pp.* 334–5.

‘Connections have been sought … but these pots do not provide pictorial representations … as on Greek vases’ : Williams, Dyfri. 1985. *Greek Vases*. British Museum: British Museum Press, e.g., Figure 12 which depicts a ‘Chariot Approaching Archer’ from about 1350–1300 BCE and is not unlike Figure 10 in this book.

‘The one with lion capitals from Sarnath’ and ‘It comes from the gateways of the Sanchi Stupa’ : illustrations are common. ‘Figure 10 illustrates such an occasion … from Morhana Pahar in Mirzapur’: Sparreboom 1985: 84 after Allchin. B. 1958. ‘Morhana-Pahar: A Rediscovery’. *Man* 58: 153–5.

‘I shall mention two of these languages and cultures here … Kafiri … and … Kalasha’ : Witzel 2004a: 604–15.—‘Asko Parpola found about 340 campsites …’: Parpola in Carpelan-Parpola 2001. Grierson, who initiated the Linguistic Survey of India at the beginning of the nineteenth century, regarded Kafiri as a branch of Dardic. Since Independence, the *Census of India* made great strides forwards but in 1969, a world-wide survey of *Current Trends in Linguistics*, declared in its fifth volume by mouth of Braj Kachru \(Sebeok 1969: 286\), that the final status of the Dardic family was still undecided. However, the Census report of 1961 had made it clear that ‘the Kafir and Kowar groups of speakers have their main concentration outside the Indian territory’ \(Sebeok 1969: 287, *note* 23\). The future of Kalasha is much more endangered. At the time of writing this note \(August 2007\), a journalist quotes a Kalasha woman: ‘The Taliban are motivated by George Bush’s war on terror. The boys go through a form of military training. It is brainwashing and when they finish they believe they are defending their own culture’ \(source withheld\).

‘Bolan may reflect the name of the Vedic tribe *Bhalāna*’ : it has the typical BMAC structure of ‘trisyllabic words with long middle syllable’: Lubotsky 2001, p. 305. *Ha* turning into *o* is equally common.—‘After crossing the Bolan Pass … one reaches Pirak’: \#29.—‘In the same neighbourhood lies Mehrgarh’: Jarrige, J.F. and M. Le Chevallier. 1979; ‘Excavations and Mehrgarh, Baluchistan. Their Significance in the Context of the Indo-Pakistan Borderlands’ in Taddei, M. Naples: 463–535.

‘The use of “Aryan” is a more serious matter …’ : On the Iranian see Bailey, H.W. 1959. ‘Iranian arya and daha,’ *Transactions of the Philological Society*: 71–115. Burrow, T. 1973. *The Sanskrit Language*. London: Faber and Faber, p. 390, provides quotations on *ārya* as applied to the language of the Indo-Aryans from Sāṣkhāyana Āraṇyaka 8.9 and Aitareya Āraṇyaka 3.2.5. ‘Madhav Deshpande has shown …’: Deshpande 1999.

## 08

‘The composer-priests were Āṅgirasas and Bhārgavas’ : clans of priests and composers of circles of the Rigveda discussed by Witzel 1997b: 262, 292. H.W. Bailey related the word Āṅgirasas to English *angel*.

‘These were spectacular finds …’ : Bhattacharyya, Durgamohan. 1957. ‘A Palm-Leaf Manuscript of the Paippalāda Samhitā: Announcement of a Rare Find’. *Our Heritage* 5:81–86. 1970. Paippalāda Samhitā *of the Atharvaveda. Volume Two. Edited from Original Manuscripts with Critical Notes.* Calcutta: Sanskrit College. Bhattacharyya, Dipak. 1997. *The* Paippalāda Samhitā *of the Atharvaveda. Edited from Original Manuscripts with Critical Notes.* Calcutta: Sanskrit College. *Volume Two. Edited from Original Manuscripts with Critical Notes.* Calcutta: Sanskrit College.

‘Dhātar, the arranger, is a creator … similar to the *demiurge* of the ancient Greeks’ : Plato, *Timaios*, describes how the *demiurge* fashions the world, putting everything together like an architect, not like a creator *ex nihilo,* ‘out of nothing.’

‘The principal composers of the Atharvaveda were closely related to chanters of *sāmans …’* : Stanley Insler in lectures, apparently unpublished, but see Insler 1998a. ‘An early treatise on phonetics and phonology’: Deshpande 1997 and 2002.—‘The second Kautsa was a grammarian-cum-ritualist and keenly aware of the difference between language and mantras’: there is urgent need for a book on Kautsa, the earliest rationalist thinker of India. The sources should be put together, in the original and translation, from Yāska’s *Nirukta*, one of the Vedāṇgas \(Vedic sciences, p. 261\) and from Jaimini’s commentary on the *Pūrva-Mīmā*ṃ*sā-Sūtra.* Yāska probably belongs to the fifth century BCE like Pāṇini, but the priority remains open: Cardona, George. 1976. *Pā*ṇ*ini: A Survey of Research*. The Hague: Mouton \(Indian reprint, 1980: Delhi: Motilal Banarsidas\), p. 273. Jaimini must be later than the third century BCE: second century according to Nakamura, Hajime. 1983. *A History of Early Vedānta Philosophy.* Delhi: Motilal Banarsidas, English translation, p. 400. Some of the relevant materials have been discussed in Oertel, Hanns. 1930. *Zur indischen Apologetik*. Stuttgart: 1930.

‘His thesis was that, unlike language … “mantras are without meaning”’ : On Kautsa’s thesis in general see the first section of Chapter 11, ‘The Meaninglessness of Mantras,’ *pages* 191–4 which runs parallel to the meaninglessness of ritual in Chapter 12 and corresponds to the gap between Vedic ritual \(as described in the Śrauta Sūtras\) and mythology \(as described by the Brāhmaṇas\): earliest and clearest statement by Tsuji, Naoshiro. 1952. *On the Relation between Brāhma*ṇ*as and Śrautasūtras*. Tokyo: The Toyo Bunko, in Japanese with English Summary, p. 187: ‘Brāhmaṇa-writers pursued an object different from that of Sūtrakarās. The former endeavoured to interpret the meaning of mantras and to explain the origin and mysterious significance of ritual proceedings, and in doing so they happened to give, often rather briefly or vaguely, prescriptions as to this or that action of a rite which they presupposed to be well known to the initiated. The Sūtrakarās, on the contrary, aimed at a systematic description of each Vedic ritual in its natural sequence.’ Echoed by Renou 1953: 29 and Dandekar 1982:77 \(related to Dandekar 1997:43\), already quoted in the text p. 227.

‘The second Kautsa was a revolutionary but … gave reasons for his views’ : Thite, G. U. 2004. ‘Vicissitudes of Vedic Ritual’, in Griffiths and Houben, \(eds.\), 2004: 558–9 argued that ‘What Kautsa seems to have meant is that not the mantras but rather their meaning is meaningless.’ Since it corresponds in time to the third or Sāmavedic period in the history of Vedic ritual, ‘which seems to be the decadent period,’ these rituals are impossible to perform, therefore fictitious and probably also of Sāmavedic origin. I refer to these ideas because we shall relate the meaninglessness of mantras, the meaninglessness of ritual and the Samaveda to each other in Chapters 11 and 12—without implying any decadence except in \#250.

‘The civilization of the Brāhmaṇas and Āraṇyakas or ‘Forest Books’ … illustrates at the same time that *forest* continued to be contrasted with *village*’ : Malamoud 1976 treats forests and villages, Sprokhoff 1981 and Rau 1997 villages.

‘He \(Agni\) could not cross the Sadānīrā’ : Satapatha Brāhmaṇa 1.4.1.14.

‘We have seen that the term *Brāhma*ṇ*a* is used in several senses … one of them: a Vedic composition in prose’ : Rau 1957, 1970 and 1976 examine the society that is depicted in these Brāhmaṇas. Since at least 1962, more than a hundred scholarly studies have been devoted to the society of the Brāhmaṇas and related topics, especially ritual, by Klaus Mylius. They are listed in Göhler, Lars \(ed.\), 2005. *Indische Kultur im Kontext: Rituale, Texte und Ideen aud Indien unde der Welt. Festschrift Professor Klays Mylius,* Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz: 457–473. Mylius was the most well-known Vedic and Sanskrit scholar in what was formerly known as the German Democratic Republic. It explains some Marxist phrases, easily abstracted, and would fit in the wider historical perspective of India at the time of the Brāhmaṇas as studied by Basu 1969, outdated in parts.—‘That is what brahmins always remained, in India as elsewhere’: Skilling, Peter. 2007. ‘King, Sangha, and Brahmans: Ideology, Ritual and Power in Pre-Modern Siam’ in Harris, Ian, \(ed.\), 2007. *Buddhism, Power and Political Order*.

Rigveda Brāhmaṇas: The Aitareya and Kauītaki Brāhmaṇas, Translated from the Original Sanskrit. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Oriental Series and Delhi: Motilal Banarsidas: 148, tells the somewhat confusing story: ‘The seers performed a sacrificial season on the Sarasvatī; they drove away Kavaa Ailūa from the Soma, “The child of a slave woman, a cheat, no Brahman; how has he been consecrated in our midst?” They sent him out to the desert, \(saying\) “There let thirst slay him; let him drink not the water of the Sarasvatī.” He sent away to the wilderness, afflicted by thirst, saw the “child of the waters” hymn \(RV 5.75.9\). “Forth among the gods let there be speeding for the Brahman.” Thereby he went to the dear abode of the water; him the waters welled out after; all around him Sarasvatī hastened.’—‘The same information is found in other Brāhmaṇas’: Caland, W. 1931. *Pa*ṇ*cavi*ṃ*śa Brāhma*ṇ*a: the Brāhma*ṇ*a of Twenty-Five Chapters*. Calcutta: Asiatic Society of Bengal: 25.10.1, p. 634, is more concise: ‘They \(the participants of the sattra\) undertake the consecration at the place \(*i.e.,* to the south of the place\) where the \(river\) Sarasvatī is lost \(in the sand of the desert\).’

‘The term occurs first at the end of the Vedic period’ : ‘The ascetics who have firmly determined their goal through a full knowledge of the Vedānta, have their being purified by the discipline of renunciation’ \(Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad 3.2.6, tr. Olivelle\).—‘One of the earliest of these is the philosophy of Bhāskara’: Ingalls, Daniel H.H. 1967. ‘Bhāskara the Vedāntin,’ *Philosophy East and West. A Journal of Oriental and Comparative Thought*: 61–7 says it is replete with ‘vitriolic references’ against Śaṇkara.—‘His Vedanta is called A-dvaita Vedānta because its position is “non-dual”’: the term *advaita* was coined by Yājñavalkya: Witzel 2003 in \#3.

‘This feature earned the Upaniṣads the Greek or English label “philosophy”’ : I am not referring to the Greek word ‘philosophy’ which means ‘love of wisdom’, but to the Greek tradition of public debates that took place in Plato’s academy and is generally initiated by Socrates: \#168.—‘The majority of these works … represent the perspective of the Brāhmaṇas’: Renou 1953a.

‘Though presented as such in our Vedic sources, they are not confined’ : Bronkhorst, Johannes. 1999. ‘Is there an Inner Conflict of Tradition?’ in Bronkhorst and Deshpande, p. 42.

‘She was called Vācaknavī, which means eloquent as well as loquacious’ : BĀU 3.5 and 3.8.—‘Finally, Yājñavalkya says’: we know that Yājñavalkya easily lost his temper and was especially rude to Sakalya \(whose version we do not have\) to whom he exploded: ‘What an imbecile you are to think that it \(viz., the heart\) could be founded anywhere other than ourselves’ \(BĀU 3.9.25\). A little later in the same Upaniṣad and about another topic, he exclaims: ‘If you will not tell me about such-and-such a spirit, your head will shatter apart.’ BĀU 3.9 26 continues: ‘Śakalya did not know him and his head did, indeed, shatter apart.’ It is a traditional theme; other links are discussed in Insler 1998b.

‘Sāmaśravas’, Song Fame, ‘was obviously a strapping young Sāmavedin’ : BĀU 3.1.2. There may be elements of regional rivalry here: Olivelle: xxxix, 308.—‘So you should simply say that you are Satyakāma \(‘truth loving’\) Jābāla’: CU 4.4–9; BĀU 4.1.6, 6.3.11.

‘Take my hand, Ārthabhāga; let’s discuss this in private’ : at the beginning of Plato’s dialogue *Phaedrus*, Socrates’ pupil of that name asks Socrates where he wants to sit. Socrates says \(229a\): ‘Turn this way; let us follow the Ilissus \(a small stream\) and sit down at a quiet spot’. Socrates asks Phaedrus to lead the way and Phaedrus points to a shady area with gentle breezes and ‘grass on which we may either sit or lie down’ \(found and translated with the help of J.M.

‘If this passage assimilates phonation and suspended breath’ : Minard, Armand 1956, II: 181, *note* 450a, last sentence. Minard refers to technical terms used in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad \(2.22.3–5\) but he prefers esotericisms: \#153. Later in the same volume, II: 317, *note* 864c, he attacks Renou’s declaration that there is nothing ‘voluntarily esoteric’ in India, ‘even in the Tantras’, lists a large number of statements by Renou to the contrary and happily settles on the phrase about ‘esoteric language, the supreme goal \(*fin suprème*\) of the Vedas.’

‘It is a god who is “Higher than *Brahman*” and known as “the Lord”’ : *Śvetāśvatara* 3.7, throughout Chapter 4 and occasionally elsewhere.—‘It also refers to “One Rudra who has not tolerated a second” “*Śvetāśvatara* 3.2.”’—‘These theistic tendencies came to the fore’: Hopkins 1966: 12 quotes Bhāgavata Purāṇa IV.29.47: ‘When Bhagavān, self-created, favours a person, that person lies aside thought that is thoroughly dependent on the world and on the Vedas.’ In theism, authority of the Vedas is not denied provided it does not conflict with *bhakti*; but *bhakti* is not Vedic.—‘It is hardly the same when the Bharadvājas … say to Agni’: ‘You are our dear guest\!’: RV: 6.2.7: *asi priyo no atithi*ḥ.

‘The Gītā’s juxtaposition of ritual and knowledge pays no attention’ : long Sanskrit compounds express the problem clearly provided the parts are separated and they are read \(in these examples\) from right to left: *karma-phala-tyāga* as ‘abandon \(*tyāga*\) of the fruit \(*phala*\) of activity \(*karma*\)’ and *karma-j*ṇ*āna-samuccaya* as ‘synthesis \(*sam-uc-caya*\) of knowledge \(*j*ṇ*āna*\) and activity \(*karma*\).

‘Vedic meditation is the product of a long process of *interiorization*. It started when a fire ritual, the Agnihotra, was interiorized by performing it though breathing’ : Bodewitz, H.W. 1973. *Jaiminīya Brāhma*ṇ*a I, 1–65. Translation and Commentary with a Study: Agnihotra and Prā*ṇ*āgnihotra*. Leiden: E. J. Brill. Bakker 1989 concentrates on breathing \(*prā*ṇ*a*\) as a natural philosophy of the wind in several Upaniads and related sources.—‘In the Soma ritual, there is a “mental \(*manasā*\) cup”’: these are cups for the Soma juice used in the Soma ritual but they are made of mind \(*manas*\). For *dh*ī \(‘vision’\) leading to *dhyāna* \(‘meditation’\): \#293 and Bronkhorst 1999 \#163.

‘The Sāmavedic CU begins with speculations about the *udgītha* chant’ : Olivelle 1996 translates ‘High Chant … the central element of a Sāman’ \(actually, the second: above Chapter 7, *p.* 110\). ‘OM unites Rig and Sāman as man and woman unite’: *p.* 242 with note: ‘You are the bed \(*upastara*ṇ*am asi*\)…’—‘Its foundation is “the most natural order of sound production: an opening of the mouth”’: Jakobson, Roman. 1962. ‘Why “Mama” and “Papa”?’ *Selected Writings I.* The Hague: Mouton, 538–45: p. 541. Roman Jakobson, one of the great scholars of the twentieth century, author of over 650 books and articles on linguistics, phonology, literary criticism, Slavic studies, poetics and semiotics, was not thinking of OM when he wrote: ‘the most natural order …’. Jakobson held a joint appointment at Harvard and was Institute Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology \(MIT\). When Harvard was about to appoint Nabokov as a Professor of Russian Literature, he put a stop to it by saying: ‘You don’t appoint an elephant as a Professor of Zoology.’—Are these matters relevant to the Vedas? See \#281, \#294–5.

‘With Rig stanzas this world; With Yajus formulas …’ : Praśna Upaniad 5.5.7.

‘In later sections, the CA and the BĀU draw from “the common stock of Upaniṣadic lore”’ : Olivelle 1996, *Introduction*, xxxvi and elsewhere.—‘There is an echo in the Vedanta or Brahma Sūtra which states … not *prativedam*, “one for each Veda”’: Vedānta Sūtra 3.3.55.

‘The second great contribution of the Upaniads … is insight in the nature of knowledge’ : Dumont, Louis. 1959. ‘Le renoncement dans les religions d’Inde’ \(Renunciation in the Religions of India\), *Archives de Sociologie des Religions* 7: 45–69: ‘what is striking \(about that contribution\) is its intellectualism.’\(p. 58\). Dumont has been badly translated, often misunderstood and it is not often that a sociologist comments with insight on the significance of the Upaniads. Hence I translate: ‘These ideas appeared before the caste system properly speaking had come into existence, they are a precocious product of that extraordinary post-Vedic and pre-Hindu development which ranges from the earliest Upaniads to the Bhagavad Gita, of that golden age of speculation when, discovery after discovery, all the important currents of Indian thought made their appearance.’ Dumont’s reflections were preceded by fieldwork in two areas, resulting in a small ethnography on the Tarask, a magical animal of the Tarascon of Southern France; and a large volume on a subcaste of South India: 1957. *Une sous-caste de l’Inde du sud. Organisation sociale et religion des Pramalai Kallar*. Dumont’s most famous work, 1966. *Homo Hierarchicus. Essai sur le système des castes*. Paris: Gallimard, deals with Hinduism, but refers in similar terms to the Vedas and Upaniads, \(e.g., p. 236\).

‘The Muṇḍaka distinguished explicitly between a lower and a higher knowledge’ : Muḍaka Up. 1.1.4.—‘The Advaita Vedanta thrives on it’: the two levels go by various names, e.g., *vyavahāra*, ‘ordinary communication,’ and *paramārtha*, ‘ultimate knowledge.’—‘The Platonic tradition is its European counterpart’: Murti 1963 explains the similarities between the Indian philosophy of language and the Platonic theory of ideas.—On Murti himself: Coward and Sivaraman 1977.

‘If it is true that mantras and ritual have no meaning …’ : even Alper, Harvey. P. 1989. *Understanding Mantras*. Albany: State University of New York \(SUNY\) Press, an impressive collection of articles and the most authoritative bibliography until that date, does not arrive at a clear conclusion of what mantras are. He does pay reasoned attention to a variety of views and opinions.

‘Language is a system in which everything hangs together’ : De Saussure, Ferdinand. 1915, etc. *Cours de Linguistique Générale*. Publié par Charles Bally et Albert Sechehaye. Paris: Payot. I have not found the phrase *où tout se tient* in this book but it expresses his basic insight which is tantamount to saying that language is a *synchronistic* system—a reaction against the *diachronistic* philology of his predecessors. Pāṇini also presents a *synchronistic* system but for different and erroneous reasons: he believed that Sanskrit did not change—a belief that de Saussure did not share. Beliefs however do not matter: what counts in science are the results, not what scientists say or believe about it. \(‘Newton’s Lesson’: Staal. 1993, 94. *Concepts of Science in Europe and Asia,* Chapter 1. Leiden: International Institute for Asian Studies.\)—It would not be surprising for *tout se tient* to apply to language if it applied to the universe. Evidence is mounting; but it has not been demonstrated.

‘Our problems are different. We are interested in infinite recursive structures’ : the theory behind what can and cannot be solved by computing machines. Recursion theory spans the period between Gödel, Church and Turing. Expertly and intelligibly discussed in Feferman and Feferman 2004, who take their reader by the hand, beginning with the ‘Unity of Science’ in Vienna before WWII up to the date of publication of their book, and full of telling details \(on pp. 145–6, they depict Church as a solid American citizen, just as stubborn as Tarski who was an immigrant from Poland\).—Here is an example of what infinite recursive structures are about: recursiveness leads to infinity but infinity need not be based upon recursiveness. Readers who are not used to logic, recursion theory or computer science, but familiar with numerals, will be in a position to appreciate the difference between *recursive infinite* and *non-recursive infinite* numerals. 1/3 or 0,33333 … is a *recursive infinite* numeral because the ‘0’ is followed by infinitely many ‘3’s. But pi or 3,141592920 … is a *non-recursive infinite* numeral: there are infinitely many numerals after the ‘3’ but there is no pattern: they do not repeat. We shall see \(p. 273 and \#\) that Vedic mantras and ritual incorporate recursive structures, and that the Vedas loved the infinite which was abhorred by the ancient Greeks.

Scott Moncrieff and Terence Kilmartin, New York: Random House, p. 802. There are other masters of the long sentence. The *Kādambar*ī and Thomas Mann come to mind. German and Sanskrit have other means at their disposal that the French language lacks: nominal composition. English can do it to some extent by simply putting words together as in *car engine.* The eighth century critic DaṇḌin comments on Sanskrit: ‘the frequent use of compounds gives power to its prose, it is its life force’ \(*oja‘samāsabhūyastvam etad gadasya jīvitam*\): Hock, Hans Heinrich and Pandharipande, Rajeshwari \(1978\), ‘Sanskrit in the Pre-Islamic Sociolinguistic Context of South Asia.’ *International Journal of the Sociology of Language* 16.11–25: 22.

‘Psychologists are interested in these recursions.’ : Miller, George. 1964. ‘The Psycholinguists,’ *Encounter*, 23 \(July\): 29–37 discusses three cases of recursiveness: *right-recursive, left-recursiveness* and *self-embedding*. The text does not mention the third which is exemplified by: ‘the rapidity that the hummingbird has \(is remarkable\)’. It is common and easy for every speaker of English. Few can manage the next step: ‘the rapidity that the motion that the hummingbird has has’. Everyone has trouble with: ‘the rapidity that the motion that the wing that the hummingbird has has has’. We return to self-embedding in ritual in the next chapter: p. 228 with note.

‘Many students of mantras have argued that mantras are speech acts’ : McDermott, A. C. S.. 1975. ‘Toward a Pragmatics of Mantra Recitation’, *The Journal of Indian Philosophy* 3, 3: 238–98; Wade T. Wheelock and John Taber in Alper 1989: \#193. More recently, the study of pragmatics in language has developed in various new directions. In 1993, the *Journal of Historical Pragmatics* devoted a special issue to ritual language behaviour. Gabriela Nik. Ilieva \(‘The Rgvedic Hymn as a Ritual Speech Event. About some grammatical-rhetorical features of 10.39 from a pragmatic perspective’: pp. 171–94\) discusses many of the complexities that a pragmatic study of a single hymn entails and that involve speaker- and hearer-oriented terms of address, plots, ellipses and ideological background. I do not know whether ‘ritual speech event’ as a technical term adds to conceptual clarity. What is important in the present context is to distinguish between a particular Ṛgvedic verse and a *mantra.* The former may *become* a mantra but is not or not yet a mantra. The two basic principles or meta-rules of the Śrauta Sūtras \(below, *pp.* 263–5\) that govern the relation between mantras and acts in Vedic ritual are: *ekamantrā*ṇ*i karmā*ṇ*i*, ‘each act is accompanied by one mantra’ and *mantrāntai*ḥ *karmādīn sa*ṃ*nipatayet*, ‘one should let the beginning of the acts coincide with the end of the mantras’ \(Āpastamba Śrauta Sūtra 24.1.38\). There are of course exceptions, but these two principles are, on the whole, sufficient for our purpose.

‘Unlike mantras, ritual consists of acts. I can do no more than give a rough idea’ : ‘The Syntactic study of Vedic ritual’: the chapter on ‘Ritual Structure’ in Staal, CV and Itti Ravi 1983, II: 127–35, was perhaps the first sketch of that idea but it was very incomplete. Forerunners in anthropology, sociology and religious studies include Hubert and Mauss 1899 \(pp. 224–5\); and in the sister discipline of linguistics, the Sanskrit grammarians and Chomsky, Noam 1957. *Syntactic Structures*. The Hague: Mouton, which inspired major advances in linguistics and led to new disciplines such as the cognitive sciences. In a wider context, emphasis on syntax characterizes mathematics and modern logic.—On Vedic ritual the scientific literature is immense, starting as it does with the Vedic treatises, the commentaries of Sāyaṇa \(‘The Role of the Yajurveda’: Chapter 7, *pp.* 118–121\), which are basically ritual-oriented even where the Vedas are not, and modern studies that started to flourish in the nineteenth century with Albrecht Weber \(brother of the more well-known sociologist Max\) and are now flourishing not only in India but wherever the Vedas are seriously studied. Dictionaries include Renou 1954 and more detailed: Sen, Chitrabhanu. 1978, 1982. *A Dictionary of the Vedic Rituals based on the* Ś*rauta and Gṛhya Sūtras*. Delhi: Concept Publishing Company. Many of Mylius’ articles and recensions \(\#149\) deal with Vedic ritual, e.g.: Mylius, Klaus. 2000. *Das altindische Opfer*. Wichtrach: Institut für Indologie.—Rather than talk/write/think about ritual, one should participate in or witness one, and if that is not feasible \(which in India it sometimes is\), stay in one’s armchair with Staal, CV and Itti Ravi 1983, Volume I until sleep prevails.

‘The other important component of *kalpa* are the Grhya or ‘domestic’ rites’ : Gonda 1980 called them ‘non-solemn’ because they exclude the Śrauta and are mainly the subject of the *Gṛhya Sūtras*. They belong to the home \(*gṛha*\). The Srauta Sūtras have a more scientific structure than the Gṛhya Sūtras: Chapter 14, pp. 260–65. \#263.—Gonda 1980 does not include the Pravargya which is generally looked upon as a Śrauta rite but boils down to boiling milk and is intermediate in some respects between Śrauta and Gṛhya: it is ‘essentially independent,’ sometimes ‘placed at the end’ or added later \(Gonda 1977: 519, 522, 526\).

Toward the end of that book \(p. 397\), he looked into the future: ‘The world began with the human race and will probably end without it.’ The truth of that thesis became evident in 2007 and it may now be added, that the end will be due to ourselves. Strenski 1993, 112, saw the original Levian sentence as ‘a threat to humanism’ but that was a decade and a half ago.—‘Lévi-Strauss could have made a contribution …’ because he knew that appearance and reality are not the same thing. He attributed that insight to his knowledge of geology and his familiarity with Marx. Recall that such a thesis is not metaphysical, but meta-phenomenological: like all theoretical science, it seeks true knowledge behind the phenomena \(p. 186\). It explains to some extent Lévi-Strauss’ thesis that ‘Theravāda Buddhism completed the material liberation of Marxism’ but the Theravada has to be placed in the wider context of Part V below.—‘But he was also inspired by the distinctive features that the linguist Roman Jakobson had introduced in phonology’: \#183 and \#294–5.—‘That failure is surprising since the road was paved in 1899’: Hubert and Mauss, discussed on the next page.

‘T. P. Mahadevan and I have studied such performances and not surprisingly’ : 2003 and 2005.—‘However, they reflect belief systems with which the rituals have nothing to do’. Nothing or something? Let the reader decide: we describe how a small Dakṣiṇāmūrti shrine was erected immediately to the south of the ritual enclosure and touching it. It attracted popular attention, including that of the media, and a significant amount of donations. But Dakṣiṇāmūrti was not an alien presence there. The idol belonged to one of the Nambudiri priests who used to perform Vedic rituals in his home in its presence. Since the image is made of wood, he brought it with him without difficulty.

‘According to Renou ‘Vedic religion is first …’ and Dandekar ‘in a similar vein …’ : Renou 1953: 29 and 16; Dandekar 1982:77. I have emphasized the essential correctness of these views but that does not imply that more traditional ideas about the relationships between myth and ritual are always invalid. They do appear in new garbs as in Jamieson 1991.—‘Robert Sharf has studied a more radical development in the Japanese Shingon ritual’: Sharf 2003.

‘Ritual exhibits another feature of recursiveness that ritual possesses and mantras in its wake: self-embedding’ : Minkowski 1989b; Brereton 1997; Witzel 1992 and above \#201. Minkowski and Brereton refer to *Darśapūr*ṇ*amāsa*, the ‘Full- and New-Moon Rituals,’ which illustrate elaborate self-embeddings \(\#202\). Modern fire rituals such as the *Pavitreṣṭi*, an *iṣṭi* for purification \(Tachikawa, Bahulkar and Kolbatkar 2001\), exhibit simpler forms such as are illustrated on pp. 234–35 \(and accompanying \#\#\). Such structures have also been adopted in the study of the Shingon Tantric Fire Ritual of Japan by Payne 1989, 1997, 1999 and in that of the Roman Catholic Mass by Jucker 2006.

‘The advantage of the term ‘self-embedding … embeds the work of Vedicists’ : see, e.g., Kadvany, John. 2008. ‘Positional notation and linguistic recursion’ in Staal, \(ed.\), 2008a. Divakaran, P.P. Forthcoming.

‘When Vedic stanzas declare that the layers of grass on which offerings are made constitute a nest’ : Gonda 1985, pp. 6–7 holds forth on ‘the vital power inherent in grasses … brings the one who uses or wears them or has them ritually spread into contact with nature’s energy and vitality, transfers it to him, makes him participate in it, purifies, wards off evil, or makes a place, a rite or other event auspicious. These phrases are followed by almost 250 pages of references and translations from the entire corpus of the Veda.—The Buddha \(Chapter 16\) also wanted to sit on grass: the grasscutter Svastika \(called after *su-asti*, ‘it is good,’ and not a forerunner of Nazi ideology\) handed grass to him as is often depicted in Buddhist art. It throws light on the structure of Borobudur \(Staal. 1988. *Een wijsgeer in het Oosten*, Amsterdam: Meulenhoff: 30 with illustrations: see below Chapter 16: 327–9 with Figures 25 and 26.\)

‘A final word about the terms ‘ritual’ and ‘sacrifice. I have proposed to distinguish’ : the brief discussion that follows is not a quibble about words but is intended to assist the reader. The term ‘sacrifice’ has ethical and monotheistic overtones that should be avoided in the study of Vedic ritual because they are misleading. The OED distinguished its meanings very well: it lists first ‘the ritual killing of an animal or person,’ turns in 3 to *Theol.* a ‘the Crucifixion as Christ’s offering of himself in propitiation for human redemption’, followed in b by the Eucharist, is then forced to take refuge in longer paraphrases and ends with chess, baseball and bridge.

Seidenberg could not take into account that the term *i*ṣṭ*ṭ akā* is not Indo-Iranian or Indo-European because I, who had mentioned it to Seidenberg, did not know it: it comes from the BMAC as we have just seen \(*p.* 267\). More recently, Seidenberg’s thesis has been discussed in Koetsier, Teun and Luc Bergmans. 2005. *Mathematics and the Divine: A Historical Study*. New York: Elsevier.

‘A natural end might consist in the story of what happened to the Vedas after the Vedas’ : Renou 1960b did provide such a survey though ‘he could not have mentioned more recent events’ \(p. 304\).—‘Much is now known about the arrival of Vedism in South India’: Mahadevan, T.P. Forthcoming.

‘He hardly explained ‘final redaction’, but let us assume that he refers to’ : Olivelle, xxxiv: ‘The issue of authorship is complicated by the fact that some of the earliest and largest Upaniṣads—at least the BĀU, the CU and the Kauṣītaki—are anthologies of material that must have existed as independent texts before their incorporation into these Upaniads by an editor or a series of editors …. leading us to believe that the editors at least partly drew upon a common stock of episodes and teachings.’ These are the words of the leading translator and scholar of the Upaniads who was not concerned with Buddhism when he penned them down—though, a few pages later, he was: 311 with note.

‘They also explain that, in due course, Buddhism returned’ : Snellgrove and Skorupski 1980 describe the Tibetan Buddhist culture of Ladakh and Zanskar. The area is depicted on the Frontispiece in eastern Kashmir, south of the Karakoram where the Indus flows through the valley of Ladakh, and immediately north of the western Himalayas which is the valley of Zanskar. Snellgrove and Skorupski’s pioneering studies are complemented by many others, e.g., Khosla, Romi. 1979. *Buddhist Monasteries in the Western Himalaya*. Kathmandu: Ratna Pustak Mandar, which provides architectural drawings. Vedic Indians must have been in those valleys but the evidence \(e.g., Iranian influence on Vairocana, the Resplendent Buddha\) is of later date. The same holds for the Swat valley south of Chitral, between 5 and 7 on the Frontispiece which was also a Buddhist area: Stein, Aurel. 1972. *On Alexander’s Track to the Indus. Personal Narrative of Explorations on the North-west Frontier of India*. New York: Benjamin Blom. Now being destroyed.

‘In partial response to that question I shall quote Etienne Lamotte’ : Lamotte 1958: 74–5, translated from the French. The present study of Buddhism covers so vast an area and has become so specialized that it is impossible for a non-specialist to keep up with it. I have often relied on Lamotte 1944–80, 1948, 1958, 1962 especially for the history of Buddhism. Supplemented on details by publications such as Bapat 1956, we would have to go back for more than a century before we find equally comprehensive surveys such as Oldenberg 1881, now dated but only in part.

‘The Mahāyāna challenged the distinction between monks and laymen’ : the greatest lay bodhisattva was Vimalakīrti. Of his Sanskrit teaching only a few fragments have been preserved, but many translations were made into other Buddhist languages. The fifth century CE translation into Chinese by Kumārajīva became an instant success and remains one of the best sources for the understanding of the Mahāyāna. Translated by Lamotte into French, here is an example \(Lamotte 1962: 303\): ‘The ideas of pollution and purification are two. If one understands pollution, the notion of purification does not arise. Destroying every imagination \(*vikalpa*\) and the road which leads there is to penetrate the doctrine of non-duality.’ Lamotte wrote in his Preface: ‘Perhaps it scandalized the Indians … but it amused and charmed the Chinese.’—Little is known about Vimalakīrti’s life in India though his house is supposed to have been in Vaisali, north of Pāṭaliputra, modern Patna.

‘They are *paṇḌḍakas*, often translated as ‘eunuch’ but in fact’ : Faure 1998.

‘I believe it reflects different periods of history … ferret out’ : the only publication which, to the best of my knowledge, has studied the geography of homosexuality in reasonable historical detail \(*pace* Michel Foucault, Mahathir and so many others\) is due to Richard Burton \(not to be confused with the actor\): 1886. *The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night. Literal Translation from the Arabic*. Vol. X with *Terminal Essay*, 63–302, concluding on pp. 206–7: ‘There exists what I shall call a ‘Sotadic Zone,’ bounded westwards by the northern and southern shores of the Mediterranean.’ It includes, as I paraphrase freely, France, the Iberian Peninsula, Italy and Greece with the coast regions of Africa from Marocco to Egypte. Running east it narrows to Turkey, Mesopotamia, Afghanistan, Sind, the Punjab and Kashmir, and broadens again to Indo-China enfolding China, Japan and Turkistan, then the South Sea Islands and the New World. ‘Within the Sotadic Zone, the Vice is popular and endemic, held at the worst to be a mere peccadillo, whilst the races to the North and South … practice it only sporadically.’ Britain is not included because Burton was British and, at times, a civil servant. \(Whether he practiced ‘the Vice’ himself remains controversial.\)

‘Performances of large Vedic rituals were generally hidden but became public’ : several essays edited by Harris 2007 put the transition from private to public in Buddhism in a political context. Deeper connections have been explored by Shimoda 2006: 26–9 who explains how Mahākaśsyapa, ‘Great Turtle,’ could have confirmed the teachings that had until then been contained in the private memories of individual disciples by collaborative recitation \(*sa*ṃ*gīti*\). That development reflected an earlier transition from the wordless experience of the Buddha’s meditation to his verbal expression by means of language. Though the Mahāyāna was familiar with the technology of writing, many of its adherents continued to give priority to hearing a teacher’s voice. They are, therefore, worthy of the name *śrāvaka* or ‘hearer.’ The entire development should be related to the origins of writing in India. Falk, Harry. 1993. *Schrift im alten Indien.

‘Śaṇkara, to whom I referred as an Upaniṣadic philosopher, had his go at Buddhism *anusmṛteś ca*’ : *Brahmasūtra* 2.2.25.

‘It has even been adopted by the Bonpos of Tibet: Kvaerne 1981.—‘The eleventh verse of the puzzle poem 1.164 of Chapter 15’: excerpts quoted on p. 35.

‘In the Vedic instance, *dharma* is ‘time,’ but it is not a single thing: there are many *dharmas*’ : Olivelle, Patrick \(ed.\), 2004 for Dharma in Indic civilization from the Vedas onward: \#54.

‘A Sāmavedic Brāhmaṇa, the Pañcaviṃśa, described a *sattra* ritual’ : a complex ritual that may be of infinite duration.—‘Foremost among them are the decline of dharma through four ages’: Hayashi, Takao. 1995. The *Bakhshāl*ī *Manuscript. An ancient Indian mathematical treatise*. Groningen: Egbert Forsten, 109–13 discusses measures of time and provides tables.

‘The University of Nālanda is the first university in the history of mankind’ : the literature is extensive from the Chinese travellers, via Dutt 1956, van Gulik 1980: 14 ff. to Sen 2005, Chapter 8 \#340.

‘It’s the logic, stupid\!’ in Sanskrit : *ānvīk*ṣ*iky eva mūrkha*\! Ā*nvīk*ṣ*ik*ī is not Vedic but *mūrkha*, ‘fool,’ is an old Vedic and Indo-European word related to Old-Lithuanian *mulkis* \(Burrow, see above \#49: 391\). On Indian logic there is a vast literature but one pioneer may be mentioned here: the Polish Sanskritist and logician Stanislaw Schayer \(Balcerowitz and Mejor 2000\).

‘The Leiden participants who knew Sanskrit did not know’ : the literature on Buddhist mediaeval logic is vast. It includes Bhattacharya 1973 and more recent articles by the same author. The birth of the New Nyaya or *Navya-Nyāya* logic has been most recently discussed by Wada, Toshihiro. 2007 \(earlier Wada in Hino and Wada \(eds.\), 2004 and Wada \(ed.\), 2006\).—‘A third international meeting, after Leiden and Hangzhou’: *Strings 2006* deals with a theory which is said to be consistent though it is difficult to understand and there do not seem to be decisive experimental facts that support it—unlike Einstein’s *Theory of General Relativity*.

‘One reason is related to the talk I had just given: the level of mathematical knowledge’ : the language faculty, which first appeared with humans, was in due time fused with the mathematical faculty thus leading to the birth of artificial languages. Pp. 299–300 with \#\#.

‘Should one delve into the matter, starting with the universe’ : Thapar 1996, Chapter 5, provides excellent reasons for rejecting these ideas which were prominent in the Purāṇṇas \(i.e., ‘the ancient’\). \#116. The Sanskrit proverb said already: ‘something is not true just because it is ancient’ \(*purā*ṇ*am ity eva na sādhu sarvam*\). Purāṇic cosmology is expressed by the four *yugas*, beginning with Satya, the ‘Age of Truth’, and ending with the Kaliyuga, an age that is characterized by *mleccha* rulers, corrupt *brāhma*ṇ*as* and upstart *śūdras*. There are similar ideas in Theravada Buddhism, where, over the *yugas*, life-expectancy is said to drop from 30,000 to one hundred years; and in Jainism, where man’s height comes down from six miles \(including 256 ribs\) to about eighteen inches \(with 16 ribs\). I accept that these speculations should not be taken seriously, but stress on the remainder of this page that in the context of the cosmos, very large numbers make much sense.—‘Even if they were thinking of cows, there is no need’: the patron of the Agnicayana, above pp. 131–2.—‘According to recent estimates, perhaps already outdated’: Penrose, Roger. 1997, etc. *The Large, the Small and the Human Mind.* Cambridge: Cambridge University Press: p. 26.—‘Contrast the story of creation ‘: *Genesis*, Chapter 1, *Qur’ān* 7: 54, 10: 3, 11: 7, 25: 59, 32: 4, 50: 38, 57: 4.—‘But even monotheists have not failed to note’: Pascal, Blaise. 1655–59 and later, never finished. *Pensées* \(‘Thoughts’\). Many editions of which I used Paris: Garnier Fréres, 1957, 90. The original reads: *notre intelligence tient dans l’ordre des choses intelligibles le même rang que notre corps dans l’étendue de la nature*.
