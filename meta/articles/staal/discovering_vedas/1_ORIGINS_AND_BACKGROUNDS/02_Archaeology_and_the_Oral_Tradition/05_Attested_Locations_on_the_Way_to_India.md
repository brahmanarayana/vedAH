title = "05 Attested Locations on the Way to India"

+++

We are now ready for a conclusion which summarizes and recapitulates what is presently known about the origins and backgrounds of Vedic civilization insofar as it came from outside the Indic subcontinent, that is, India and Pakistan. That conclusion will put the pieces together in chronological order and fill some gaps. I shall do this with the help of the map of the Frontispiece, following the attested locations that are numbered there and indicated by arrows. The map has been placed at the beginning of the book, so that the reader can refer to it when studying the following more specialized notes.

The first thing that strikes us about this map is that it is obviously an idiotic and far-fetched idea to try to invade India from the northwest with anything like an army. The goal is the lush Indus Valley of the Punjab. The barriers are a cluster of the highest mountains on the planet: the Hindu Kush, the Pamirs, the Karakoram and the western extremities of the Himalayas. Via the Khyber one might move with camels, elephants hardly, but most horses would certainly die. Via the Bolan it is easier if one comes from western Afghanistan or is already there. Horses like grasslands as still exist in Kazakhstan, but dislike the deserts further south and certainly the mountains. There is, in this respect, a significant contrast with both west and east. In the west, horses could almost gallop from the southern Russian steppes to Greece. In the east, they easily went from Mongolia into China, avoiding the Gobi Desert. It is not even very far. From Kazakhstan to India along the tracks of the map of the frontispiece is about a thousand miles.

I call the numbered locations on the map *attested* because they are dictated by geography. The few adventurous ancestors of the speakers of Indo-Aryan *must* have trekked through the passes, passages and ‘gates’ on the east or right of the map—2, 5 and 7—because there were no other ways to go unless they were trained mountaineers. The attestations of these locations are confirmed by the itineraries of Buddhist monks coming from India or Chinese, Korean, Japanese and other pilgrims coming from the east more than a millennium later. They are also the old trade routes, including much more than the over-exposed Silk Roads that economic historians of Asia have begun to study.

The map shows that 2 and 5 were pre-Vedic, but 7 Vedic, following the directions of the arrows. The same 2, 5 and 7 were Buddhist, in either direction. Buddhist movements *mirror* Vedic movements. One might describe the entire process with the help of double arrows, not in terms of our cherished labels \(‘Vedas,’ ‘Buddhism’\), but as a continuous movement and exchange of people, ideas, rites and goods over the centuries and millennia. I have adopted single arrows pointing to India which is my topic.

When I emphasize geography, I could have used the more fashionable term ecology, but it is mostly mountains that I have in mind. They are the most unmoving features of our terrestial environment. Oceans are not, as we are painfully becoming aware. Rivers flowing through plains change their courses through human history. It does not apply to mighty rivers like the Indus that have cut steep gorges through the mountains. Humans, the most destructive species, have tried to cut gorges but have not been able to move mountains. They have been successful in destroying themselves and each other and are efficient in doing away with rivers, not only by constructing dams that are like people in not giving a damn about others, but by milking them dry for excessive irrigation. They have almost finished off the Oxus, now called the Amu-Darya, famous in Antiquity, forgotten in the Rigveda and later rediscovered by Indian Buddhists. The Oxus used to flow into the Aral Sea which has now been split into two mineral stews that unleash and spread poverty and disease.

Mountains can be moved but not by humans and it takes time. The Himalayas were pushed upward by the chunk of land that drifted across the Tethys Sea, collided with the Asian Plateau and became India. The Indus, which had been flowing directly into that sea, adapted its course and started to flow around the mountains. So did the Tsangpo/Brahmaputra, also starting from the Kailāsa region, but flowing to the east before it turned south. All of it took place during the Tertiary Age, long before India, let alone humans had arrived. But geography continues to determine our life.

We shall discuss the arrows of the Frontispiece one by one. Each of them is special and that applies to 1 which primarily points to Sintashta, 2100–1800 BCE, more than 300 miles north of the map. Perhaps it indicates the approximate movement of some Indo-European speakers in both directions: for we have seen that they might have picked up the chariot wheel from the Sintashta–Arkaim culture. We have also seen that speakers of Indo-European may already have been familiar with *cakra* and not have had to travel to Sintashta all the way. In that case we erase 1 from our map and proceed to 2–9.

The arrow 2 leads into the Tarim Basin of which the map shows the western half of Xinjiang. It is there that the earliest Tarim mummies of 2000 BCE were found. It is around the time that speakers of Indo-Iranian arrived and began to change their language into Indo-Aryan. The ‘T’ on the map of Figure 5, instead of referring to Late Tocharian, is the ‘T’ of Tarim.

At roughly the same time, speakers of Iranian, indicated by arrow 3, moved in southern directions but much further west, closer to the Caspian Sea. Their arrow is smaller and thicker, denoting the slow movements of larger numbers of people, some of them moving in the direction of 6. These easier itineraries through the steppes, inviting leisurely stops or settlements, contrast with those of the more adventurous few who went further east, following arrows 2, 4 and 5 and always on the move.

The arrow 4 has not been discussed so far. Together with arrow 5, it is of great intrinsic interest and strongly supports our general argument about the geographical origins of Indo-Aryan. Located south of the centre of Khotan, a flourishing centre of civilization at various periods of history, it is one of the points from where it is possible to reach India more or less directly. These tracks seem to have been used throughout history and could have been used by Indo-Iranians who had begun to speak Indo-Aryan. It is likely, but there is not much evidence and the reason is that none of these paths are easy to follow. One first has to cross the Kun Lun Mountains and then almost impassable areas such as the freezing and desolate Soda plains of Aksai Chin, the area of India’s China war in 1962. Another trail from Khotan goes via the Karakoram Pass, formidable at 18,290 feet. Skirting the southern extremities of the Karakoram Range, it reaches the Indus in the Valley of Ladakh after which it becomes a wide tract of land at an altitude of about 12,000 feet, easy by comparison. It does not change much between Leh, still on the map, and Mount Kailāsa, which is not. All there is left to do is cross the Himalayas and one is in India. A third possibility, going southwest from Khotan, is almost impossible because one has to cross the Karakoram Range over a pass of more than 19,000 feet next to K2, the world’s second highest mountain. The only people who did it, as far as I know, are Sir Francis Younghusband and his Balti guides. After slaughtering many Tibetans, Younghusband turned into a mystic \(which he may always have been beneath his colonial face\) and peacenik \(which he had never been\).

Arrow 5 passes Muztagh Ata and reaches the Oxus. It marks the preferred route between South and East Asia and is often referred to as the Wakhan Corridor. South of the Pamirs and north of Swat, Hunza, Gilgit and the Karakorams, it is a grey valley with a bitter wind blowing over the grasses, the only things that grow there. From there one might go straight south and cross the Indus, but I have not marked it because it was a very much worse, in fact a dreaded route, ‘where iron chains serve for bridges suspended across the void,’ as the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Sung-yün put it in 519 CE. Nowadays everything is easy, if not disrupted by wars, because of the Karakoram Highway.

Arrows 4 and 5 combined may shed light on a group of small languages and cultures of exceptional interest because they have preserved elements and structures that are as old as or older than the Vedas and may be related to them in unexplored ways. All are located in the mountains, some of them in secluded and inaccessible valleys. They are either Indo-Aryan or Indo-Iranian which, in that case, may not have split into two \(as depicted on *One: Geography of the Vedas and Their Language*\) but into three branches like this:

Either hypothesis is consistent with the emergence of Indo-Aryan in the region of arrows 4 and 5 though it must be added, if one wishes to maintain an unclouded perspective, that non-Indo-European languages may have to be included. To come to grips with any of these languages and cultures is not easy. The few researchers who knew them have called them by almost equally many different names. I have referred to them as *Kafiri*. A great deal of work should be done on those that are still spoken before it is too late.

I shall mention two of these languages and cultures here. The first is Kafiri itself, located in north-east Afghanistan, but seriously threathend. Like Lithuanian in Europe, it has retained words that have not changed their form in some 3,000 years as the comparative linguistics of Indo-European shows. Kafiri culture has priests, bards and shamans. They stress purity and their seers are half-grown boys, seemingly similar to *brahmacārin*s, ‘going with brahman’, i.e. students of the Veda before marriage. The Kafiri are different in that they tend goats during the summer months. Kafiri left traces in Vedic, e.g., the word for ‘pearl’.

The other language is Kalasha, until very recently spoken by some 3,000 people in the valleys south of Chitral which is south of arrow 5. It retained its original culture to some extent. Purity is again emphasized but women play an important part. Men and women dance, separately and together, and as transvestites. All undergo purification ceremonies. There are fire and other rituals that might shed light on the Vedas, and the opposite holds as well since ritual and purity are closely connected.

Speakers of Indo-Aryan who emerged from the deserts of Xinjiang following arrow 5 were close to the source of the Oxus which they continued to follow. They met inhabitants of, or passed through area 6, the BMAC, which flourished there between 2100 and 1900 BCE. Asko Parpola found about 340 camp-sites of people from the steppes surrounding practically all known BMAC sites and dating from the Final Bronze Age, ca. 1550–1350 BE. If they were speakers of Indo-Aryan, it shows that they could not easily enter the BMAC forts. It is roughly in that area that they were pushed in two opposite directions—7 and 9—by the Iranian Wedge coming from arrow 3. Some went east and crossed the area 7—the Khyber Pass, where the first speakers of Indo-Aryan crossed the Indus and entered India.

Arrow 8 takes us to an area we have touched briefly: the Bolan route which was the most important link between India and the regions to its west during the early periods, more so than the romanticized Khyber. Bolan is also the name of a river near Quetta in Baluchistan, marked on the map. Northwest of the Bolan lies the *Harax’aitî* river, now called Helmand. Bolan may reflect the name of the Vedic tribe *Bhalāna*, a BMAC word, which was defeated in the battle of the Ten Kings. After crossing the Bolan Pass in the southern direction, one reaches Pirak and Kachi, the earliest places in South Asia where traces of horses have been found. Pirak is remarkable for another reason. It is there that Jean-François Jarrige and other French archaeologists excavated altars that resemble early altars of Vedic ritual which are depicted in Figure 20 and described in Chapter 14. In the same neighbourhood lies Mehrgarh, a Neolithic village in the sixth millennium BCE, and a continuous settlement of population that exhibits the gradual evolution from agriculture to urbanization.

Arrow 9 refers to the speakers of Vedic who went west to reach Mitanni Syria before 1380 BCE. We started with them and they end the story I have tried to tell in Part I.
