So far we have looked at the geography and history of the Oral Tradition. We have also seen that the language of the Vedas is Indo-Aryan, a branch of the large family of Indo-European languages, which has undergone some influence of many other languages and language groups, some of them located within the subcontinent, others from other areas of Asia, including Central and South-east Asia.

Next, we should confront the Oral Tradition with the findings of archaeology. And we need to address more basic issues. We have a partly empirical question: to what extent will archaeology and the Oral Tradition be able to assist us in our search for the Vedas? And we have another that is, at least in part, theoretical in nature: what are the strengths and weaknesses of oral traditions and of archaeology? Where do they fail and how can they complement each other and come together? And what role is played by that third unspoken tradition we take for granted, the written tradition to which we as readers and writers belong ourselves?

Archaeology provides us with information on localities and dates that are often precise. Its information on civilization may be patchy and it tells us nothing about language unless it includes inscriptions that have been deciphered or languages, or parts or features of languages, that have been reconstructed. The Vedic period left no inscription because there was no writing.

Oral traditions provide us with information on localities and civilization that may be precise. Their dates may be patchy or worse. In an oral tradition, all depends on the fidelity of its transmission.

A written tradition is in these three respects like an oral tradition. But *we*, readers and writers of books, have little faith in oral traditions. That is our natural and professional opinion, a modern predicament that recent communication technologies have not yet sufficiently challenged. In so far as it derives from ignorance of oral traditions, our opinion is based on prejudice. That prejudice explains the persistent search for ancient scripts. This results in our failing to pay attention to two well-known facts: writing appeared very late in the development of human language; and even at present, the large majority of languages spoken on our planet have never and may never be written down. The reader, then, should keep in mind that we will not be able to understand the Veda unless we understand the strength and reliability of which an oral tradition is capable.

The Vedic Oral Tradition was exclusively oral until its end. Inscriptions on stone or metal do not refer to it until later. Manuscripts of the Veda belong to the Common Era and are at most as reliable as the Oral Tradition on which they depend. Part of that tradition is still alive though there are uncertainties and errors in the transmission; indeed, as there have always been. There are now for the first time printed editions and handbooks, carrying their own uncertainties and errors. None of it would exist without the Oral Tradition and the extreme care with which is has been transmitted. This is a topic that we met on the cover of this book, in the preface, and shall discuss in Chapters 4 and 14, and revert to again and again throughout this book.

Is it unfortunate, then, that what the reader holds in hand is a *book*? Not necessarily for readers, author and publisher; all of them are users and perhaps even lovers of books. But there are diversities of reliability and we should return once more to the archaeology of the Indus Civilization.
