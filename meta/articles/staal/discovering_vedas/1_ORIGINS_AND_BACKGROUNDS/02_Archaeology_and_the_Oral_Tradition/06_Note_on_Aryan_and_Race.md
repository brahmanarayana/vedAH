We cannot conclude Part I without a word about the linguists’ unfortunate but continued use of the term *Aryan*. ‘Indic’ would do just as well. I sometimes use ‘Indian,’ which parallels ‘Iranian’ and is still very common in these studies. There is some justification for that usage in cultural contexts, though it is odd in terms of modern boundaries since much of the area of the Indus Civilization and where the Rigveda was composed overlap with Pakistan.

The use of ‘Aryan’ is a more serious matter that transcends the frontiers of nations and affects all of humanity. I wish I could simply have dropped it, but it would be confusing to the reader who might come across it elsewhere. Perhaps a Vedic workshop, now a flourishing and trend-setting event, will appoint a committee to look into the matter. While the committee does its work, the term should be avoided as much as possible.

In Vedic or Sanskrit, the distinction between *arya* or *ārya* and *anārya* has never been a racial or ethnic distinction. Madhav Deshpande has shown that it expresses claims to moral, social and spiritual status, tending towards exclusion in so-called ‘Hindu’ legal texts and epics, but inclusion and transformation among Jainas and Buddhists. Even at the time of the Rigveda, when many clans and tribes where fighting with each other, terms that refer to enemies such as *dasyu* or *dāsa*, which also means ‘slave’, lack racial overtones. Skin colour attracts or repels humans but who would have related it to race, a modern concept that is only at present beginning to acquire a scientific meaning?
