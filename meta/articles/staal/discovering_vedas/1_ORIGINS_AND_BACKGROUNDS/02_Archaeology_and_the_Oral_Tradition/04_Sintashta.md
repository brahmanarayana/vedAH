Where do we find the origins of the spoke-wheeled chariot? In Central Asia, the earliest known excavations take us to its northern rim: the Sintashta–Arkaim culture which flourished between approximately 2100 and 1800 BCE. It was situated near the source of the Ural River, southeast of the Ural Mountains and northeast of the Caspian Sea. It is, or was, a border zone between the forest and the treeless steppe. Some twenty-five years ago, Russian archaeologists started excavating grave sites there of tribal chiefs who were buried together with their weapons, horses and two-wheeled chariots. The most widely discussed site is illustrated in Figure 13. The numbers 1 to 3 denote ceramics and a halter, number 4 is a knife, number 5 and number 6 are arrow and spearheads. The horse and human skulls are close to each other and the wheels, which had spokes, stood upright in small trenches as is shown on the left and below, indicated by the Russian letters Z and E. Dimensions are given in centimetres.

It is often taken for granted that the language of the Sintashta–Arkaim people was Indo-European; but there is no evidence and the leap from archaeology to language is not that easy. All we have to assume is that speakers of Indo-European, who may already have possessed horses, learned about chariots with spoked wheels here or in this neighbourhood before 1800 BCE.

It is possible that they knew about similar chariots already because there is a similar grave excavated far to the west that falls within the same period and has more precise dates. It comes from Krivoe Ozero which is north of Odessa on the Black Sea and has calibrated midpoints between 2032 and 1990 BCE. Perhaps speakers of Indo-European who came from there did not have to travel to the Sintashta–Arkaim region. Future discoveries or present ones about which I do not know may tell us more. In our present context we do not need it: we know from where north or northwest of Central Asia the spoked chariots came.
