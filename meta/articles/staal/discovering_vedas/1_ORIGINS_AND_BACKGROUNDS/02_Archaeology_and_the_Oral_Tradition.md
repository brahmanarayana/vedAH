### Diversities of Reliability

So far we have looked at the geography and history of the Oral Tradition. We have also seen that the language of the Vedas is Indo-Aryan, a branch of the large family of Indo-European languages, which has undergone some influence of many other languages and language groups, some of them located within the subcontinent, others from other areas of Asia, including Central and South-east Asia.

Next, we should confront the Oral Tradition with the findings of archaeology. And we need to address more basic issues. We have a partly empirical question: to what extent will archaeology and the Oral Tradition be able to assist us in our search for the Vedas? And we have another that is, at least in part, theoretical in nature: what are the strengths and weaknesses of oral traditions and of archaeology? Where do they fail and how can they complement each other and come together? And what role is played by that third unspoken tradition we take for granted, the written tradition to which we as readers and writers belong ourselves?

Archaeology provides us with information on localities and dates that are often precise. Its information on civilization may be patchy and it tells us nothing about language unless it includes inscriptions that have been deciphered or languages, or parts or features of languages, that have been reconstructed. The Vedic period left no inscription because there was no writing.

Oral traditions provide us with information on localities and civilization that may be precise. Their dates may be patchy or worse. In an oral tradition, all depends on the fidelity of its transmission.

A written tradition is in these three respects like an oral tradition. But *we*, readers and writers of books, have little faith in oral traditions. That is our natural and professional opinion, a modern predicament that recent communication technologies have not yet sufficiently challenged. In so far as it derives from ignorance of oral traditions, our opinion is based on prejudice. That prejudice explains the persistent search for ancient scripts. This results in our failing to pay attention to two well-known facts: writing appeared very late in the development of human language; and even at present, the large majority of languages spoken on our planet have never and may never be written down. The reader, then, should keep in mind that we will not be able to understand the Veda unless we understand the strength and reliability of which an oral tradition is capable.

The Vedic Oral Tradition was exclusively oral until its end. Inscriptions on stone or metal do not refer to it until later. Manuscripts of the Veda belong to the Common Era and are at most as reliable as the Oral Tradition on which they depend. Part of that tradition is still alive though there are uncertainties and errors in the transmission; indeed, as there have always been. There are now for the first time printed editions and handbooks, carrying their own uncertainties and errors. None of it would exist without the Oral Tradition and the extreme care with which is has been transmitted. This is a topic that we met on the cover of this book, in the preface, and shall discuss in Chapters 4 and 14, and revert to again and again throughout this book.

Is it unfortunate, then, that what the reader holds in hand is a *book*? Not necessarily for readers, author and publisher; all of them are users and perhaps even lovers of books. But there are diversities of reliability and we should return once more to the archaeology of the Indus Civilization.



### Carts, Chariots and the Mind

Figure 7 illustrates small models of toy carts, excavated at Harappa sites and dating from from 2100 to 1600 BCE. The first fourteen are made of terracotta, the last three are bronze. One shows draught animals \(cattle\) and all have solid wheels. Items number 13 and 14 do not show that there were wagons with four wheels as had been originally assumed \(by Mackay and Wheeler\). Figure 8 shows wheels from the side. They are all terracotta and belong to the period from 2600 to 1900 BCE. Some are painted in black and number 15, of which only a small part survives, is painted on both sides. All these wagons that were pulled by cattle show the only type of wagon with which the Indus Civilization was familiar. Similar carts were found in the Near East during the same period, but it is now assumed \(by Kenoyer and others\) that the Harappan development was autochthonous.

The Rigveda provides us with a different picture. Its chariots \(*ratha*\) are pulled by horses and have wheels \(*cakra*\) with spokes \(*ara*\): 4, 6, 8, 12 or more. The term *cakra* is a well known Indo-European word: it is related to Greek *kuklos* from which comes English *cycle,* Latin *circus*, Anglo-Saxon *hveohl* and English *wheel*. It is combined not only with numerals but with words such as *kāla* ‘time’ in *kālacakra*, a powerful ritual; with *Vi*ṣṇ*u* in *Vi*ṣṇ*ucakra*, referring to the god’s wheel or disk; with *dharma* in *dharmacakra*, the wheel of *dharma*, etc. It is often combined with forms of the verbal root *v*ṛ*t*-‘turn’, ‘revolve’, ‘set into motion’. Compare Kikkuli’s *vartana* and Latin *vertere*, German *werden*, English—*ward* in ‘toward’, ‘outward’, etc. Vedic has related nouns such as *pravartana* and *parivartana*, ‘turning’ and ‘setting into motion,’ *dharmacakra* ‘the wheel of dharma’ \(Chapter 16\) and *cakravartin* ‘turner of the wheel’ = ‘ruler’. It will not surprise us that the Rigveda possesses in addition a detailed technical vocabulary with terms for ‘felloe’ \(*nemi*\), ‘rim’ \(*pavi*\), ‘nave’ \(*nābhi*\), ‘linch-pin’ \(āṇ*i*\), ‘hollow aperture’ \(*kha*\), and so on.

The Vedas are, of course, familiar with the distinction between the old cart \(*śaka*ṭ*a*\) with solid wheels, used for transporting goods, and the new chariot or *ratha* with wheels with spokes, used for fast movement. And yet, the term *śaka*ṭ*a*, in its feminine form *śaka*ṭī, occurs once in the Rigveda \(RV 10.146\) where a traveller is lost in a forest. He is alone and frightened. He imagines familiar sounds and sights that are not there: someone calling his cow, someone cutting wood, someone crying out, ‘You think you see cows grazing; you think you see a house; you think a cart \(*śaka*ṭī\) is rumbling’ \(translation Doniger\).

The poets of the Rigveda have an obvious preference for the term *ratha* which refers to the more fashionable and recent discovery. Their coveted knowledge of its difficult construction earned them respect and high prestige. It enabled members of the clan to win the chariot race. They use the term even to refer to an old cart. All of this and more seems to play a role in the fantastic story of Mudgala \(RV 10.102\), an old sage who hopes to win a chariot race but only owns an old wagon. He asks Indra to transform his faulty old cart into a chariot. Indra needs to do a great deal more to complete this magical transformation, but the goal is reached: Mudgala on his old wagon, with his young and nimble wife as charioteer and pulled by the unlikely pair of a bull and a mysterious wooden club, wins the race and a thousand and one hundred cows.

The Rigveda derives from the terminology of chariots and spokes some of its most sublime puzzles: RV 1.164, in which verse 11 declares: ‘The wheel of time \(*cakra*ṃ ṛ*tasya*\) with its twelve spokes turns around and around \[in\] the sky and never ages. Here stand, O Agni, the sons in pairs, seven hundred and twenty.’ The phrase I have translated as ‘turns around and around’ is a rare mode of the verb *v*ṛ*t-* which expresses an intensive act: *varvarti*. The medieval commentator Sāyaṇa explained it correctly as: *puna*ḥ *punar vartate* ‘turns again and again.’

The Rigveda contains many riddles, some of them profound and difficult to explain. The present verse is straightforward: it refers to months, days and nights. The Vedas inherited these subdivisions of the year from Mesopotamian astronomy which also influenced China and the modern world, together with other sexagesimal subdivisions such as minutes and seconds. The riddle shows that the Rigveda did not only know chariots with spoked wheels, but that its poets had started to muse about them and explore their imagery.

The tribes who spoke Indo-Aryan imported such chariots into the subcontinent through their oral tradition that is: *through their minds*. The Rigveda provides plenty of evidence supporting such mental imports. This will give the reader further inklings of Vedic poetry and the playfulness of its poetic imagination. The terms most often used in these contexts are *manas* ‘mind’ and its declined forms such as *manasā* ‘with’ or ‘in the mind’. They will engage our attention again in later chapters.

Here are three examples of chariots in the minds of poets. In Rigveda \(RV 7.64.4\), after invoking Mitra and Varuṇa, the poet describes himself as ‘he who constructs the high seat of the chariot in his mind’ \(*manasā*\). RV 10.85, a poem that was later recited during marriage ceremonies, relates how Sūryā, daughter of the Sun \(Sūrya\), travels in a chariot made of mind \(*manas*\), whether it is to her future husband, immortality or the abode of Soma. RV 10.135 is a dialogue between a son and his dead father. The son says: ‘I did not like him looking back at his ancestors and take the evil path. I want him back.’ The father responds: ‘The new chariot without wheels, which you boy have made *manasā*, which has one draught pole and goes in all directions, standing on it you are seeing nothing.’ The father’s sarcasm has been interpreted as making little of the boy’s play though it is, in fact, concerned with imagination and reality both.

The power of the mind is applicable to the charioteer himself. RV 6.75.6 says: ‘Standing on his chariot, the excellent charioteer leads the horses wherever he wishes. Praise the power of reins: the ropes follow his mind.’ Verse 8 refers to a cart called *rathavāhana*, a movable platform on which the much lighter chariot \(*ratha*\) is transported. It could not be done across a mountain pass, but would be useful in the plains, an idea also transported by mind.

The word *manas* is often translated as ‘thought’. The uses of *manas* we have met in our Rigveda contexts point unmistakably to ‘mind’ as the correct translation. ‘Mind’ is a faculty, an inborn capacity of our species. Thoughts are passing things, like the wind.



### Indic Representations of Spoke-Wheeled Chariots

The Indus Civilization did not have a script but our information on the Vedas is lacking in another respect. The Vedas left no temples, friezes or icons as we have seen. It had ritual enclosures, but they were made of perishable materials and generally used only once. Connections have been sought between the Vedas and a type of grey-ware pottery, but these pots do not provide pictorial representations, let alone of spoke-wheeled chariots which are common, for instance, on Greek vases. The oral tradition speaks loud and clear, but for visual representations we must wait for the Buddhist era, after the Vedic period.

It begins with the columns or pillars erected by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka who reigned from 268 to 231 BCE. The one with lion-capitals from Sarnath, where the Buddha first turned the *dharmacakra*, ‘the wheel of Dharma’, display wheels with spokes and there was originally another large *cakra* on top. Solid enough reasons for it to have become the emblem of modern India. Figure 9 is more specific. It comes from one of the gateways of the Sanchi Stupa and dates from the early first century BCE. It depicts a horse chariot’s procession with clear details, some we have discussed and others we have not: for example, the tying up of the tail of the horse to a strap connected with the neckstrap which is found elsewhere in Sanchi as well. The chariot that is depicted here is used ceremonially, not for hunting or fighting as was frequently depicted in the Near East and Egypt. Ideas behind representations like these are transmitted orally which is likely to have continued during later periods even when writing had become common.

Figure 10 illustrates a hold-up and may be even earlier than Sanchi: it is a rock painting from Morhana Pahar in Mirzapur, dated to the last centuries BCE. It provides again a wealth of detail. The picture on top is taken, more or less, from above. It shows how the draught pole is connected with the yoke and how the reins run separately to the heads of four horses. The axle is at the end of the chariot box and there are six spokes. The traveller is met by two armed men: one who is about to shoot an arrow and the other who stands ready with club and shield. The picture below is taken more or less from the side and is more sketchy.

After these early representations, spoked wheels become abundant in Indic art. A famous example is illustrated in Figure 11: a wheel of the Sun Temple at Konarak, built by Narasimha Deva of the Ganga dynasty between ca. 1238 and 1264. It depicts erotic positions that have to be imagined on this illustration but are said to be common in the Sun’s celestial realm. Some have been provided with Tantric interpretations.

India has preserved the chariot with spoked wheels for almost three millennia. Spoked wheels survive on bi-cycles \(*dvi-cakra*\) and rickshaws. But the even older carts with solid wheels from Harappa and other pre-Vedic civilizations have never died out. They are represented on stone temples \(at Hampi, for example\) and Figure 12 depicts a wooden procession cart from the temple at Kumbakonam. It is called *ratham*.



### Sintashta

Where do we find the origins of the spoke-wheeled chariot? In Central Asia, the earliest known excavations take us to its northern rim: the Sintashta–Arkaim culture which flourished between approximately 2100 and 1800 BCE. It was situated near the source of the Ural River, southeast of the Ural Mountains and northeast of the Caspian Sea. It is, or was, a border zone between the forest and the treeless steppe. Some twenty-five years ago, Russian archaeologists started excavating grave sites there of tribal chiefs who were buried together with their weapons, horses and two-wheeled chariots. The most widely discussed site is illustrated in Figure 13. The numbers 1 to 3 denote ceramics and a halter, number 4 is a knife, number 5 and number 6 are arrow and spearheads. The horse and human skulls are close to each other and the wheels, which had spokes, stood upright in small trenches as is shown on the left and below, indicated by the Russian letters Z and E. Dimensions are given in centimetres.

It is often taken for granted that the language of the Sintashta–Arkaim people was Indo-European; but there is no evidence and the leap from archaeology to language is not that easy. All we have to assume is that speakers of Indo-European, who may already have possessed horses, learned about chariots with spoked wheels here or in this neighbourhood before 1800 BCE.

It is possible that they knew about similar chariots already because there is a similar grave excavated far to the west that falls within the same period and has more precise dates. It comes from Krivoe Ozero which is north of Odessa on the Black Sea and has calibrated midpoints between 2032 and 1990 BCE. Perhaps speakers of Indo-European who came from there did not have to travel to the Sintashta–Arkaim region. Future discoveries or present ones about which I do not know may tell us more. In our present context we do not need it: we know from where north or northwest of Central Asia the spoked chariots came.



### Attested Locations on the Way to India

We are now ready for a conclusion which summarizes and recapitulates what is presently known about the origins and backgrounds of Vedic civilization insofar as it came from outside the Indic subcontinent, that is, India and Pakistan. That conclusion will put the pieces together in chronological order and fill some gaps. I shall do this with the help of the map of the Frontispiece, following the attested locations that are numbered there and indicated by arrows. The map has been placed at the beginning of the book, so that the reader can refer to it when studying the following more specialized notes.

The first thing that strikes us about this map is that it is obviously an idiotic and far-fetched idea to try to invade India from the northwest with anything like an army. The goal is the lush Indus Valley of the Punjab. The barriers are a cluster of the highest mountains on the planet: the Hindu Kush, the Pamirs, the Karakoram and the western extremities of the Himalayas. Via the Khyber one might move with camels, elephants hardly, but most horses would certainly die. Via the Bolan it is easier if one comes from western Afghanistan or is already there. Horses like grasslands as still exist in Kazakhstan, but dislike the deserts further south and certainly the mountains. There is, in this respect, a significant contrast with both west and east. In the west, horses could almost gallop from the southern Russian steppes to Greece. In the east, they easily went from Mongolia into China, avoiding the Gobi Desert. It is not even very far. From Kazakhstan to India along the tracks of the map of the frontispiece is about a thousand miles.

I call the numbered locations on the map *attested* because they are dictated by geography. The few adventurous ancestors of the speakers of Indo-Aryan *must* have trekked through the passes, passages and ‘gates’ on the east or right of the map—2, 5 and 7—because there were no other ways to go unless they were trained mountaineers. The attestations of these locations are confirmed by the itineraries of Buddhist monks coming from India or Chinese, Korean, Japanese and other pilgrims coming from the east more than a millennium later. They are also the old trade routes, including much more than the over-exposed Silk Roads that economic historians of Asia have begun to study.

The map shows that 2 and 5 were pre-Vedic, but 7 Vedic, following the directions of the arrows. The same 2, 5 and 7 were Buddhist, in either direction. Buddhist movements *mirror* Vedic movements. One might describe the entire process with the help of double arrows, not in terms of our cherished labels \(‘Vedas,’ ‘Buddhism’\), but as a continuous movement and exchange of people, ideas, rites and goods over the centuries and millennia. I have adopted single arrows pointing to India which is my topic.

When I emphasize geography, I could have used the more fashionable term ecology, but it is mostly mountains that I have in mind. They are the most unmoving features of our terrestial environment. Oceans are not, as we are painfully becoming aware. Rivers flowing through plains change their courses through human history. It does not apply to mighty rivers like the Indus that have cut steep gorges through the mountains. Humans, the most destructive species, have tried to cut gorges but have not been able to move mountains. They have been successful in destroying themselves and each other and are efficient in doing away with rivers, not only by constructing dams that are like people in not giving a damn about others, but by milking them dry for excessive irrigation. They have almost finished off the Oxus, now called the Amu-Darya, famous in Antiquity, forgotten in the Rigveda and later rediscovered by Indian Buddhists. The Oxus used to flow into the Aral Sea which has now been split into two mineral stews that unleash and spread poverty and disease.

Mountains can be moved but not by humans and it takes time. The Himalayas were pushed upward by the chunk of land that drifted across the Tethys Sea, collided with the Asian Plateau and became India. The Indus, which had been flowing directly into that sea, adapted its course and started to flow around the mountains. So did the Tsangpo/Brahmaputra, also starting from the Kailāsa region, but flowing to the east before it turned south. All of it took place during the Tertiary Age, long before India, let alone humans had arrived. But geography continues to determine our life.

We shall discuss the arrows of the Frontispiece one by one. Each of them is special and that applies to 1 which primarily points to Sintashta, 2100–1800 BCE, more than 300 miles north of the map. Perhaps it indicates the approximate movement of some Indo-European speakers in both directions: for we have seen that they might have picked up the chariot wheel from the Sintashta–Arkaim culture. We have also seen that speakers of Indo-European may already have been familiar with *cakra* and not have had to travel to Sintashta all the way. In that case we erase 1 from our map and proceed to 2–9.

The arrow 2 leads into the Tarim Basin of which the map shows the western half of Xinjiang. It is there that the earliest Tarim mummies of 2000 BCE were found. It is around the time that speakers of Indo-Iranian arrived and began to change their language into Indo-Aryan. The ‘T’ on the map of Figure 5, instead of referring to Late Tocharian, is the ‘T’ of Tarim.

At roughly the same time, speakers of Iranian, indicated by arrow 3, moved in southern directions but much further west, closer to the Caspian Sea. Their arrow is smaller and thicker, denoting the slow movements of larger numbers of people, some of them moving in the direction of 6. These easier itineraries through the steppes, inviting leisurely stops or settlements, contrast with those of the more adventurous few who went further east, following arrows 2, 4 and 5 and always on the move.

The arrow 4 has not been discussed so far. Together with arrow 5, it is of great intrinsic interest and strongly supports our general argument about the geographical origins of Indo-Aryan. Located south of the centre of Khotan, a flourishing centre of civilization at various periods of history, it is one of the points from where it is possible to reach India more or less directly. These tracks seem to have been used throughout history and could have been used by Indo-Iranians who had begun to speak Indo-Aryan. It is likely, but there is not much evidence and the reason is that none of these paths are easy to follow. One first has to cross the Kun Lun Mountains and then almost impassable areas such as the freezing and desolate Soda plains of Aksai Chin, the area of India’s China war in 1962. Another trail from Khotan goes via the Karakoram Pass, formidable at 18,290 feet. Skirting the southern extremities of the Karakoram Range, it reaches the Indus in the Valley of Ladakh after which it becomes a wide tract of land at an altitude of about 12,000 feet, easy by comparison. It does not change much between Leh, still on the map, and Mount Kailāsa, which is not. All there is left to do is cross the Himalayas and one is in India. A third possibility, going southwest from Khotan, is almost impossible because one has to cross the Karakoram Range over a pass of more than 19,000 feet next to K2, the world’s second highest mountain. The only people who did it, as far as I know, are Sir Francis Younghusband and his Balti guides. After slaughtering many Tibetans, Younghusband turned into a mystic \(which he may always have been beneath his colonial face\) and peacenik \(which he had never been\).

Arrow 5 passes Muztagh Ata and reaches the Oxus. It marks the preferred route between South and East Asia and is often referred to as the Wakhan Corridor. South of the Pamirs and north of Swat, Hunza, Gilgit and the Karakorams, it is a grey valley with a bitter wind blowing over the grasses, the only things that grow there. From there one might go straight south and cross the Indus, but I have not marked it because it was a very much worse, in fact a dreaded route, ‘where iron chains serve for bridges suspended across the void,’ as the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Sung-yün put it in 519 CE. Nowadays everything is easy, if not disrupted by wars, because of the Karakoram Highway.

Arrows 4 and 5 combined may shed light on a group of small languages and cultures of exceptional interest because they have preserved elements and structures that are as old as or older than the Vedas and may be related to them in unexplored ways. All are located in the mountains, some of them in secluded and inaccessible valleys. They are either Indo-Aryan or Indo-Iranian which, in that case, may not have split into two \(as depicted on *One: Geography of the Vedas and Their Language*\) but into three branches like this:

![image](images/000008.png)

Either hypothesis is consistent with the emergence of Indo-Aryan in the region of arrows 4 and 5 though it must be added, if one wishes to maintain an unclouded perspective, that non-Indo-European languages may have to be included. To come to grips with any of these languages and cultures is not easy. The few researchers who knew them have called them by almost equally many different names. I have referred to them as *Kafiri*. A great deal of work should be done on those that are still spoken before it is too late.

I shall mention two of these languages and cultures here. The first is Kafiri itself, located in north-east Afghanistan, but seriously threathend. Like Lithuanian in Europe, it has retained words that have not changed their form in some 3,000 years as the comparative linguistics of Indo-European shows. Kafiri culture has priests, bards and shamans. They stress purity and their seers are half-grown boys, seemingly similar to *brahmacārin*s, ‘going with brahman’, i.e. students of the Veda before marriage. The Kafiri are different in that they tend goats during the summer months. Kafiri left traces in Vedic, e.g., the word for ‘pearl’.

The other language is Kalasha, until very recently spoken by some 3,000 people in the valleys south of Chitral which is south of arrow 5. It retained its original culture to some extent. Purity is again emphasized but women play an important part. Men and women dance, separately and together, and as transvestites. All undergo purification ceremonies. There are fire and other rituals that might shed light on the Vedas, and the opposite holds as well since ritual and purity are closely connected.

Speakers of Indo-Aryan who emerged from the deserts of Xinjiang following arrow 5 were close to the source of the Oxus which they continued to follow. They met inhabitants of, or passed through area 6, the BMAC, which flourished there between 2100 and 1900 BCE. Asko Parpola found about 340 camp-sites of people from the steppes surrounding practically all known BMAC sites and dating from the Final Bronze Age, ca. 1550–1350 BE. If they were speakers of Indo-Aryan, it shows that they could not easily enter the BMAC forts. It is roughly in that area that they were pushed in two opposite directions—7 and 9—by the Iranian Wedge coming from arrow 3. Some went east and crossed the area 7—the Khyber Pass, where the first speakers of Indo-Aryan crossed the Indus and entered India.

Arrow 8 takes us to an area we have touched briefly: the Bolan route which was the most important link between India and the regions to its west during the early periods, more so than the romanticized Khyber. Bolan is also the name of a river near Quetta in Baluchistan, marked on the map. Northwest of the Bolan lies the *Harax’aitî* river, now called Helmand. Bolan may reflect the name of the Vedic tribe *Bhalāna*, a BMAC word, which was defeated in the battle of the Ten Kings. After crossing the Bolan Pass in the southern direction, one reaches Pirak and Kachi, the earliest places in South Asia where traces of horses have been found. Pirak is remarkable for another reason. It is there that Jean-François Jarrige and other French archaeologists excavated altars that resemble early altars of Vedic ritual which are depicted in Figure 20 and described in Chapter 14. In the same neighbourhood lies Mehrgarh, a Neolithic village in the sixth millennium BCE, and a continuous settlement of population that exhibits the gradual evolution from agriculture to urbanization.

Arrow 9 refers to the speakers of Vedic who went west to reach Mitanni Syria before 1380 BCE. We started with them and they end the story I have tried to tell in Part I.



### Note on Aryan and Race

We cannot conclude Part I without a word about the linguists’ unfortunate but continued use of the term *Aryan*. ‘Indic’ would do just as well. I sometimes use ‘Indian,’ which parallels ‘Iranian’ and is still very common in these studies. There is some justification for that usage in cultural contexts, though it is odd in terms of modern boundaries since much of the area of the Indus Civilization and where the Rigveda was composed overlap with Pakistan.

The use of ‘Aryan’ is a more serious matter that transcends the frontiers of nations and affects all of humanity. I wish I could simply have dropped it, but it would be confusing to the reader who might come across it elsewhere. Perhaps a Vedic workshop, now a flourishing and trend-setting event, will appoint a committee to look into the matter. While the committee does its work, the term should be avoided as much as possible.

In Vedic or Sanskrit, the distinction between *arya* or *ārya* and *anārya* has never been a racial or ethnic distinction. Madhav Deshpande has shown that it expresses claims to moral, social and spiritual status, tending towards exclusion in so-called ‘Hindu’ legal texts and epics, but inclusion and transformation among Jainas and Buddhists. Even at the time of the Rigveda, when many clans and tribes where fighting with each other, terms that refer to enemies such as *dasyu* or *dāsa*, which also means ‘slave’, lack racial overtones. Skin colour attracts or repels humans but who would have related it to race, a modern concept that is only at present beginning to acquire a scientific meaning?
