title = "01 RIGVEDA"

+++

The Rigveda is the earliest because its language is the most archaic and because the other three Vedas presuppose, depend on, quote or refer to it. It consists of verse \(*rig-*\). Many of its invocations ask gods for long life, riches, sons, cattle and victory in battle. Other compositions tell stories or refer to myths, familiar to their audience but not known to us. They discuss sex with the same attention to detail as rites. They contain speculations about the universe and much else.

The Rigveda contains 1,028 poems called *sūkta* from *su-ukta*, literally ‘well said’. The shortest poem consists of one verse, the longest of fifty-eight. The average is ten and the total number of verses is 10,462.
