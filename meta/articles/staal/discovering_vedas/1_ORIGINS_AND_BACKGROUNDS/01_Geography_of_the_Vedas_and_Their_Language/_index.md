Yājñavalkya, a Vedic sage, taught his wife Maitreyī that after death there is no awareness of specifics and ‘that’s all there is to immortality.’ This secret teaching or *upani**ad* presents a problem, perhaps not for Maitreyī, but for us. Would it help us to discover what Yājñavalkya may have had in mind if we knew who he was, what language he spoke, where he lived and when? These are questions we can answer. Yājñavalkya was an eccentric thinker, skilled in debate. He spoke Vedic, an archaic language, fairly well understood nowadays. The name Yājñavalkya comes from *yajña,* ‘ritual’, but he was a thinker, not a ritualist. When we say he was a ‘sage’, we use a customary interpretation of Vedic *i*, literally ‘seer’. Maitreyī means ‘Friendly One’. Yājñavalkya was a native of Kośala \(part of modern Uttar Pradesh\). Together with Videha \(roughly Bihar\), that was the eastern fringe of the Vedic area and signalled, around 450 BCE, the end of the Vedic period. If we knew where, when, how and why it began, we might be ready to learn something new.

The Vedas, then, did not originate suddenly, all of a piece, like Athena emerged fully armed from the head of Zeus according to Greek mythology. This is demonstrated by the Rigveda which is not revealed by gods, but invokes them through its poets who are known by individual names we have already met in the Preface: Viśvāmitra ‘Friend of All’, Bharadvāja, ‘Bearing Strength’ and Dīrghatamas ‘Seeing Far into Darkness’. They are the *dramatis personae* behind the lines. Viśvāmitra was an irascible seer. Bharadvāja, like some contemporaries, was fond of the term ‘exciting’ \(*niśiti*\). Dīrghatamas did as his name says. The Sāmaveda chanters were masters of long breath \(*dīrgha-prā*ṇ*a*\). In the Yajurveda, their place is taken by priests/scholars and master ritualists like Baudhāyana, ‘Concerned With Insight’, a scientist who organized and clarified complex structures. All of them conveyed knowledge and insights.

We now come to some basic facts about the four Vedas.
