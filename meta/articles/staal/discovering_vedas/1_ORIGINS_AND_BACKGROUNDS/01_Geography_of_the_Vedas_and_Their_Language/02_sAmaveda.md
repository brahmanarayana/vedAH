title = "02 SĀMAVEDA"

+++

The Sāmaveda is the Rigveda set to music. Almost all its verses are taken from the Rigveda but its melodies \(*sāman*\) are older. Two of them are mentioned in the Rigveda, one called Rathantara ‘Excellent Chariot’. Others have unfamiliar names.

The Sāmaveda is larger than the Rigveda because it lists all the modifications the Rigvedic verses undergo when they are chanted or used in ritual.
