title = "03 YAJURVEDA"

+++

The Yajurveda is the Veda of ritual. Its composers are priests. The term *yajus* refers to a ritual formula. The bulk of the Yajurveda comes again from the Rigveda. These verses are referred to as *mantra*. They are accompanied by prose sections which interpret the mantras in terms of ritual, often in a muddled fashion. These sections are called *brāhmaṇa*, a term which also refers to their composers, the hermeneuticians of the day. Baudhāyana, already mentioned, sorted them out by concentrating on *ritual form*.

The Yajurveda is also larger than the Rigveda because it consists of numerous schools, often repeating each other with differences large and small. A simple count of words would not do justice to the size of either Sāmaor Yajurveda.
