+++



I shall let the Vedas speak for themselves as much as possible, making use of existing translations, always acknowledged, but sometimes changed whenever I find what I think is a better translation or a happier phrase. I am not a Vedic specialist and have especially avoided translating Rigvedic poetry. I believe this should be done by a native speaker of English or Sanskrit, which I am not.

The reader is literate by definition, but I must continue to state that the Vedas are oral compositions that have been transmitted orally. They do not consist of *texts*. The Sāmaveda, moreover, consists of melodies. It should be heard and if studied it must be, it should be done by someone who is at least in part a composer or musicologist. Other Vedic compositions are concerned with rituals about which Renou wrote: ‘One cannot grasp even the outward meaning from reading the text unless one is gifted with the rare virtuosity of a Caland.’ Fortunately, one can still hear recitations and study living Vedic rituals in India. One should be aware that not everything one sees is Vedic. In Kerala, for example, large brass lamps with wicks are better than electric bulbs but neither are Vedic. Nor are priests who study published texts of Vedic works instead of following the oral tradition \(which may be extinct where he lives\). Caland was aware that abbreviated forms of domestic rituals \(e.g., birth or marriage rites\) continue to be performed in India, but did not know that large Soma or Śrauta rituals had survived as well. I hope my book will help to determine questions of the authenticity of such performances whenever and wherever they arise.



### Gods, Composers and Metres

The Rigveda is an anthology of poems, selected from the early traditions of families and clans and then gradually expanded. The reader is already familiar with some lines and phrases quoted in preceding chapters. We must now pay attention to a few topics that are practical and somewhat technical for us though they were of great significance to the composers.

The first is of our own making: our numerical references such as ‘7.64.4’ or ‘10.135’. In the first, ‘4’ refers to a verse \(*rḳ*\) or line of a verse, ‘64’ to the poem and ‘7’ to the ‘circle’ \(*ma*ṇḍ*ala*\) of the Rigveda. If there are only two numbers as in ‘10.135,’ they refer to a circle and a poem. Recall that there are ten circles so that the first number should always be one of these. The early ‘family traditions’ are mostly of circles 2 to 7, the core of the Rigveda. Metaphysical speculations such as ‘1.164’, occur in circles 1 and 10 which contain the latest parts of the Rigveda and additions of various sorts such as 10.90.

There are 1,028 poems in the Rigveda as we have seen, but the poets and transmitters of the Veda did not think in terms of such numbers. They knew the Vedas by heart and if references were needed, they would quote the beginning words followed by *ādi*, ‘etc.’. ‘Promote the *bráhman* etc.’ would refer to the poem I quoted at the beginning of Chapter 3. The later tradition provides indices, but the early reciters needed for each poem additional information only on three points that were of equal significance to them: the deity, the composer and the metre, for example, ‘Indra, Viśvāmitra, Triṣṭubh’. We may be surprised by the attention to metre, but the Rigveda has sophisticated metres, strikingly different from the *śloka* monotony of the epics. There are about fifteen different types, each defined in terms of the number and length of its syllables. The three most common are: Triṣṭubh \(4 x 11 syllables\), Gāyatrī \(3 x 8\) and Jagatī \(4 x 12\). That the poets looked upon them with the same awe as the gods is consistent with the fact that they sometimes identified the two: the Triṣṭubh with Indra, the Gāyatrī with Agni, the Anuṣṭubh with Soma, the Virāj with Mitra and Varuṇa, and ‘Jagatī entered all.’

Vedic, like ancient Greek, Chinese or Thai, but unlike Sanskrit, possessed an accent. *Bráhman* is different from *brahmán* as we have seen. The original accent was probably a stress accent but the oral tradition often preserved it as a tonal accent, rendered differently in different parts of India. These recitations with their varieties continue to fascinate Vedic brahmans and illustrate a characteristic emphasis on *form* to which we frequently return.

Many of the riches of the Rigveda \(RV\) are now understood, but there remain unexplained words, names and phrases. To understand everything in a civilization, one might need anthropological, botanical, ethno-mycological, folkloristic, gender-oriented, geographical, historical, linguistic, literary, mythological, phenomenological, philologic, philosophic, religious, ritual, sociological, theological and other approaches. The best thing is immersion in what has now been made accessible in print and become a *text*. The anthology by Wendy Doniger remains the most accessible but covers only about a tenth of the whole. The reader who wants more and knows German, can do no better than plunge into Geldner’s translation. Renou has also translated most of the hymns in French but has put everything in a different order, emphasizing deities which may not be such a good idea. No one can find anything without the concordance published by Wilhelm Rau in the *Orientalistische Literaturzeitung*. The essential readings are listed in the ‘Readings’ on *Readings*, just before the Source notes and Bibliography where full particulars are given for every publication I have used. There is new information on almost every topic in more recent publications.

Taking my cue from the traditional recital—‘Indra, Viśvāmitra, Triṣṭubh’ on the previous page, I shall in this chapter concentrate on three deities and then provide an example of a famous speculative poem. Much is known about the former because the poets address them but they often presuppose familiarity with qualities or stories that were only known to the audience. My selection of deities is not subjective because ‘most common’ is measured in numbers. But should I follow numbers when there must be poems about the Creator God with whom we *ought* to begin?

The answer is, No. Wendy Doniger’s selection is a cultural construct due to religious prejudice in that it starts with *creation*. It is a concept that pops up automatically in the mind of a Euro-American, religiously minded or not, as well as many other speakers of English, because it is well known that the sacred books of Judaism and Christianity start with the creation myth of *Genesis*. RV 10.129, with which Wendy begins, is accordingly referred to by almost all scholars as a ‘creation hymn’ as if it were the foundation of a creed, but it is not. It simply *wonders* like the famous speculative poem that follows.

Aren’t there infinitely many gods? The number of gods in later so-called ‘Hinduism’ is infinite because that is what it is sometimes said to be. There are also various lists that seem indefinitely long. The number of Vedic gods is finite but fairly long. It is not laid down by an ‘authoritative’ poem because there are no such poems in the Rigveda. We have met with a goddess who pervades space, but several goddesses and gods are impersonal. Male gods struggle with the Asuras, a group of supernatural beings that are often referred to as demons. The Asuras may also be gods, but of a world of darkness.

The most important Vedic gods are Agni, Indra, Soma, Uṣas, Rudra, Bṛhaspati, the Aśvins and the Maruts. Viṣṇu survives as a god with more personal traits. Śiva means ‘auspicious’ in Vedic where his predecessor is Rudra. The Rigveda dedicates more than forty hymns to the *Viśve devā*ḥ or All-Gods, to make sure that none is left out.

Agni and Soma have much in common. They are impersonal divinities but concrete as well: Agni is fire and Soma refers to an invigorating juice that is extracted from the stalks of a plant. Agni and Soma are increasingly ritualized. Indra has more personal traits. He is a hero, always willing to assist in battle and fond of adventures. He is referred to as king of the gods, the function best remembered after the Vedic period and in Buddhism, for example.



## AGNI

The first poem of the Rigveda, *RV* 1.1, invokes *agni vaiśvānara*, ‘Agni who is common to all men’. It starts with: ‘I praise Agni, minister and divine priest of the ritual, who as invoker brings most treasure.’ Agni is fire and, as receiver of oblations, a link to all the gods. He is addressed in about 200 hymns and makes a brief appearance at the beginning of the final poem of the collection which is in praise of unity. It may have been especially composed to mark the successful completion of the entire corpus which, by that time, was regarded as a single gigantic composition. The poem is on the theme of unification, a theme with variations on the key word *sam-*, ‘together’:

1. You, bull Agni, take all treasures including those of able-bodied men. You will be lit on the offering altar. Bring those treasures to us\!
2. Go together, speak together, let our minds come together, like the gods of old sat together at their offering.
3. Unify the mantra, unify the meeting, let your mind and thought be unified. I recommend to you a unified mantra, I offer to you with a unified offering.
4. Unified be your intention, unified your heart. Your mind should be unified so that there is a good connection\!

A typical hymn to Agni is Rigveda 5.11:

1. Guardian of the people, vigilant, clever; Agni was born for new prosperity. Face touched with butter, he shines bright with great sky-touching flame for all the Bharatas.
2. On the triple altar, men have kindled Agni, banner of the ritual, first domestic priest. Let him ride the chariot with Indra and the gods; let him be seated on the sacred grass as a skilful invoker for the ritual.
3. Impure, you are born of your parents; bright, you came up as the joy-bringing seer of Vivasvant. With butter they made you strong, Agni, to whom the offering is made.
4. Agni … may he come at once to the ritual; Agni, whom men carry in every house; Agni became the messenger, the bringer of offerings; Agni they are choosing, shocking one with a seer’s power.
5. For you, Agni, these sweetest words; for you may this invocation be a blessing to the heart. You are the one these songs fill with power, as the great rivers fill the Indus, you are the one they make strong.
6. The Aṅgirases found you in a secret place, Agni, resting in every wood. So are you born, when stirred up with great force; you are the one they call ‘Son of Strength’, O Aṅgiras\!

Aṅgiras refers to a sage and sometimes to Agni. Agni is touched with butter, the main oblation into the fire, and rests in every wood because he is born when two pieces of wood are rubbed together.



## INDRA

Indra is invoked in all his splendour in an early hymn, translated by me largely after Doniger and with the help of Geldner, Macdonell and Renou: RV 2.12. The composer seems to be concerned that the cult of Indra is weakening:

1. The first, the wise god who from the moment he was born, surpassed the gods in power, before whose hot breath the two worlds trembled at the greatness of his manly powers—he, my people, is Indra.
2. He who made fast the tottering earth, who made still the quaking mountains, who measured out and extended the expanse of the air, who propped up the sky—he, my people, is Indra.
3. He who killed the serpent and loosed the seven rivers, who drove out the cows that had been pent up by Vala, who gave birth to fire between two stones, the winner of booty in combats—he, my people, is Indra.
4. He by whom all these changes were rung, who drove the Dāsa peoples down into obscurity, who took away the flourishing wealth of the enemy as a winning gambler takes the stake—he, my people, is Indra.
5. He about whom they ask, ‘Where is he?’, or they say of him, the terrible one, ‘He does not exist,’ he who diminishes the flourishing wealth of the enemy as a gambler does—believe in him\! He, my people, is Indra.
6. He who comforts the weary and the sick, and the poor priest who is in need, who helps the man who harnesses the stones to press Soma, he who has lips fine for drinking—he, my people, is Indra.
7. He under whose command are horses and cows and villages and all chariots, who gave birth to the sun and the dawn, the leader of the waters—he, my people, is Indra.
8. He who is invoked by both of two armies, enemies locked in combat, on this side and on that, he who is even invoked separately by two men standing on the same chariot—he, my people, is Indra.
9. He without whom people do not conquer, he whom they call on for help when they are fighting, who became a match to every opponent, who shakes the unshakeable—he, my people, is Indra.
10. He who killed with his weapon all those who had committed a great crime, even when they did not know it, he who does not pardon the arrogant for their arrogance, the slayer of the Dasyus—he, my people, is Indra.
11. He who in the fortieth autumn discovered Śambara living in the mountains, who killed the violent serpent, the Dānu as he lay there—he, my people, is Indra.
12. He the mighty bull, who with his seven reins let loose the seven rivers to flow, who with thunderbolt in his hand hurled down Rauhiṇa as he was climbing up to the sky—he, my people, is Indra.
13. Even sky and earth bow low before him, even the mountains are terrified by his hot breath. He who is known as the drinker of Soma, thunderbolt in hand, thunderbolt in his palm—he, my people, is Indra.
14. He who helps with his favour the one who presses Soma and prepares, who praises and completes, he for whom sublime language is nourishment, whose is Soma, whose is this donation—he, my people, is Indra.
15. You who eagerly grasps the price for the one who presses Soma and prepares, you are truly real. Let us be dear to you, Indra, all our days, and let us as heroes speak with wisdom.

Rauhiṇa, here a demon who attacks Indra, became a stellar constellation. Dāsa and Dasyu, terms used of enemies, servants and slaves, are generally taken to refer to indigenous tribes or clans which is likely; or to an earlier group of speakers of Indo-Aryan. Śambara has been interpreted as an Austro-Asiatic name and linked to early excavations in Bactria. He survives in Buddhist Vajrayāṇa Tantrism—or so does his name.



## SOMA

Here is a famous hymn of the tenth circle \(10.119\) as translated by George Thompson:

1. Yes, yes, this is my intention.  
   I will win the cow, the horse. Yes\!  
   Have I drunk of the Soma? Yes\!
2. Forth like raging winds  
   The drinks have lifted me up.  
   Have I drunk of the Soma? Yes\!
3. The drinks have lifted me up,  
   As swift horses lift up the chariot.  
   Have I drunk of the Soma? Yes\!
4. Inspiration has come to me,  
   Like a bellowing cow to her precious son.  
   Have I drunk of the Soma? Yes\!
5. I, as a craftsman the chariot seat,  
   I bend around in my heart this inspiration.  
   Have I drunk of the Soma? Yes\!
6. Not even a blink of the eye  
   Have the five tribes seemed to me\!  
   Have I drunk of the Soma? Yes\!
7. Neither of these two worlds to me  
   Seems equal to one of my two wings\!  
   Have I drunk of the Soma? Yes\!
8. I have overwhelmed heaven with my greatness,  
   I have overwhelmed this great earth\!  
   Have I drunk of the Soma? Yes\!
9. I myself, I myself will set down this  
   Earth, perhaps here, perhaps there.  
   Have I drunk of the Soma? Yes\!
10. Heatedly will I smash the earth.  
    I will smash it, perhaps here, perhaps there.  
    Have I drunk of the Soma? Yes\!
11. In heaven is the one of my two wings.  
    The other I have dragged down here below.  
    Have I drunk of the Soma? Yes\!
12. I myself, I am become great, great,  
    Impelled upward to the cloud\!  
    Have I drunk of the Soma? Yes\!
13. I go forth a home that is well made,  
    A vehicle of oblations to the gods\!  
    Have I drunk of the Soma? Yes\!

Soma is the juice pressed from the stalks of a plant growing in the mountains. The best Soma comes from Mount Mūjavat which Witzel located near the source of the Oxus. Soma stalks are without leaves or flowers. The term *soma* is not a name. It comes from *su-* which means to press the dry stalks or extract the juice. The entire ninth circle of the Rigveda is concerned with the preparation of the Soma. All the activities that are described there are regarded as effective only if they are accompanied by mantras. The effect of drinking is not discussed but drinking Soma often occurs in the Vedas as in 10.119, just quoted. The effect is described by forms and derivatives of *mad-* \(which has nothing to do with English ‘mad’\). It may mean delight or inspiration and refers to the heavenly bliss of gods and ancestors. In the context of Soma, it is best understood as rapture or elation.

It is clear from the Brāhmaṇas and other Vedic and post-Vedic compositions, that the original Soma was lost at an early period and substitutes were used. What was the botanical identity of the original Soma? Though some have claimed that it is unimportant to the philologist, as if the referents of words did not matter, the majority of Vedicists have been puzzled by that question. Doniger enumerates more than 140 theories, published between 1784 and 1967, not in her *Rig Veda* but in her chapter in R. Gordon Wasson’s magnificent book entitled *Soma. Divine Mushroom of Immortality*.

Wasson introduced a fresh and new approach to the study of the Rigveda that might lead to a solution of the problem. He had been a New York banker but his wife, Valentina Pavlovna, turned his attention to mushrooms. It became a hobby and, after his retirement, a vocation. He became a leading ethno-mycologist, an expert on the religious and social uses of mushrooms. With full control of the rapidly increasing information about psychoactive plants among botanists, chemists, pharmacologists and others, Wasson argued that the Vedic Soma was the fly-agaric mushroom, *Amanita muscaria*, familiar from the birch forests, alpine meadows and folklore of the cooler regions of Eurasia from Western Europe to Siberia.

The Rigveda describes Soma as emerging from the soil as a little white ball. It bursts its white garment, fragments of the envelope remaining as white patches on the red skin underneath. Those are the white spots of the fly-agaric. Wasson’s illustrations are often inspired by poetic descriptions of Soma such as ‘the hide is of bull, the dress of sheep’.

Wasson’s work was reviewed by anthropologists, botanists, mycologists and the leading Vedicists of the day: Sir Harold Bailey of Cambridge \(*see Seven: Yajurveda*\), Daniel Ingalls of Harvard \(*see Five: Rigveda*\), F.B.J. Kuiper of Leiden—all positive with qualifications—and John Brough of London \(*see Three: Civilization and Society*\), whose review was the most substantial and entirely negative. Brough writes about the poem of our *Five: Rigveda* that it could not have been composed by a poet under the influence of the Soma: ‘the artifice of its structure excludes this.’ It is true that it may not have been composed under its influence, but it certainly was composed by someone who was familiar with the effects of drinking or digesting Soma, as Thompson’s translation shows. Brough discusses the colour of the plant and objects to Wasson’s theory because the fly-agaric is, according to him, but not to Wasson, a depressant.

The next major contribution was a monograph by D.S. Flattery and Martin Schwartz. It took account of Vedic but also of hallucinogens and the Iranian evidence on Haoma, the equivalent of the Vedic Soma. Although it mentions that, in Iran, there were many *haoma*s, it defended the thesis that the original Soma/Haoma was *Peganum harmala*, the mountain rue. Since then and for no good reason, the mainstream opinion among European and Indian scholars has been that Soma was Ephedra, a mildly psycho-active plant that prevents sleeping. Like the mountain rue, ‘a common weed available from the nearest rubbish heap’ as Flattery and Schwartz describe it, Ephedra is ubiquitous and therefore an unlikely candidate because Soma was rare and grew in the high mountains as on Mount Mūjavat. Its rarity contrasts with the numerous Iranian haomas which must have been substitutes. They explain geographical and other differences between Indo-Aryan and Iranian.

No unanimous conclusion has been reached with regard to the identity of the original Soma. Those Vedic scholars who had declared that it does not matter, making a virtue of necessity, could not deny that Wasson was undoubtedly right, that the identity of the Soma plant is not a problem that Vedic scholars can solve by themselves: ‘Let the Vedists leave off feeding exclusively on the Rigveda and each other.’ I don’t believe that Soma was the fly-agaric but Wasson’s new perspective was a great step forward and his recommendation sounds to me as sane advice. A few Vedicists \(George Thompson among them\) have paid attention.

Ingalls, who sided with Wasson, observed that the Agni hymns seek for a harmony between this world and the next, but are always aware of the distinction. Soma poems are different: they concentrate on an immediate experience: ‘There is no myth, no past, no need for harmony. It is all here, all alive and one.’ Ingalls’s characterization is apt and I would only add that the Agni hymns are concerned with a beneficial but dangerous entity that must be controlled by mantras and ritual. Memories of one of man’s greatest discoveries, how to make fire, seem to reverberate in Agni. The Soma hymns are as Ingalls described them: though an entire circle dealt with the preparation of the Soma substance, they aim at ecstasy and insight. Ritual \(*karma*\) continued to dominate the Sāma- and Yajurvedas and the Brāhmaṇas. The search for insight or knowledge \(*jñāna*\) was brought to fruition in the later poems of the Rigveda and in the Upaniṣads.



### A Speculative Poem

I shall now fulfil a promise: RV 10.129 which presents itself without deity or poet. The poem belongs to the late Rigveda when the Veda reflected a great variety of ideas, cultures and sections of society. It mentions its metre: Triṣṭubh. It is not a puzzle or riddle like some other long poems of the same period, belonging to the first or the tenth circle. I would rather describe it as thinking aloud. I shall quote its most recent and reliable translation, that of 1999 by Joel Brereton, adding Wendy Doniger’s sage comment on poems that puzzle: ‘Good. They are meant to puzzle.’

1. The non-existent did not exist, nor did the existent exist at that time.  
   There existed neither the midspace nor the heaven beyond.  
   What stirred? From where and in whose protection? Did water exist, a deep depth?
2. Death did not exist nor deathlessness then.  
   There existed no sign of night nor of day.  
   That One breathed without wind through its inherent force. There existed nothing else beyond that.
3. Darkness existed, hidden by darkness, in the beginning. All this was a signless ocean.  
   When the thing coming into being was concealed by emptiness, then was the One born by the power of heat.
4. Then, in the beginning, from thought developed desire, Which existed as the primal semen.  
   Searching in their hearts through inspired thinking, Poets found the connection of the existence in the non-existent.
5. Their cord was stretched across:  
   Did something exist below it? Did something exist above?  
   There were places of semen and there were powers. There was inherent force below, offering above.
6. Who really knows? Who shall here proclaim it? From where was it born, from where this creation? The gods are on this side of the creation of this world. So then who does know from where it came to be?
7. This creation—from where it came to be,  
   If it was produced or if not—  
   He who is the overseer of this world in the highest heaven,  
   He surely knows. Or if he does not know …?

I have retained the words of the translator but would prefer to render *visarjana* as ‘emission’ and *visṛṣṭi* as ‘production’, not ‘creation’, because the latter term evokes a personal creator and verse 6 says that the gods are ‘on this side of it’. It is moreover in line with ‘produced’ in the last verse though the Sanskrit term used there is different. Geldner has ‘Schöpfung’ but Renou senses a difficulty and wonders: ‘création secondaire?’

This poem recognizes genuine problems of philosophy at a level most religious poetry does not even touch. Since it can speak for itself and speaks well, I need only add that no translation can do full justice to the sounds of the original. Brereton’s translation is ringing \(‘deep depth death—deathlessness then’, etc.\), but the original sounds can be heard only in the original. Tatiana Elizarenkova has quoted them: Negations as expressed by *na*, *a-*, *an-* supported by constant repetition of *mā*, *ma*, *am*. Existence as expressed by *as-* ‘exist’ and its conjugated forms *āsīt*, *sat*, *asat*, reflected by echoes: *tamasā*, *asya*, etc. Questions as marked by interrogative pronouns starting with *k-*: *ka* ‘who?’, *kim* ‘what?’ *kutas* ‘whence?’, *kuha* ‘where?’ The ‘polyphonic nature of the sound symbolism’, as she has called it, is not inferior to Kalidāsa or Paul Valéry.



### The Scientific Study of the Veda

In the last two chapters, we have looked at two controversies between Euro-American scholars about the Vedas. One is concerned with Vedic society, the other with the Soma. Both might seem to illustrate the irrelevance of infighting between Americans, Britons, Dutch- and Frenchmen to our august topic. But those inclined to think so would miss the point. The differences of opinion rest at least in part on categories that transcend contemporary national or political boundaries and are universal features of knowledge. Dumézil exhibits not nationalism but rationalism, Wasson combines rationalism with empiricism in another discipline, Gonda empiricism, and Brough comes closest to combining both. Of course, a good rationalist respects the facts and a good empiricist respects logic, otherwise they would not be scientists or thinkers—in any civilization.

If the rationalist Nyāya system of logic and the empiricist Vaiśeṣika—before they combined into the Nyāya–Vaiśeṣika—had paid more attention to the Vedas, they would have defended similarly different positions as Dumézil, Wasson, Gonda and Brough. The one philosophical system that is concerned with the Veda and to which I have already referred for that reason, the Mimāṃsā, combines rationalism and empiricism. Its theory of *apūrva*, offered as a causal explanation for the mechanism of karma, is rational. Its attention to Vedic *minutiae* is empirical. Although the data of the Mimāṃsā pertain exclusively to ritual, based as they are on the Śrauta Sūtras, they are concerned with facts. The Mimāṃsā may have little to say about history, but it has evolved an original theory about the facts of Vedic syntax.

Indian sciences pay attention to Vedic facts as Chapter 14 will demonstrate. The small number of Pāṇini’s rules that apply to the Vedic language are marked by the expression *chandasi*, ‘in the Veda’. They are far from exhaustive, and if omitted would not affect the system. I include Pāṇini in our discussion, though he does not belong to the Vedic period, because he would not have existed without it and adds fuel to my final observation: each of my few examples of rational and empirical approaches help to demonstrate that the Vedas have always been the subject of serious study. They are worthy of it and I hope they will remain so, that scholars and scientists will continue to pay attention to the facts, as we know them, and to rational argument in order to make sense. In these respects, the scientific study of the Rigveda and the other Vedas proceeds like any other science. We must know what the composers had in mind before we invoke the Vedas in support of a pet theory or deep conviction.

The present chapter has been concerned with some of the characteristics, including composers, subdivisions, metres and accents, invocations of gods and speculative poems of the Rigveda. I have discussed different points of view on the identity of the Soma plant and try to adjudicate between them. Has it been ‘a scientific study’ as I advocated just now? It is not because that would take more time. If we combine it with our earlier discussions pertaining to the Rigveda in Chapters 1 to 4, it may be looked upon as an introductory exploration.
