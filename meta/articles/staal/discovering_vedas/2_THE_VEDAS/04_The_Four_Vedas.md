title = "04 The Four Vedas"

+++



Yājñavalkya is said to have received his mantras directly from the Sun. This captures the notion of timelessness that is not interested in ‘early’ or ‘late’ and is blind to historical development or evolution. I shall make limited use of that synchronistic and analytical perspective because it is a helpful abstraction when using language as a writer must do: it assists our discourse because it looks upon the four Vedas as a kind of transcendental idea that had not yet descended to earth. In actual fact, we shall see that each of the Vedic schools developed in a different place and at a different period. A survey of these schools is a straightforward continuation of the maps of Figures 1 and 2. They show that the Rigveda was composed in the Indus Valley in the west and the other three Vedas originated around the upper and middle courses of the Ganges further east. A closer look reveals that ‘upper’ Ganges refers to Kuru and Pañcāla \(parts of the eastern Punjab, modern Haryana and western UP north of the Ganges\) and ‘middle’ Ganges to Kośala and Videha \(eastern UP and Bihar north of the Ganges\). If we add approximate dates we have a framework for the present chapter. If we add the Vedic compositions themselves, the four Vedas are in hand. To help capture that the next four chapters, 4 to 8, will treat each of them separately.

The reader may wonder how we can be precise about such ancient history especially when our sources are oral. Part of the answer is that the transmission of the Vedas has been remarkably accurate. The rest of it is due to the history and evolution of the Vedic language, which is now fairly well established though it tends to be ignored or neglected by most archaeologists and historians. Alas, when disciplines isolate themselves from each other, progress will soon come to an end. Languages change though not necessarily at the same pace. Just as Chaucer, Shakespeare and W.H. Auden exhibit three stages of the development of English, our tripartite division of the Indus Valley, upper Ganges \(Kuru-Pañcāla\) and middle Ganges \(Kośala and Videha\) corresponds to three stages of development of Vedic, conveniently known as Early, Middle and Late Vedic. I shall use these labels and other variables and treat the three periods one by one, trying to illustrate to what extent the Vedas were connected with each other and to what extent they were artificially put together. On Early Vedic, we can be brief since I have partly dealt with this before.



### Early Vedic

This form of Vedic was spoken in the Indus Valley, ca. 1700–1200 BCE, by families and clans, the Vedic Indians by definition, whose language was adopted by others along with their mantras partly because of the power or alleged power of the latter. We are already familiar with some of its features because it is the period of the Rigveda. It resulted in verse that described sublime language \(*bráhman* as well as *vāc*\) as all-knowing \(*viśva-vid*\), a compound derived from *viśva* and the same verbal root *vid-* ‘know’ or ‘see’ from which the noun *veda* derives. It restricts that power to seers, poets and priests \(*brahmán*, accented differently, or *brāhma*ṇ*a*\).

Early Vedic was originally the language of the Indo-Aryans but was gradually adopted by indigenous inhabitants of the subcontinent who had spoken and continued to speak many different languages. Apart from contributing to the composition of the Vedas, they inherited simple fire rituals that their ancestors or predecessors had performed on the steppes of Central Asia.

The Bharata chieftains are portrayed as practitioners of a multilateral policy. They combined poetic compositions from different tribes in an authoritative collection that was used to boost their morale and strengthen their hegemony. This early collection of ‘family books’ corresponds, how roughly we may never know, to the core of that part of the canon that was going to be established as ‘the Rigveda’. The period of Early Vedic ends with power using language and knowledge for political ends.



### Middle Vedic

This form of the language belongs to the period of Kuru and Pañcāla on the upper Gangetic plane between ca. 1200 and 700 BCE. The name Kuru is the name of a clan. The geographical regions where clans settled were generally called after them. In the case of the Kurus, this region was the district of Meerut and the territory situated some 100 miles north of Delhi called Kurukṣetra. That general area saw not only the codification of the Rigveda, but the putting together of three other collections that, together with other compositions, became the Sāma-, Yajur- and Atharvavedas. ‘The Kuru realm,’ as Witzel put it, ‘became the center of Brahmanical culture, with Kurukṣetra as the traditional heartland of Brahmanical orthopraxy’—that is, ritual.

Leading historians of India are not in full agreement about what kind of structure that Kuru centre possessed. Burton Stein \(1998\) called Kuru a *mahājanapada* which he translates as ‘great community’, skirting around the then fashionable interpretation of *janapada* as ‘republic’. According to him, some of the ‘great communities’ became states but that was after Kuru. According to Hermann Kulke and Dietmar Rothermund \(1998\), *janapada* referred first to the ‘place of a tribe’ and then to the territory of ‘a people’, using a term that is inoffensive and a little vague. Vagueness is not inappropriate when the evidence is as meagre as it admittedly is; but it does not resist generalization which is often more vague, not less. *Mahājanapada* accordingly became ‘great territory of a people’ \(like ‘great hall of the people’\). Romila Thapar \(2002\) refers to the Kuru–Pañcāla territories as confederations, accepts their inclusion among *mahājanapada*s and adds some precision: ‘The linchpin of the *janapada* had been the ruling clan, after which it was named, and this in turn ensured some linguistic and cultural commonality. But the *mahājanapada* was also incorporating varied cultures.’

‘Varied cultures’ is undoubtedly the *mot juste*. It adds substance to received wisdom and contributes to our understanding of the Middle Vedic period by recognizing, that composing Vedas should no longer be looked upon as an outpouring of Indo-Aryan sentiment and preoccupations, but reflected a variety of languages and cultures. It had been true of the Rigveda as we have seen in Part I and again at the beginning of Part II, but applies with greater clarity and force to the composers of the Yajur- and Atharvavedas. The Sāmaveda undoubtedly came from an indigenous, non-Indo-Aryan lineage. With the Yajurveda, composing Vedas became something like a job. The Atharvaveda is replete with local cults.

The Kuru started a confederation through alliance with the lineage of the Pañcāla clan. It does not follow that the Kuru were alien immigrants and the Pañcāla indigenous inhabitants of South Asia. It does not even follow that Kuru males took Pañcāla wives. We do not know much about ‘wives’ until we come to a marriage ceremony in the tenth circle. It is true that the Rigveda emphasized the male lineage. Throughout the Vedas, ancestors are referred to as *pit*ṛ, ‘fathers’. Transmission of the Vedic tradition was and remained patrilineal. Wendy Doniger’s statement on the Rigveda remains valid for the early compositions of Middle Vedic: ‘The Rigveda is a book by men about male concerns in a world dominated by men; one of these concerns is women, who appear throughout the hymns as objects, though seldom as subjects.’ Whether as subjects or objects, they became instruments, i.e., mothers of sons. But *male* is not the same as *alien immigrant*.

We shall return to goddesses, but the chief result of the Kuru–Pañcāla alliance from the perspective of the four Vedas is that it led to several Yajurvedas and explains the increasing importance of the concept of ‘school’ or ‘branch’ \(*śākhā*\). Each school goes back to the clan, tribe or community of a particular area. The Kaṭha or Kāṭhaka school of the Yajurveda represents the tradition as practised in Kurukṣetra. The Taittirīya of the Yajurveda and the Jaiminīya of the Sāmaveda started in Pañcāla from where they went south. A selection by Kuru–Pañcāla compositions from these and other schools, combined into one vast collection, became ‘the three Vedas’ of the early Vedic canon. By the time of its first establishment, various communities started speaking Vedic and using the phrase ‘our own people’. The Yajurveda invokes Soma as a guide against ‘hostilities committed by our own people and by others’.

During the Middle Vedic period, Soma, like Agni, a material substance as well as a deity, was *ritually* combined with Agni in vast and complex rituals. Its juices are extracted from the Soma plant which is ‘pressed’ or rather, beaten with stones. The structural features of these ceremonies and their ritual significance will be addressed in Chapter 12. Such activities should, if possible, be seen and heard for they are an essential feature of Vedic civilization. Describing ritual combinations and interactions between Agni and Soma in language is not only difficult but tedious. It helps to explain that those who composed Middle Vedic prose were no longer poets, let alone seers, but had become scholars. The vision of the Rigveda is replaced by a measure of pedantry. It explains similarities in interpretation between contemporary scholars and these early predecessors. Vision would return with the Upaniṣads when contributions were made by birds of different feathers.

During the latter parts of the Middle Indic period, a large number of Yajurveda compositions were composed, especially in the school of Taittirīya, named after the partridge \(*tittiri*\) which acted as a patronymic bird. Among the sub-schools of the Taittirīya, the Ā*pastamba*s lived on the banks of the Yamuna in the region of Mathura. They produced what became a popular ritual manual, the Āpastamba Śrauta Sūtra. It describes, like other manuals, large Soma rituals, performed for the benefit of a *yajamāna* or patron. At a culmination point in the ritual, the Adhvaryu priest of the Yajurveda arrives at the main altar with a long cloth tied around his head and dragging behind him. Underneath, the *yajamāna* and his family are hidden. They are about to take up residence in a new abode and the Adhvaryu proclaims the *yajamāna* as king. The participants shout: ‘Soma is the king of us brahmans\!’ At this point there appears a rare allusion to what may well have been historical events. Āpastamba explains that the subjects of the king are Bharatas, Kurus, Pañcālas, Kuru–Pañcālas and others. It expresses at the same time and in the clearest of terms the brāhmaṇs’ wish to wrest control from kṣatriya lineages. It does not follow that brāhmaṇs were descendents from speakers of Indo-Aryan and kṣatriyas were not. It suggests that both were interested in acquiring the power or alleged power of Vedic civilization.

Kuru–Pañcāla was also the region from where the construction or reconstruction of the Atharvaveda came. Its contents came from all over the place and some may be older than the Rigveda. It took a long time before the collection was accepted by scholars and other authorities, and the collocation of ‘Three Vedas’ was accordingly replaced by ‘Four Vedas’. Buddhism never seems to have realized that there were four Vedas and not three. The *Avadānaśataka*, a collection of legends or ‘glorious events’ \(*avadāna*\), mentions three Vedas and Buddhists have asked me: ‘What fourth Veda are you talking about?’



### Late Vedic

Late Vedic characterizes the confederations of Kośala and Videha, ca. 700–450 BCE. During this period, the White Yajurveda was compiled or extracted from the Black \(as will be explained below and more fully in Chapter 7\), other Kuru compositions were modified or reworked \(like the important Aitareya Brāhmaṇa of the Rigveda\), but the chief event of the period from our Vedic point of view was the final canonization of the four Vedas. The paradigm of canonization was the fixation of the precise form of the Rigveda, based upon a linguistic analysis that separated the words \(*pada*\) in each sentence from each other. It dissolved the *sandhi* of continuous speech \(*sa*ṃ*hitā*\): the linking of the sounds of words with those that precede and follow in the sentence and in nominal composition, often discernible within words, that Vedic shares with later Sanskrit. English *sandhi* is exemplified by the difference between ‘a mango’ and ‘an apple’. Here are the *Sa*ṃ*hitā* and *Padapā*ṭ*ha* of Rigveda 10.127.2:
>
> *Sa*ṃ*hitā* ‘continuous speech’:

> *orvaprā amartyā nivato devyudvata*ḥ/

> ‘The immortal Goddess has pervaded wide space, depths and heights.’ \(1\)

> *Padapā*ṭ*ha* ‘word-for-word analysis’:

> *ā/uru/aprā*ḥ*/amartyā/ni-vata*ḥ*/devī/ut-vata*ḥ

> ‘per/wide \(space\)/vaded/immortal/depths/goddess/heights.’ \(2\)

The reader who is so inclined will be able to derive underlying *sandhi* rules \(though not their formulation\) by combining the corresponding ‘words’ from Saṃhitā and Padapāṭha. It is not simple when three forms \(*ā/uru/aprā*ḥ\) are combined into one by following one of two paths that may be symbolized as ‘\(1–2\)–3’ and ‘1–\(2–3\)’ \(*Fourteen: Sūtra: Vedic Sciences*\).

The Padapāṭha was the work of a great scholar and scientist, the first great linguist in human history, known as ‘clever’ \(*vidagdha*\) Śākalya. Like Yājñavalkya, he lived at the eastern extremity of Vedic India but they were not friends. The Bṛhad-Āraṇyaka Upaniṣad describes, at roughly the same time, a series of questions they asked each other. When Yājñavalkya answers a question, Śākalya says, sarcastically, ‘Yes, of course’, and asks the next. But in the end he loses and his head shatters apart which suggests that *vidagdha* may have been a sarcastic epithet as well. Whatever the stories, Śākalya was not only clever but conscientious. He faithfully preserved early forms of the language that were no longer in use at his time. He did not treat them as ‘early’; but attributed them to the different regions from where, in fact, they came. Nor did he know that his Padapāṭha was creating a paradigm; but his analysis stands at the core of the third and final stage in the centuries-long process that led to the Rigveda collection or Ṛ*k-Sa*ṃ*hitā* as we more or less know it, and was adopted in due course by most of the other Vedic *Sa*ṃ*hitā* collections.

The view of a modern philologist \(as distinct from a linguist\) is *historical*. It starts with the Saṃhitā and derives the Padapāṭha from it. That is what happened in history and this is how I have described it. Śākalya’s perspective was a-historical, systematical and *analytic*. He was the first linguist.



### The Apotheosis of Schools

The combination of the four Vedas with all their auxiliary texts into a single canon was inspired by Śākalya’s analysis and his separation of words. It took place, likewise, in the eastern territories and is associated with the name of king Janaka of Videha, who attracted learned men from the west to introduce Kuru orthopraxy to his court. A great debate is said to have ensued, in which Yājñavalkya, the local celebrity, defeated these alien experts. The old Yajurveda was now called Black Yajurveda and found its ultimate refuge in South India. The White Yajurveda was established in the north where it continues to the present day.

According to post-Vedic myths like the *Vāyu Purā*ṇ*a,* the Yajurveda was first taught to twenty-seven pupils, one of them Yājñavalkya. The latter offended his teacher as was his wont. Ordered to disgorge what he had been taught, other pupils took the form of partridges and swallowed the soiled pieces, hence named ‘black’. A less fanciful explanation is that the White Yajurveda was called white because it separated mantra and brāhmaṇa portions which in the earlier Yajurveda *Sa*ṃ*hitā* collections had been mixed, thus returning to the purity of the Rigveda which consists of poetry only. By the end of the period, the corpus of Vedic compositions was closed though it had one open end: many Upaniṣads were added later and artificially attached to the Atharvaveda.

The chief subdivisions of the Four Vedas are the schools or branches \(*śākhā*\). They constitute an impressive edifice which is depicted in Table 1 on the following pages. On the left, its first column lists, from top to bottom, the four Vedas. The second column, immediately to its right, lists the forest of branches or schools.

To understand the table we must jump across it in two dimensions—without losing the threads \(*sūtra*\) that bind the pieces together. The second column depicts what should be our point of departure if we wish to understand ‘The Four Vedas’: the edifice of schools which was the great achievement of Middle Vedic. A glance at that column shows that it was created by the Yajurvedins, the followers of the Yajurveda. They created more schools than the other three Vedas together. It is they who created the concept of school: the other three Vedas followed their lead not by *creating* compositions \(they were already there\) but by *assigning them a place*. From then on the Rigveda was no longer the leader. It too was assigned its proper place. The assigner was the Yajurveda which came to occupy the centre and in so doing marks, more than the semi-alien Rigveda, Vedic civilization as it continued to be known.

Table 1: The Four Vedas

How did the Yajurvedins do it? With the help of ritual. The Yajurveda priests acquired power through the power of mantras, ritual and organization. A telling illustration will be treated at the start of Chapter 7 and in Chapter 13.

The Table of the Four Vedas will enable us to follow much of the development of the Vedas. The trick is not to try to memorize the many names, but to get some idea of the structure.

With this caveat we return to the third column which is labelled Saṃhitā: it refers to the continuous recitation of the initial and main part of each of the four Vedas. It is the linchpin of the system, the *ratha*-derived metaphor used by Romila Thapar, but we must take care not to confuse it with the first column. That first column lists the four Vedas which includes all the accretions as enumerated in the four columns to the right.

We are now in a position to explain the headings of those four remaining columns, some of them already familiar to the reader.

Column 4 lists the Brāhmaṇas. They are prose sections but were composed orally like all of the four Vedas. They are crucial to the development of the Yajurveda because of its division into two: the Black Yajurveda incorporates the Brāhmaṇas in the ‘Saṃhitā’ metrical sections on which they are commentaries and to which the Yajurvedins refer as mantra. The White Yajurveda separates its Brāhmaṇas from the mantras, thus attaining its alleged purity. It also explains some apparent anomalies which pertain to the fourth, fifth and sixth column of the White Yajurveda but cannot be pictured by the table because it is only a two-dimensional device: the Īśā Upaniṣad of the White Yajurveda is part of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, and the Bṛhad-Āraṇyaka Upaniṣad of that same Veda is the concluding section of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.

Column 5 lists the Āraṇyakas. They are ‘forest’ \(*ara*ṇ*ya*\) sections which does not mean that they are for ascetics though they may be concerned with meditation. Forests are places where powerful mantras or ideas may originate. It is not yet the third stage \(*āśrama*\) of life which was combined with caste \(*var*ṇ*a*\) in the *var*ṇ*āśrama* system, a product of the post-Vedic Dharma literature.

Column 6 lists the Upaniṣads that are ‘secret teachings’ in a special sense to which we return. They end with ‘etc.’ because it is an open category. We shall mainly be concerned with the so-called Classical Upaniṣads, those that fall within the Vedic period and are largely pre-Buddhist.

Column 7 lists the Śrauta Sūtras, structural descriptions of the Śrauta ritual with the help of *sūtra* rules to which we return in Chapter 14. They are in many respects different from any of the other categories of the Table. First, they deal with Śrauta ritual which we shall explore in Chapter 12. It is connected with the Soma rituals on which we touched briefly. Second, these sūtras were orally composed and transmitted; but their transmission was not confined to recitation and chant but practised by application \(*prayoga*\) in the field, that is, in the ritual arena. Performances of large Vedic rituals are, among other things, large rehearsals for the priests, for the junior priests especially, but also for all the others who sit around. They include the youngsters that will be the ritual experts of tomorrow. The Śrauta Sūtras, therefore, are concerned with the continuity and survival of the Vedic tradition. Recitation of mantras and singing of Sāmans are their fuel as are the altar fires into which the oblations of ghee or Soma are offered.

The earliest and most important of the Śrauta Sūtras is that of Baudhāyana who lived, like Śākalya and Yājñavalkya, at the eastern extremity of Vedic India but a little later. He was not only clever and conscientious but a great scientist who analysed, organized and explained structures of formidable complexity. He deserves a place in Chapter 14 where, for the sake of simplicity, I shall quote from the work of his younger colleague Āpastamba who is also listed under the Tattirīya Black Yajurveda in the last column of our Table.

We shall return to many of these topics in Chapters 5 to 10. As for the forest of names, they are like any other names: they originate from various backgrounds and I shall explain some of them later only if it seems relevant or interesting in some respect or other. We need not recall most or even any provided the Table of *Four: The Four Vedas*–81 is at hand. But we should remember that some of the schools may be late reflections of tribes.

The Table, finally, is not complete. Omitted are the Gṛhya Sūtras, which deal with domestic rites that will be touched upon in Chapters 8, 11 and 12; the Prātiśākhyas and Śulba Sūtras, which treat linguistics and geometry, respectively, subjects of Chapter 14; and a few others.

I can summarize our chapter on ‘The Four Vedas’ in simple terms. I have tried to show that The Four Vedas were cast into One Large Unit, but that is not what they were to begin with. The Vedas are not one of a piece. History shows this; and our summary shows in turn the relevance of revolutionary developments.

I can do no better than end with a quote for no one has amplified that summary better and is more qualified to place it in a wider perspective than Octavio Paz who was not only Mexico’s great poet but her ambassador to India:
>
> India was always in communication with other peoples and cultures of the Old World: first with Mesopotamia, and later with the Persians, Greeks, Kuchans, Romans, Chinese, Afghans, Mongols. The thought, religions and art of India were adopted by many Asian peoples; in turn, the Indians absorbed and transformed the ideas and creations of other cultures. The Mexican peoples did not experience anything like \(that\) …. They lived in an immense historical solitude; they never knew the essential and common experience of the Old World: the presence of the Other, the intrusions of strange civilizations with their gods, technical skills, visions of this world and the next.

Multiculturalism, until recently the correct fashion in the USA and Europe, treats Arabs, Chinese, Euro-Americans and Indians as if they inhabited separate cognitive worlds and were as isolated as were the Meso-American cultures. That idea is not supported by South Asia and not by the Vedas either.
