      <description>The Yajurveda is not simply the next Veda. Sāyaṇa, a scholar with a deep and wide-ranging knowledge of the Vedas, described the Rig- and Sāmavedas as the pictures (citra) and the Yajurveda as the wall (bhitti). If he is right, the reader has been reading about beautiful things—Rigveda poetry and Sāmaveda chants—and should now get ready for the study of what supports and holds them together. These supporting structures must refer to ritual, the domain of the Yajurveda, which is concerned with complex activities.</description>

      <description>There is more to it as we shall see in Chapter 13, but I am afraid we must return from Sāyaṇa to the Yajurveda and the Yajurvedins. The Adhvaryu priest of the Yajurveda was a typical product of Kuru orthopraxy, that is: he was concerned with ‘right action’ rather than ‘right opinion’ or ‘right belief’, the meanings of the term orthodoxy. His home was the ritual arena, especially as it is constructed for the performance of Soma ceremonies.</description>

      <description>The Adhvaryu and his three assistants do not only recite Mantras and Brāhmaṇas of their Yajurvedic school. They mutter brief formulas referred to as yajus. These accompany ritual acts and the Yajurveda is named after them. Many are muttered in a low voice: upāṃśu, ‘articulated (within the mouth) but inaudible’. Uttering them in a low voice strengthens them so that they will strengthen the mutterer as the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa puts it in its sacerdotal fashion.</description>
