title = "02 The Ritual Arena"

+++

There is more to it as we shall see in Chapter 13, but I am afraid we must return from Sāyaṇa to the Yajurveda and the Yajurvedins. The Adhvaryu priest of the Yajurveda was a typical product of Kuru *orthopraxy*, that is: he was concerned with ‘right action’ rather than ‘right opinion’ or ‘right belief’, the meanings of the term *orthodoxy*. His home was the ritual arena, especially as it is constructed for the performance of Soma ceremonies.

Its origins lie in ‘the ancient hut’ \(*prācīnava*ṃ*śa*\) and is depicted in Figure 15. There are three altars: on the left or west is the circular domestic or kitchen altar on which the oblations are cooked; on the right or east the square offering altar on which they are poured or thrown into the fire; and in between them, facing the south, a semi-circular altar which protects the officiants from sinister and dangerous influences emanating from the south.

To the east of the ‘ancient hut’, bottom right in Figure 16, a new enclosure is constructed, the Mahāvedi or ‘Great Altar Space’. It has a much larger roof and is made especially for ceremonies and other activities connected with Soma. On its western side, closest to the ‘ancient hut’, the *Sadas* is situated. It is surrounded by walls. It is the place where Rigvedins and Sāmavedins sit, recite and chant but also where they sip the Soma juice. To its east is the Havirdhāna where Soma is prepared and kept. At its eastern end is the new square offering altar where Agni will be carried in a pot and Soma and other oblations are offered to the gods.

The Yajurveda Adhvaryu was manager of the ritual, showing the path \(*adhvan*\) as his name indicates. He managed, perhaps manipulated the priests of the two older Vedas, who did not always see eye to eye, and put them together at the centre of the ritual arena which is called Sadas from *sad-*, ‘sit’, because it is the place where the priests sit. The central position of the Sadas is clear from Figure 16 and we shall return to in Chapter 13.

The Figure tells us a few more things. The rectangular area on the left or west, which has its own roof and is surrounded by low walls, represents the domestic arena that speakers of Indo-Aryan had taken with them from the steppes of inner Asia.

The rest of Figure 16 is a historical map which includes the ritual arena of the Soma ceremonies. Robert Gardner, the anthropological film-maker who was in charge of the documentation of the 1975 performance of the Agnicayana ritual \(see Preface\), called it the playpen.

This ritual arena contains several structures and altars, three of them within the Sadas, that are called or addressed by the priests with names that are non-Indo-European. As in the case of the chants discussed at the end of the previous chapter, some of these are BMAC words or names.

I have led the reader via a circuitous road to the ritual arena which is the centre of the Yajurveda just as the Sadas is the centre of the ritual arena. To see what the Yajurvedins exactly caused to happen inside the Sadas will become more transparent when we know a little more about ritual \(Chapter 12\) and, with special reference to the Sadas, in Chapter 13. The remainder of the present Chapter is an examination and discussion of specimens of *yajus*, Mantras and Brāhmaṇas from the Yajurveda.
