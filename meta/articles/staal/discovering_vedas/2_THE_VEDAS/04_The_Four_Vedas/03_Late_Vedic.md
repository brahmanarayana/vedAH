title = "03 Late Vedic"

+++

Late Vedic characterizes the confederations of Kośala and Videha, ca. 700–450 BCE. During this period, the White Yajurveda was compiled or extracted from the Black \(as will be explained below and more fully in Chapter 7\), other Kuru compositions were modified or reworked \(like the important Aitareya Brāhmaṇa of the Rigveda\), but the chief event of the period from our Vedic point of view was the final canonization of the four Vedas. The paradigm of canonization was the fixation of the precise form of the Rigveda, based upon a linguistic analysis that separated the words \(*pada*\) in each sentence from each other. It dissolved the *sandhi* of continuous speech \(*sa*ṃ*hitā*\): the linking of the sounds of words with those that precede and follow in the sentence and in nominal composition, often discernible within words, that Vedic shares with later Sanskrit. English *sandhi* is exemplified by the difference between ‘a mango’ and ‘an apple’. Here are the *Sa*ṃ*hitā* and *Padapā*ṭ*ha* of Rigveda 10.127.2:
>
> *Sa*ṃ*hitā* ‘continuous speech’:

> *orvaprā amartyā nivato devyudvata*ḥ/

> ‘The immortal Goddess has pervaded wide space, depths and heights.’ \(1\)

> *Padapā*ṭ*ha* ‘word-for-word analysis’:

> *ā/uru/aprā*ḥ*/amartyā/ni-vata*ḥ*/devī/ut-vata*ḥ

> ‘per/wide \(space\)/vaded/immortal/depths/goddess/heights.’ \(2\)

The reader who is so inclined will be able to derive underlying *sandhi* rules \(though not their formulation\) by combining the corresponding ‘words’ from Saṃhitā and Padapāṭha. It is not simple when three forms \(*ā/uru/aprā*ḥ\) are combined into one by following one of two paths that may be symbolized as ‘\(1–2\)–3’ and ‘1–\(2–3\)’ \(*Fourteen: Sūtra: Vedic Sciences*\).

The Padapāṭha was the work of a great scholar and scientist, the first great linguist in human history, known as ‘clever’ \(*vidagdha*\) Śākalya. Like Yājñavalkya, he lived at the eastern extremity of Vedic India but they were not friends. The Bṛhad-Āraṇyaka Upaniṣad describes, at roughly the same time, a series of questions they asked each other. When Yājñavalkya answers a question, Śākalya says, sarcastically, ‘Yes, of course’, and asks the next. But in the end he loses and his head shatters apart which suggests that *vidagdha* may have been a sarcastic epithet as well. Whatever the stories, Śākalya was not only clever but conscientious. He faithfully preserved early forms of the language that were no longer in use at his time. He did not treat them as ‘early’; but attributed them to the different regions from where, in fact, they came. Nor did he know that his Padapāṭha was creating a paradigm; but his analysis stands at the core of the third and final stage in the centuries-long process that led to the Rigveda collection or Ṛ*k-Sa*ṃ*hitā* as we more or less know it, and was adopted in due course by most of the other Vedic *Sa*ṃ*hitā* collections.

The view of a modern philologist \(as distinct from a linguist\) is *historical*. It starts with the Saṃhitā and derives the Padapāṭha from it. That is what happened in history and this is how I have described it. Śākalya’s perspective was a-historical, systematical and *analytic*. He was the first linguist.
