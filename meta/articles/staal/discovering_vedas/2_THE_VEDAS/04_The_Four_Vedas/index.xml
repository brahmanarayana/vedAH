      <description>This form of Vedic was spoken in the Indus Valley, ca. 1700–1200 BCE, by families and clans, the Vedic Indians by definition, whose language was adopted by others along with their mantras partly because of the power or alleged power of the latter. We are already familiar with some of its features because it is the period of the Rigveda. It resulted in verse that described sublime language (bráhman as well as vāc) as all-knowing (viśva-vid), a compound derived from viśva and the same verbal root vid- ‘know’ or ‘see’ from which the noun veda derives.</description>

      <description>This form of the language belongs to the period of Kuru and Pañcāla on the upper Gangetic plane between ca. 1200 and 700 BCE. The name Kuru is the name of a clan. The geographical regions where clans settled were generally called after them. In the case of the Kurus, this region was the district of Meerut and the territory situated some 100 miles north of Delhi called Kurukṣetra. That general area saw not only the codification of the Rigveda, but the putting together of three other collections that, together with other compositions, became the Sāma-, Yajur- and Atharvavedas.</description>

      <description>Late Vedic characterizes the confederations of Kośala and Videha, ca. 700–450 BCE. During this period, the White Yajurveda was compiled or extracted from the Black (as will be explained below and more fully in Chapter 7), other Kuru compositions were modified or reworked (like the important Aitareya Brāhmaṇa of the Rigveda), but the chief event of the period from our Vedic point of view was the final canonization of the four Vedas.</description>

      <description>The combination of the four Vedas with all their auxiliary texts into a single canon was inspired by Śākalya’s analysis and his separation of words. It took place, likewise, in the eastern territories and is associated with the name of king Janaka of Videha, who attracted learned men from the west to introduce Kuru orthopraxy to his court. A great debate is said to have ensued, in which Yājñavalkya, the local celebrity, defeated these alien experts.</description>
