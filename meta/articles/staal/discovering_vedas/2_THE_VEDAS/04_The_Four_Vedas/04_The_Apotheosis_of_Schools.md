title = "04 The Apotheosis of Schools"

+++

The combination of the four Vedas with all their auxiliary texts into a single canon was inspired by Śākalya’s analysis and his separation of words. It took place, likewise, in the eastern territories and is associated with the name of king Janaka of Videha, who attracted learned men from the west to introduce Kuru orthopraxy to his court. A great debate is said to have ensued, in which Yājñavalkya, the local celebrity, defeated these alien experts. The old Yajurveda was now called Black Yajurveda and found its ultimate refuge in South India. The White Yajurveda was established in the north where it continues to the present day.

According to post-Vedic myths like the *Vāyu Purā*ṇ*a,* the Yajurveda was first taught to twenty-seven pupils, one of them Yājñavalkya. The latter offended his teacher as was his wont. Ordered to disgorge what he had been taught, other pupils took the form of partridges and swallowed the soiled pieces, hence named ‘black’. A less fanciful explanation is that the White Yajurveda was called white because it separated mantra and brāhmaṇa portions which in the earlier Yajurveda *Sa*ṃ*hitā* collections had been mixed, thus returning to the purity of the Rigveda which consists of poetry only. By the end of the period, the corpus of Vedic compositions was closed though it had one open end: many Upaniṣads were added later and artificially attached to the Atharvaveda.

The chief subdivisions of the Four Vedas are the schools or branches \(*śākhā*\). They constitute an impressive edifice which is depicted in Table 1 on the following pages. On the left, its first column lists, from top to bottom, the four Vedas. The second column, immediately to its right, lists the forest of branches or schools.

To understand the table we must jump across it in two dimensions—without losing the threads \(*sūtra*\) that bind the pieces together. The second column depicts what should be our point of departure if we wish to understand ‘The Four Vedas’: the edifice of schools which was the great achievement of Middle Vedic. A glance at that column shows that it was created by the Yajurvedins, the followers of the Yajurveda. They created more schools than the other three Vedas together. It is they who created the concept of school: the other three Vedas followed their lead not by *creating* compositions \(they were already there\) but by *assigning them a place*. From then on the Rigveda was no longer the leader. It too was assigned its proper place. The assigner was the Yajurveda which came to occupy the centre and in so doing marks, more than the semi-alien Rigveda, Vedic civilization as it continued to be known.

Table 1: The Four Vedas

How did the Yajurvedins do it? With the help of ritual. The Yajurveda priests acquired power through the power of mantras, ritual and organization. A telling illustration will be treated at the start of Chapter 7 and in Chapter 13.

The Table of the Four Vedas will enable us to follow much of the development of the Vedas. The trick is not to try to memorize the many names, but to get some idea of the structure.

With this caveat we return to the third column which is labelled Saṃhitā: it refers to the continuous recitation of the initial and main part of each of the four Vedas. It is the linchpin of the system, the *ratha*-derived metaphor used by Romila Thapar, but we must take care not to confuse it with the first column. That first column lists the four Vedas which includes all the accretions as enumerated in the four columns to the right.

We are now in a position to explain the headings of those four remaining columns, some of them already familiar to the reader.

Column 4 lists the Brāhmaṇas. They are prose sections but were composed orally like all of the four Vedas. They are crucial to the development of the Yajurveda because of its division into two: the Black Yajurveda incorporates the Brāhmaṇas in the ‘Saṃhitā’ metrical sections on which they are commentaries and to which the Yajurvedins refer as mantra. The White Yajurveda separates its Brāhmaṇas from the mantras, thus attaining its alleged purity. It also explains some apparent anomalies which pertain to the fourth, fifth and sixth column of the White Yajurveda but cannot be pictured by the table because it is only a two-dimensional device: the Īśā Upaniṣad of the White Yajurveda is part of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, and the Bṛhad-Āraṇyaka Upaniṣad of that same Veda is the concluding section of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.

Column 5 lists the Āraṇyakas. They are ‘forest’ \(*ara*ṇ*ya*\) sections which does not mean that they are for ascetics though they may be concerned with meditation. Forests are places where powerful mantras or ideas may originate. It is not yet the third stage \(*āśrama*\) of life which was combined with caste \(*var*ṇ*a*\) in the *var*ṇ*āśrama* system, a product of the post-Vedic Dharma literature.

Column 6 lists the Upaniṣads that are ‘secret teachings’ in a special sense to which we return. They end with ‘etc.’ because it is an open category. We shall mainly be concerned with the so-called Classical Upaniṣads, those that fall within the Vedic period and are largely pre-Buddhist.

Column 7 lists the Śrauta Sūtras, structural descriptions of the Śrauta ritual with the help of *sūtra* rules to which we return in Chapter 14. They are in many respects different from any of the other categories of the Table. First, they deal with Śrauta ritual which we shall explore in Chapter 12. It is connected with the Soma rituals on which we touched briefly. Second, these sūtras were orally composed and transmitted; but their transmission was not confined to recitation and chant but practised by application \(*prayoga*\) in the field, that is, in the ritual arena. Performances of large Vedic rituals are, among other things, large rehearsals for the priests, for the junior priests especially, but also for all the others who sit around. They include the youngsters that will be the ritual experts of tomorrow. The Śrauta Sūtras, therefore, are concerned with the continuity and survival of the Vedic tradition. Recitation of mantras and singing of Sāmans are their fuel as are the altar fires into which the oblations of ghee or Soma are offered.

The earliest and most important of the Śrauta Sūtras is that of Baudhāyana who lived, like Śākalya and Yājñavalkya, at the eastern extremity of Vedic India but a little later. He was not only clever and conscientious but a great scientist who analysed, organized and explained structures of formidable complexity. He deserves a place in Chapter 14 where, for the sake of simplicity, I shall quote from the work of his younger colleague Āpastamba who is also listed under the Tattirīya Black Yajurveda in the last column of our Table.

We shall return to many of these topics in Chapters 5 to 10. As for the forest of names, they are like any other names: they originate from various backgrounds and I shall explain some of them later only if it seems relevant or interesting in some respect or other. We need not recall most or even any provided the Table of *Four: The Four Vedas*–81 is at hand. But we should remember that some of the schools may be late reflections of tribes.

The Table, finally, is not complete. Omitted are the Gṛhya Sūtras, which deal with domestic rites that will be touched upon in Chapters 8, 11 and 12; the Prātiśākhyas and Śulba Sūtras, which treat linguistics and geometry, respectively, subjects of Chapter 14; and a few others.

I can summarize our chapter on ‘The Four Vedas’ in simple terms. I have tried to show that The Four Vedas were cast into One Large Unit, but that is not what they were to begin with. The Vedas are not one of a piece. History shows this; and our summary shows in turn the relevance of revolutionary developments.

I can do no better than end with a quote for no one has amplified that summary better and is more qualified to place it in a wider perspective than Octavio Paz who was not only Mexico’s great poet but her ambassador to India:
>
> India was always in communication with other peoples and cultures of the Old World: first with Mesopotamia, and later with the Persians, Greeks, Kuchans, Romans, Chinese, Afghans, Mongols. The thought, religions and art of India were adopted by many Asian peoples; in turn, the Indians absorbed and transformed the ideas and creations of other cultures. The Mexican peoples did not experience anything like \(that\) …. They lived in an immense historical solitude; they never knew the essential and common experience of the Old World: the presence of the Other, the intrusions of strange civilizations with their gods, technical skills, visions of this world and the next.

Multiculturalism, until recently the correct fashion in the USA and Europe, treats Arabs, Chinese, Euro-Americans and Indians as if they inhabited separate cognitive worlds and were as isolated as were the Meso-American cultures. That idea is not supported by South Asia and not by the Vedas either.
