This form of Vedic was spoken in the Indus Valley, ca. 1700–1200 BCE, by families and clans, the Vedic Indians by definition, whose language was adopted by others along with their mantras partly because of the power or alleged power of the latter. We are already familiar with some of its features because it is the period of the Rigveda. It resulted in verse that described sublime language \(*bráhman* as well as *vāc*\) as all-knowing \(*viśva-vid*\), a compound derived from *viśva* and the same verbal root *vid-* ‘know’ or ‘see’ from which the noun *veda* derives. It restricts that power to seers, poets and priests \(*brahmán*, accented differently, or *brāhma*ṇ*a*\).

Early Vedic was originally the language of the Indo-Aryans but was gradually adopted by indigenous inhabitants of the subcontinent who had spoken and continued to speak many different languages. Apart from contributing to the composition of the Vedas, they inherited simple fire rituals that their ancestors or predecessors had performed on the steppes of Central Asia.

The Bharata chieftains are portrayed as practitioners of a multilateral policy. They combined poetic compositions from different tribes in an authoritative collection that was used to boost their morale and strengthen their hegemony. This early collection of ‘family books’ corresponds, how roughly we may never know, to the core of that part of the canon that was going to be established as ‘the Rigveda’. The period of Early Vedic ends with power using language and knowledge for political ends.
