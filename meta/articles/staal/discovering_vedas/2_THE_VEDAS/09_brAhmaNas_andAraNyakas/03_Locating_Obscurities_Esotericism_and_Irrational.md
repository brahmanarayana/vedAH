*Parokṣakāmā hi devā*ḥ: ‘The gods love what is out of sight\!’

I don’t know what the gods love, but we have to widen our perspective if we wish to understand, not only who were the brāhmaṇa authors of these early prose compositions of the Veda and to what kind of society they belonged, but what was in their minds insofar as it is distinct from what is in our own. Some people say: we cannot know, and stop there. I say: we must explore the unknown. This implies that we must begin to tolerate uncertainty. We want to find out what our Brāhmaṇa composers know but we are also aware that they do not know what we know. One thing we find is that they had different ideas about *conveying* knowledge.

The composers of the Rigveda initially composed for family or clan members. That is why much remains obscure to us, as it would be to other outsiders—but that was not the special intention of the creators. The audience they had in mind was their natural sounding board. When we come to the Brāhmaṇas and Āraṇyakas, the audience as well as the contexts have changed. It is clearly visible in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. We can speak here of esotericism or the keeping of secret doctrines. But what is secret here? Should we remain satisfied that it remains ‘out of sight?’

Some of it we can only understand too well. The mystic equivalences we find in the Brāhmaṇas and Upaniṣads, referred to as *bandhu*, are often connected with pseudo-etymologies and sometimes it is enough for them to share a sound \(e.g., the consonant *p* as in *puroruc* is *prāṇa*, ‘vital breath’\). They may be based on loose semantics, as in the Śatapatha’s repeated declarations: ‘Ritual is language’ or ‘Ritual is man.’ They are explained by fancy reasons that point at existing connections which do not, however, establish that the two members are *identical*. Thus, ‘Ritual is language’ is explained by saying that utterances of language accompany ritual; and ‘Ritual is man’ by explaining that ritual measurements are based upon the size of the ritual patron. But ritual is neither and what is gained by spreading confusion? It may keep outsiders out and insiders in which is where they already are. Since they perform no other function and there is neither content nor literary flavour in any of these games, they can only be described as puerile.

I am not saying that the authors of these nonsensical phrases are stupid. They know the intricacies of ritual—a complex topic—and the grammatical rules and properties of their language. As for irrationalities, these are common worldwide and possess a certain straightforwardness. They are ultimately reduceable to contradictions of the form, ‘*A is not–A.*’ They make no sense and do not convey anything because the function of the particle *not* is to deny what follows and one cannot at the same time affirm and deny in the same respct. Contradictory knowledge is not knowledge. It is another way of saying that Brāhmaṇas are not veda.

Rational insight is a rare commodity compared to the vast universe of irrationalities that people and language produce. Knowledge, therefore, is the ferreting out of what is of value. This was clearly explained by Āryabhaṭa, the greatest Indic mathematician before Srinivasa Ramanujan, who described one of his discoveries as ‘a precious sunken jewel from the ocean of true and false knowledge’. Al-Bīrūnī, equally great as a scientist and also a student of Indic civilization, characterized Indic science in similar terms as ‘a mixture of pearl shells and sour dates, or of pearls and dung, or of costly crystal and common pebbles’. Since he was a Muslim and outsider, his statement caused irritation and even anger though it is essentially the same as Āryabhaṭa’s. A similar statement, even more colourful is due to Johannes Keppler, scientist and mystic:
>
> No one should regard it as incredible that out of the nonsense and godlessness of astrology,  
not a useful thought or insight,  
out of dirty slime, not something edible for a snail, mussel, oyster or eel,  
out of a big heap spun by caterpillars not a spider,  
and finally out of a stinking pile of excrement, by an industrious chicken  
not something, a good grain, even a pearl or gold pellet, can be extracted and found.

It looks as if Keppler knew, or would have loved to know, that the lotus is born from mud \(*paṇkaja*\). If his verdict applies to the history of science, should we expect the bulky Brāhmaṇas to be excluded? They are not and it is time for us to look for gold pellets.

The Rigvedic Aitareya Brāhmaṇa \(AB\) is the earliest source that is explicit about the Sarasvatī river ‘ending in the desert’. As we have seen at the beginning of Part I, the Rigveda called it Sarasvatī after a river their ancestors or predecessors had encountered earlier: the *Harax’aitî*. Both names mean ‘provided with ponds’. and refer to two rivers that ended in the desert. The AB knew this because it was familiar with Sind which the Rigveda was not. The same information is found in other Brāhmaṇas, such as the Jaiminīya and the Pañcaviṃśa of the Sāmaveda, which add details on rituals performed on the very spot where the river disappeared in the sand.

On a different level, the AB provides valuable pearls in its description of some of the details of Vedic pronunciation. These include a first discussion of the concept of *upāṃśu* and reflections of phonetics and phonology that pertain not only to Vedic recitation, but to the emerging uses of the living language of spoken Sanskrit. They led to the *Prātiśākhya* treatises of the Vedic science of language, to Pāṇini’s Sanskrit grammar and to modern linguistics as will be sketched later in Chapter 14.

Other valid insights are hidden in the muddy contexts of the Aitareya Āraṇyaka \(AA\). We shall see in that same Chapter, that Śākalya separated the words of the Rigveda Saṃhitā from each other in his Padapāṭha. The AA was familiar with earlier terminologies that refer to these varieties. The AA also discussed nominal compounds such as the expression *pada-pāṭha*, ‘recitations of words’, itself; and the various relationships between its two members. The AA chronicles mythological views according to which the prior part of such compounds refers to earth, the later part to the heavens, and their Saṃhitā combination to the wind. Others argued that Saṃhitā is the space between heaven and earth. Whatever one may think of the speculations, they presuppose precise knowledge of *sandhi* or ‘euphonic combination’, syntax and the properties of nominal compounds.

The Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa of the Rigveda, commenting on the *puroruc* ‘prior light’ recital that precedes the recitation of a Rigvedic hymn, provides a bit of slime on which we almost slipped in Chapter 7 \(*Seven: Yajurveda*\). It is not contradictory but slimy because it is tantamount to saying: it may be A because of X, or perhaps B, or maybe C.

I conclude that there is much in the Vedic tradition that we do not know or understand. The same holds for the Brāhmaṇas and other Vedic prose, but with one difference: they did not want us to know. That makes trying to know more difficult, but still enables us to draw two conclusions that apply to both Vedic poetry and prose: \(1\) the composers might have known more than we do; and \(2\) there is no reason to believe that the smartest among us are smarter than the smartest among them.
