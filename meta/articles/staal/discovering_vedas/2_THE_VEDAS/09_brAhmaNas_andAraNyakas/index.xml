      <description>In Chapter 1 I have referred to a hypothetical period of 9,000 years during which the indigenous lineages of the subcontinent of South Asia remained widespread in both tribal and caste populations. Whether it was actually 9,000 years or more or less is irrelevant from our Vedic point of view. Other facts are more significant in our present context: Chapter 3 showed that caste was assigned to the Vedas by a post-Vedic and caste-obsessed society.</description>

      <description>We have seen that the term Brāhmaṇa is used in several senses. The meaning with which we are concerned in this chapter is one of them: a Vedic composition in prose. In the Yajurveda, that composition is mainly concerned with interpretations of mantras in ritual terms. In the Rig-, Sāma- and Atharva-Vedas, a Brāhmaṇa is more like a separate unit—what we have in mind when we think of a ‘book’. But all these compositions continue to be oral and orally transmitted, sometimes with the old accents.</description>

      <description>Parokṣakāmā hi devāḥ: ‘The gods love what is out of sight!’
I don’t know what the gods love, but we have to widen our perspective if we wish to understand, not only who were the brāhmaṇa authors of these early prose compositions of the Veda and to what kind of society they belonged, but what was in their minds insofar as it is distinct from what is in our own. Some people say: we cannot know, and stop there.</description>
