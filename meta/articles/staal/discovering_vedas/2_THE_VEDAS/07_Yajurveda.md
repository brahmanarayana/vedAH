### The Role of the Yajurveda

The Yajurveda is not simply the next Veda. Sāyaṇa, a scholar with a deep and wide-ranging knowledge of the Vedas, described the Rig- and Sāmavedas as the pictures \(*citra*\) and the Yajurveda as the wall \(*bhitti*\). If he is right, the reader has been reading about beautiful things—Rigveda poetry and Sāmaveda chants—and should now get ready for the study of what supports and holds them together. These supporting structures must refer to ritual, the domain of the Yajurveda, which is concerned with complex activities. How to understand these structures? Must we wade through masses of ritual descriptions?

Stephen Lindquist is right that we should sometimes pay attention to traditional interpreters who may preserve something a modern scholar cannot know. Sir Harold Bailey did not agree with it, as we shall see in a moment, but it certainly applies to Sāyaṇa, who was chief minister of Harihara II, one of the rulers of the Vijayanagar empire which controlled a large part of South India in the fourteenth century CE. Together with his equally gifted brother Mādhava, who wrote on philosophy and also served Harihara II, Sāyaṇa contributed to the fame of the empire in the areas of arts and letters by writing extensive commentaries on the Vedas. Sāyaṇa knew Vedic ritual well because the Vijayanagar period was a period of Vedic revival as had been the Chola period earlier and the Gupta period earlier still.

I played records of Veda recitation in the rooms of Sir Harold Bailey at Cambridge which were also his library. The reader will remember him as one of the reviewers of Wasson’s book on Soma \(*Five: Rigveda*\). Bailey had the habit of putting pamphlets, offprints, booklets and books into other books rather than next to each other. With few students in attendance, he used a carton board to which he attached large sheets of paper. Each time I had filled a sheet with the help of a crayon, he tore it off carefully. We discussed the meaning and etymology of words and I asked Bailey whether he took Sāyaṇa’s interpretations into account. He raised his bushy eyebrows whimsically and said that Sāyaṇa, when he does not know the meaning of a word, says that it means water. Bailey, who was familiar with all the early languages of the Indo-European family and many others, was an etymologist at heart. He once made a passing suggestion, perhaps because of his liking for Wasson \(*Five: Rigveda*\), that *soma* should not be derived from the root *su-* and the suffix *ma-*, but analysed as *som-a* in which the first element corresponds to German *Schwamm*, Latin *fungus,* Greek *spongia* = English *sponge* and other Indo-European terms for mushroom. No one took it seriously. Having come this far we should recall what Voltaire said about etymology: it is a science where vowels count for nothing and consonants for little. Yes, etymology is more speculative than old-fashioned philology but not as speculative as string theory in modern physics.

Geldner in his Rigveda translation mentions Sāyaṇa often. According to Renou, we should look at what he says but not forget that there is a gap of thirty centuries between him and the Rigveda and the tradition that connects them has been interrupted often. Each gap lasted many centuries. One between the Vedic period and the Gupta \(more than a millennium\), a second between Gupta and Chola, a third between Chola and Vijayanagar, a fourth between Vijayanagar and the present. Plenty of time to forget again and again. But there is strength in the Oral Tradition and assiduous training in schools and on the ritual grounds. The Upaniṣads know what preserves it and remind us: Revere Memory\!

We may get an idea of what Sāyaṇa imagined when he declared that the Yajurveda constructed a suitable space for Rig- and Sāmaveda to display their beauty. He was thinking of murals that were fashionable during the Vijayanagar period. I have seen one that relates to our story. Like Sāyaṇa and Mādhava who were in the service of Harihara II, the latter’s predecessors, Harihara I and Bukka, were also brothers. During a war with the Sultanate in Delhi, they were captured and taken not to an undisclosed place, but to Delhi where they embraced Islam which stood them well with the Sultan. In due course they were freed and dispatched back, this time to quench a revolt. It was not a wise decision on the part of the Sultan, though there are different versions of what happened. According to one, the two brothers fell under the spell of Vidyāraṇya, not only a scholar who wrote on philosophy but a great sage. Fired by his teaching, they returned to the Hindu fold and continued to pursue schemes of conquest and consolidation. According to another version, Vidyāraṇya was an insignificant ascetic who was Jagadguru or Śaṇkarācārya of the Śṛṇgeri Maṭha, stronghold of the Advaita Vedānta.

The large and beautiful painting that I saw comes from the ruins of Hampi and depicts Vidyāraṇya being carried in procession on a palanquin \(see Figure 14\). He looks like a great sage rather than an insignificant ascetic. I prefer that version of the story, but the significant point in our context is that it is a ceiling panel painted behind walls. Sāyaṇa was, of course, familiar with this painting. His simile seems to refer to the walls of the Sadas in which Sāmavedins sing their *stuti*, Rigvedins recite their *śastra*s and both drink Soma. I have not found the term *bhitti* used with reference to the Sadas, but it is used in similar contexts in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa and the Maitri Upaniṣad.



### The Ritual Arena

There is more to it as we shall see in Chapter 13, but I am afraid we must return from Sāyaṇa to the Yajurveda and the Yajurvedins. The Adhvaryu priest of the Yajurveda was a typical product of Kuru *orthopraxy*, that is: he was concerned with ‘right action’ rather than ‘right opinion’ or ‘right belief’, the meanings of the term *orthodoxy*. His home was the ritual arena, especially as it is constructed for the performance of Soma ceremonies.

Its origins lie in ‘the ancient hut’ \(*prācīnava*ṃ*śa*\) and is depicted in Figure 15. There are three altars: on the left or west is the circular domestic or kitchen altar on which the oblations are cooked; on the right or east the square offering altar on which they are poured or thrown into the fire; and in between them, facing the south, a semi-circular altar which protects the officiants from sinister and dangerous influences emanating from the south.

To the east of the ‘ancient hut’, bottom right in Figure 16, a new enclosure is constructed, the Mahāvedi or ‘Great Altar Space’. It has a much larger roof and is made especially for ceremonies and other activities connected with Soma. On its western side, closest to the ‘ancient hut’, the *Sadas* is situated. It is surrounded by walls. It is the place where Rigvedins and Sāmavedins sit, recite and chant but also where they sip the Soma juice. To its east is the Havirdhāna where Soma is prepared and kept. At its eastern end is the new square offering altar where Agni will be carried in a pot and Soma and other oblations are offered to the gods.

The Yajurveda Adhvaryu was manager of the ritual, showing the path \(*adhvan*\) as his name indicates. He managed, perhaps manipulated the priests of the two older Vedas, who did not always see eye to eye, and put them together at the centre of the ritual arena which is called Sadas from *sad-*, ‘sit’, because it is the place where the priests sit. The central position of the Sadas is clear from Figure 16 and we shall return to in Chapter 13.

The Figure tells us a few more things. The rectangular area on the left or west, which has its own roof and is surrounded by low walls, represents the domestic arena that speakers of Indo-Aryan had taken with them from the steppes of inner Asia.

The rest of Figure 16 is a historical map which includes the ritual arena of the Soma ceremonies. Robert Gardner, the anthropological film-maker who was in charge of the documentation of the 1975 performance of the Agnicayana ritual \(see Preface\), called it the playpen.

This ritual arena contains several structures and altars, three of them within the Sadas, that are called or addressed by the priests with names that are non-Indo-European. As in the case of the chants discussed at the end of the previous chapter, some of these are BMAC words or names.

I have led the reader via a circuitous road to the ritual arena which is the centre of the Yajurveda just as the Sadas is the centre of the ritual arena. To see what the Yajurvedins exactly caused to happen inside the Sadas will become more transparent when we know a little more about ritual \(Chapter 12\) and, with special reference to the Sadas, in Chapter 13. The remainder of the present Chapter is an examination and discussion of specimens of *yajus*, Mantras and Brāhmaṇas from the Yajurveda.



### Yajurveda Mantras and Brāhmaṇas

The Adhvaryu and his three assistants do not only recite Mantras and Brāhmaṇas of their Yajurvedic school. They mutter brief formulas referred to as *yaju*s. These accompany ritual acts and the Yajurveda is named after them. Many are muttered in a low voice: *upā*ṃ*śu*, ‘articulated \(within the mouth\) but inaudible’. Uttering them in a low voice strengthens them so that they will strengthen the mutterer as the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa puts it in its sacerdotal fashion. The meaning of the word is more interesting: it comes from *a*ṃ*śu,* the stalk of the Soma plant and *upa* which means ‘close’ \(as in *upa-ni*ṣ*ad*, ‘sitting close’\). The Soma drink is obtained from pressing these stalks which are, therefore, the essential part of the plant. In Soma rituals, prior to the main pressing, there is an *upā*ṃ*śu-graha* or small pressing before sunrise. It takes place without recitation; the Adhvaryu keeps silent \(‘restrains his voice’\) as on many other occasions. But the Śrauta Sūtras display variations: breath may be taken or not, different deities are involved, etc. It is a somewhat mystifying and flexible word: it may occur as a noun, adjective or adverb.

*Upā*ṃ*śu* occurs in other ritual contexts and rites. Brereton has studied its uses in the ‘New and Full Moon Rituals’ \(*darśa-pūr*ṇ*a-māsa*, which according to Gonda should be translated as ‘Full and New Moon Rituals’\). He has reported much variation in its description by the Śrauta Sūtras. He refers to the view of the Taittirīya Saṃhitā that *upā*ṃ*śu* originated in the Full and New Moon Rituals, which is unlikely since there is no Soma pressing there. Brereton’s most important conclusion is that the *upā*ṃ*śu* provides an inaudible centre around which the recursive structure of ritual is organized. He had already emphasized the importance of such structures in ‘Why is a Sleeping Dog like the Vedic Sacrifice?’ The similarity is that the beginning and end are the same. The sleeping dog has no centre, but other structures do and many are recursive, that is, they can be applied to themselves, again and again. I shall return to these topics in Chapters 11 and 12.

Apart from inaudibles, there are silences. The most common is called *tūṣṇīṃ*, ‘in silence’ or *tūṣṇīṃ-japa*, ‘muttering silently’. I shall return to them in Chapter 15, but our present context is *yajus* recitations. One repeats structures of the form A B B A, e.g.: ‘Agni \(is\) light, light Agni; Indra light, light Indra.’ Another is recited by the ritual patron, on whose behalf and for whose benefit the ritual is done: it is his ‘abandon’ \(*tyāga*\) after each oblation, e.g.: ‘this is for Agni, not for me\!’ \(*agnaye ida*ṃ *na mama*; and similarly for other gods\). The statement is ungrammatical: the correct form is: *agnaya ida*ṃ *na mama*—a feature that is of no ritual relevance.

The *yajus* ‘ritual formulas’ are different from Yajurveda Mantras and Brāhmaṇas. The Mantras are often taken or adapted from the Rigveda into Middle Indic and collected in the Yajurveda Saṃhitā which is also in poetry but followed by or mixed with prose Brāhmaṇas, interpretations of the Mantra sections in ritual terms. The mixture is typical of the Krishna or Black Yajurveda. Reacting to this, the Śukla or White Yajurveda Vājasaneyī Saṃhitā consists in its entirety of Mantras, a return in this respect to the Rigveda. Its Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa is separate and in prose.

During the Kuru period, composing Vedas no longer reflected an inspired vision but had become a job. The change may be due to the occupation or occupations of the Yajurvedins before they became Yajurvedins, but we know nothing about it.

Many of the accompanying changes are reflected by the new or widened uses of the term *brāhma*ṇ*a*. The reader may have picked them up along the way:

1. a learned man, expert, priest or professor, who occupies a fixed niche in a community but does not speak for it, unlike the poet whose language gives it a voice;
2. a composition in prose that accompanies and interprets the mantra portions composed in verse that are recited during the ritual \(in the earliest Yajurvedas\);
3. a separate work, also in prose, that is similarly concerned with the interpretation of mantras and rites \(in the White Yajurveda and the other Vedas\).
4. a member of the highest caste \(post-Vedic\).

The Yajurveda ritualized deities-cum-substances of the Rigveda such as Agni and Soma. Early rituals were expanded, new ones added and all combined and organized in a new form called *śrauta* \(from *śruti*, ‘what is heard’, i.e. ‘learned’\). The ceremonies were performed under the direction of four priests: Hotā for the Rigveda, Udgātā for the Sāmaveda, Adhvaryu for the Yajurveda and Brahman, assigned somewhat theoretically to the Atharvaveda. Each had three assistants. The Four Vedas became the sound foundation—in two senses of ‘sound’—of Kuru orthopraxy. Through the Adhvaryu, chief manager of the Śrauta ritual, the Yajurveda became the core of the tradition, maintaining the walls which concealed its greatest treasures as Sāyaṇa described them.

One of the most highly developed and famous Śrauta rituals of the Kuru era, allegedly first performed around 1,000 BCE, was the Agnicayana or ‘piling of Agni’. Its defining feature is a large offering altar constructed in the form of a bird in five layers from a thousand kiln-fired bricks. It is piled in the place of the small square offering altar depicted at the extreme right of Figure 16, at the eastern end of the Mahāvedi. The configuration of bricks in the first layer will be explained in Chapter 14.

Numerous rites are unique to the Agnicayana ritual. At its beginning, fire is placed in a clay dish with eight breasts or udders around its circumference. Its preparation is accompanied by long recitations. The following are taken from the Taittirīya Saṃhitā, based upon Keith’s translation. The mantras include a few from the Rigveda, with variations. Savitā is the sun, especially before rising:

MANTRAS \(Taittirīya Saṃhitā 4.1.1\)

1. First harnessing the mind, Savitā, Creating thoughts and perceiving light, Brought Agni from the earth.
2. Harnessing the gods with mind, They who go with thought to the sky, to heaven, Savitā instigates those who will make great light.
3. With the mind harnessed, we are instigated by god Savitā For strength to go to heaven.
4. Priests of the lofty wise priest harness their mind, harness their thoughts. He who alone is possessed of knowledge distributed the priestly duties: Great be the praise of god Savitā.
5. I harness with honour your ancient hymn. The verse go like Sūras on their way. All the sons of immortality who have ascended to divine abodes are listening.
6. Whose journey the other gods follow, praising the power of the god, Who measured the radiant regions of the earth, He is the great god Savitā.
7. God Savitā, impel the ritual\! Impel for good fortune the lord of ritual\! Divine Gandharva, purifier of thought, purify our thoughts\! Today may the lord of speech make our words sweet\!
8. God Savitā, impel for us this ritual, Honouring the gods, gaining friends, Always victorious, winning wealth, winning heaven\!

The Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa begins with identifications based upon identical numbers \(‘four oblations’/‘four feet’\), a favourite mode of interpretation, but the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa asks a straightforward question: why should the Agnicayana ritual, which is dedicated to Agni, start with mantras that invoke Savitā? The answer is that Savitā is the sun which is invoked for ‘instigation’ \(*prasūti*\). The Brāhmaṇa is lengthy and I select a few passages only:

BRĀHMAṆA \(Taittirīya Saṃhitā 5.1.1\)
>
> He \(the Adhvaryu\) offers the Savitā offerings, for instigation. He offers with an oblation ladled up four times, cattle have four feet; thus he wins cattle; the quarters are four; thus he finds support in the quarters …. He abandons prosperity at the beginning of the ritual when he departs from Agni as the deity. These offerings to Savitā number eight, the Gāyatrī has eight syllables, Agni is connected with the Gāyatrī. Therefore he does not abandon prosperity at the beginning of the ritual, nor Agni as the deity …. With four verses he takes up the spade; the metres are four; thus he takes it up with the metres. ‘Instigated by god Savitā’ he says for instigation. Agni went away from the gods, he entered a reed; he resorted to the hole which is formed by the perforation of the reed. The spade is perforated to make it his birthplace. Wherever he lived, that became black; the spade is stained, for perfection of form and colour; it is open at both ends for the winning of light both from here and the other world. It is a fathom long; so much is the strength of man. It is commensurate with his strength and unlimited in girth to win what is unlimited. That tree which has fruit is strong among trees, the reed bears fruit, the spade is of reed to gain strength.

The four-ladled oblation and the ritual spade belong to the vast ritual knowledge of the commentator. The hole of the reed which marks Agni’s birthplace does not stand in need of a Freudian interpretation. It would first need to be shown that sexual associations of holes, that may have been repressed by the Viennese before Freud, were repressed by the Vedic Indians, an effort that is unlikely to meet with success. Passages that we would regard as sexual or erotic occur almost anywhere in the Vedas. The ways we react to them throw light not on them but on us. The Rigveda tells us about Apālā, a young woman who was rejected by her husband because she had a skin disease. The Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa of the Sāmaveda continues: she found a Soma stalk in a river and chewed on it. Her teeth sounded like pressing stones and Indra came running, but she recited her own story from the Rigveda. Indra then sucked the Soma from her mouth: ‘it verily becomes like a Soma drink for him who knows this when one kisses a woman’s mouth’ \(translation Hanns-Peter Schmidt\).

The Bṛhad-Āraṇyaka Upaniṣad of the White Yajurveda \(BĀU 6.4.3\) equates the sexual act with a Soma ritual: ‘Her vulva is the sacrificial ground; her pubic hair is the sacred grass; her labia majora are the Soma-press; her labia minora are the fire blazing at the centre. A man who engages in sexual intercourse with this knowledge obtains as great a world as a man who performs a Soma sacrifice’ \(translation Olivelle\).

That the Rigveda does not repress sex is amply illustrated by Wendy Doniger’s selections and is not confined to what some moderns regard as ‘straight.’ Indra is fond of all adventures. The majority were with women, but he wanted to experience sex from the other side and became the wife of Vṛṣaṇaśva, ‘Bull Horse Man’, who was so strong that he used for his chariot bulls instead of horses \(RV 1.51.13\). It would be far-fetched to classify Indra as a closet *pa*ṇḍ*aka*—a term for a ‘\(passive\) homosexual’ in later Sanskrit \(*Sixteen: Buddhism*\). Indra liked variety, that much is clear.

The Yajurveda contains a series of mantras recited by the patron that contain long enumerations of very large numbers. It occurs after the construction of the Agnicayana altar from a thousand bricks has been completed:
>
> May these bricks, O Agni, be milch cows for me, one, and a hundred, and a thousand, and ten thousand, and a hundred thousand, and a million, and ten million \(107\), and a hundred million \(108\), and a thousand million \(109\), and ten thousand million \(1010\), and a hundred thousand million \(1011\), and a thousand thousand million \(1012\), and a hundred hundred thousand million \(1013\) \(Taittirīya Saṃhitā 4.4.11 p\).

After a million, the powers of ten have been added since English has not been very good at generating names for such large numbers—an undeveloped language compared to Vedic that has separate terms for each of them. Powers of ten would be needed in any case if we were to describe the large numbers introduced by the ancient Jainas, that went up to 1023, or the Buddhists and the Ramayana, each going up to 1060.

The patron has not completed his recitation and adds another round with a variation:
>
> May these bricks, O Agni, be milch cows for me, sixty, a thousand, ten thousand, unperishing \(Taittirīya Saṃhitā 4.4.11 p.\)

The large numbers that occur in Vedic have nothing to do with the universe. They belong to mathematics; and might in contemporary terms be interpreted as a manifestation of corporate greed. The mysterious sixty is put in context in the section on Vedic mathematics in Chapter 14 \(*Fourteen: Sūtra: Vedic Sciences*\). The non-Vedic numbers refer to years that measure the age of the cosmos; and express its immense size.

A few pages ago we came across quarters or four-somes such as ‘four oblations’ and ‘four feet’. These will also be put in context in the section on Vedic mathematics. The majority of Brāhmaṇa interpretations wander around without arriving at a conclusion. The *yajus* recitation ‘Agni light,… light Agni …,’ has a technical name: *puroruc*, literally ‘light in front’. The Brāhmaṇa interprets:
>
> Now, the *puroruc* is he yonder who gives out light \(i.e., the sun; for he shines in front\). Now the *puroruc* is the vital breath, the words, the body or the person himself. \(Or\) the *puroruc* is the body, the words offspring and cattle.

Other Brāhmaṇas are similarly rambling. A few interpretations are straightforward, some obvious and many trite. The large majority appear to be entirely arbitrary. The simple truth is that there is little that the Brāhmaṇas do *not* say. It explains their continued fascination for those who wish to prove a point by invoking an ancient authority.

If all that is true there must also be much or at least something in the Brāhmaṇas that is valuable and valid. There is indeed, but it must be ferretted out. Unintended as such by the composers, there is information about ancient India, its inhabitants, society, history and other matters of fact. Here is an illustration, beginning with the Mantras:

MANTRAS \(Taittirīya Saṃhitā 1.5.10.3\)
>
> O Agni, lord of vows, I shall perform this vow; may

> I accomplish it; may it be successful for me.

> Agni, the priest, I summon here.

> The gods who are worthy of ritual, whom we invoke,

> Let these gods come in kindly mind.

> Let these gods enjoy this oblation of me.

BRĀHMAṆA \(Taittirīya Saṃhitā 1.6.7.2–3\)
>
> He takes fire; he appropriates the gods in their own abode; to them he sacrifices when the next day comes. When about to undertake a vow, he should say: ‘O Agni, lord of vows, I shall perform this vow.’ Agni is the lord of vows among the gods; therefore, after announcing it to him, he undertakes his vow. At full moon he undertakes his vow with the spreading of grass, at new moon by driving the calves away, for that is their abode.

> People say that the fires, in front and at the back, must be covered; men indeed desire what is covered with grass, how much more the gods whose dwellings are new. The gods dwell with him who peforms the rites on the next day, who knowingly covers the fire. People say that the ritualist should take animals both domesticated and wild. If he desists from eating domestic animals they increase in number; wild animals are only useful if eaten \(?\). If he were to fast without eating, the ancestors would be his divinity. If he eats wild animals, he bestowes their power upon himself. If he were to fast without eating, he would be hungry; if he were to eat, Rudra would plan evil against his cattle. If he partakes of water, it is neither eaten nor not eaten; and Rudra would not do evil to his cattle. The ritual is a thunderbolt, the enemy of man is hunger. If he fasts without eating, he immediately slays with that thunderbolt the enemy which is hunger.

The commentary declares that the gods should enjoy the oblations, because they can be eaten and there is hunger. Not edifying messages perhaps to us, but they show that also in Vedic times, many were hungry. Perhaps the composers of these lines were the first poor brahman priests—a topos of Sanskrit literature—speaking the Vedic language that had become the language of many. It tells us something about life in the Ganges Valley during the period of Middle and Late Vedic, that is from roughly 1000 to 450 BCE.

We have completed our survey of *three* Vedas. There are good reasons for keeping them together. The Rigveda is the first and most ancient. It incorporated local elements, but was a fresh apparition on the Indic scene. Largely composed within the subcontinent, it included features from elsewhere such as its language and all that it entailed. The Sāmaveda refers to the Rigveda but was an indigenous priestly tradition with its own language or languages as well as ritual structures. It incorporated verse from the Rigveda and inherited a few names from the BMAC. We know virtually nothing about its origins. The Yajurveda refers to Rig- \(RV\) and Sāmaveda \(SV\) both. It incorporated RV verse and SV chants in its ritual framework that may have developed from other rites and prototypes about which we know nothing except that there are links with the BMAC. The Yajurveda was the *locus* of the concept and the edifice of the Vedic schools as depicted by Table I \(*Four: The Four Vedas*\), which was adopted by the other two Vedas. ‘The Three Vedas’ are still the only ones mentioned in Buddhist texts and in the law code of Manu \(second century CE\). Four Vedas are mentioned in the Mahabharata epic and in later literatures. They include the Fourth or Atharva Veda to which we shall now turn.
