title = "05 Dhyāna, Meditation and the End of the Veda"

+++

Whether or not we are brahman and whether or not the ethical dimensions of the *karma* doctrine are Upaniṣadic, the karma doctrine is related to something else that is Indic and goes beyond it: techniques of concentration or meditation \(*dhyāna*, *abhidhyāna*\). They are Vedic because they occur in the early Upaniṣads, but they are found elsewhere, for example in Jainism and Buddhism, where they are referred to by different terms and are often specific meditations on the cycle of rebirth. They spread through Buddhism over large parts of Asia first and of the world now. There is no general agreement about what meditation is and what it is not, but in some senses it is monotheistic and probably universal. It is not something to be discussed in the present context. What is the Vedic context?

The kinds of meditation that concern us are connected with almost all the topics we have treated in the previous chapters and the present. Vedic meditation is the product of a long process of *interiorization*. It started when a fire ritual, the Agnihotra, was interiorized by performing it through breathing. Other rituals came to be performed mentally. In the Soma ritual, there is a ‘mental \(*manasā*\) cup’. Mental performances of Vedic rituals enabled the grammarian Patañjali to declare that ritual is without end like language. Meditation is related to the mental chariots and wheels of the beginning of Chapter 2 and to the Rathakāra, but ritual when interiorized, chant when inaudible, recitation when ineffable and breathing itself, all turned into forms of meditation in later Vedic where they are looked upon as *karma*, that is: an activity. Why? Because they have a beginning and an end. They are not knowledge which is instantaneous, beyond time. But what sounds as recitation or meditation may be knowledge, e.g., of *pūr*ṇ*am*, ‘fullness’. We return to such exceptions in Chapter 14.

The Sāmavedic CU begins with speculations about the *udgītha* chant which culminates in OM. OM unites Rig and Sāman as man and woman unite and satisfy each other’s desires. OM unites A, U and M. Its foundation is ‘the most natural order of sound production: an opening of the mouth followed by its closure’ \(Roman Jakobson\).

Elsewhere the CU meditation \(*dhyāna*\) is one of a long chain of realities, each greater than the preceding one. The Praśna Upaniṣad declares that meditation on the sound A leads to a speedy return to earth; AU jointly together leads to the lunar world, but only AUM leads to the world of brahman \(*brahmaloka*\)—a variation on the traditional doctrine of the paths of the ancestors and that of the gods. The section ends with a corrupt verse or versified speculation:
>
> With Rig stanzas this world;

> With Yajus formulas, the mid-regions;

> With Sāman chants, the poets’ proclaimed place.

> By the support of OM alone does a man attain

> that which is serene, beyond old age

> and death, free from fear, the supreme.

There is no mention of knowledge in these rambling verses. The Chāndogya is close to the Sāmaveda, especially at the beginning where chanting takes precedence over meditation or knowledge. In later sections, the CU and the BĀU draw from ‘the common stock of Upaniṣadic lore’ \(as Patrick Olivelle put it\) and concentrate on knowledge. In Buddhism, meditation had a great future, but it was topped by wisdom which corresponds to the Upaniṣadic knowledge \(Chapter 16, *Sixteen: Buddhism*\). In the middle and later Upaniṣads, knowledge is gradually replaced by epic and religious notions such as salvation and bhakti. The search for salvation signals the Vedānta or end of the Veda.

Another signal of the approaching end is the breakdown of the notion of Vedic school or *śākhā*. I have quoted freely from the CU, the BĀU and other Upaniṣads which belong to different schools. I did not jump around to such an extent in earlier chapters. The breakdown of the schools is not mentioned explicitly in the Upaniṣads, as far as I know, but it is found in other developments during the same period. In grammar, the position of the earlier *Prātiśakhyā* \(‘one for each *śākhā*’\) treatises is eclipsed by Pāṇini’s grammar which is applicable to all, that is, to the Sanskrit language as a whole \(Chapter 14\). There is an echo in the Vedānta or Brahma Sūtra which states that meditation belongs to all schools and is not *prativedam*, ‘one for each Veda’.
