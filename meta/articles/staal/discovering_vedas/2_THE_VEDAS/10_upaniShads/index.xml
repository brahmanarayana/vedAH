      <description>The Vedic or Classical Upaniṣads are sometimes called Vedānta or ‘End (anta) of the Veda’. The term occurs first after the end of the Vedic period, in the Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad (fourth to third centuries BCE?), when the Upaniṣads were looked upon as a separate group and it was felt that the ritualistic Veda had reached its ‘end’, the English word that is not only etymologically related to Sanskrit anta but has its same double connotation: the final portion of a thing, and also its goal, ultimate aim or destination.</description>

      <description>The most celebrated Upaniṣadic speaker and philosopher was Yājñavalkya. The debate, recorded or imagined by the composer of the BĀU, took an unexpected turn when he was asked by Ārthabhāga what happens when a man dies. He took a number of steps and his first question was: Where does the breath of a dead person go? Yājñavalkya gave the kind of down-to-earth answer that is typical of him: ‘His breaths do not depart of him.</description>

      <description>The Upaniṣads are not all like the famous dialogue between Yājñavalkya and Ārthabhāga. They continue from the Brāhmaṇas and Āraṇyakas and contain, therefore, the usual mixture of pearls and dung. A striking specimen of the latter is crisply formulated by the CU (1.3.3):
The interval between exhalation and inhalation is suspended breath. Suspended breath is language.
I am not familiar with any theory of language that is more succinct than this.</description>

      <description>We have encountered several meanings of brahman. It means sublime ‘language’ in the early Rigveda and the brahman priest is an officiant attached to the Atharvaveda. In the Upaniṣads, brahman is something entirely different. It cannot be easily defined and its frequent translation as ‘absolute’ does not contradict the fact that it must sometimes be translated as ‘language’. The word ātman is even more intractable. Etymologically related to an Indo-European word for ‘breath’ (German Athem, Dutch adem), it is used in Vedic and Sanskrit as a reflexive pronoun for all three genders and persons, as in English: ‘he did it himself’, ‘they went out by themselves’, ‘the book itself says so’.</description>

      <description>Whether or not we are brahman and whether or not the ethical dimensions of the karma doctrine are Upaniṣadic, the karma doctrine is related to something else that is Indic and goes beyond it: techniques of concentration or meditation (dhyāna, abhidhyāna). They are Vedic because they occur in the early Upaniṣads, but they are found elsewhere, for example in Jainism and Buddhism, where they are referred to by different terms and are often specific meditations on the cycle of rebirth.</description>

      <description>If I were asked to point at the greatest contributions of the Upaniṣads and the Vedānta, I would mention two. The first is public discussions and rational dialogues without restraints (e.g., ‘political correctness’). Rational discussions never existed between the two Jaina sects, who did not talk to each other, but survived in Indian philosophy, in the Buddhist Councils, in the Council of Lhasa that allegedly took place between Indian and Chinese Buddhists, and among Tibetans, though no longer in Tibet itself.</description>
