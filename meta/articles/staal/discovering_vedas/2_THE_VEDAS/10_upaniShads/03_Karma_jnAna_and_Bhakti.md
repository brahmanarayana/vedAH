The Upaniṣads are not all like the famous dialogue between Yājñavalkya and Ārthabhāga. They continue from the Brāhmaṇas and Āraṇyakas and contain, therefore, the usual mixture of pearls and dung. A striking specimen of the latter is crisply formulated by the CU \(1.3.3\):
>
> The interval between exhalation and inhalation is suspended breath. Suspended breath is language.

I am not familiar with any theory of language that is more succinct than this. Armand Minard, the greatest expert of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa since Eggeling, paid it a kind of compliment which I translate from the French:
>
> If this passage assimilates phonation and suspended breath, it is not a sign of ignorance but an esotericism that moves within a circle of thought that is closed to vulgar knowledge even if it is scientific.

Minard does not give an example of a scientific insight from within that esoteric circle of thought, but the explanation lies undoubtedly in Sāmavedic chants and other similar recitations that have to be sung without taking breath. This is not easy as may be gathered from the transcriptions I have given in Chapter 6 which do not mark where breath is taken. I measured the length of the initial ‘o’ of several chants: the average is 18 seconds. During such an interval of suspended breath, I would have plenty of time to do some talking—more than enough to serve as a foundation for a succinct theory of language.

Fortunately, large sections of the Upaniṣads are pervaded by a current of fresh air that is different from anything found in earlier Vedic. The only exceptions, which sometimes surpass them, are the speculative poems of the late Rigveda. They were composed further west a few centuries before the earliest Upaniṣads.

If I were forced to generalize about the differences between the immediately preceding Brāhmaṇas and the Upaniṣads, I would say that *karma* or ‘ritual’ is to the Brāhmaṇas what *jñāna* or ‘knowledge’ is to the Upaniṣads. It does not contradict Yājñavalkya’s praise of *karma* as moral activity so let me try to be a little bit more precise.

The term *karma* means many things. It always refers to some kind of activity but in the Brāhmaṇas it refers primarily to ritual activity. The Upaniṣads teach that humans are bound by ritual and freed by knowledge. The embarrassment with regard to mantras and ritual that we encountered in the previous chapter, gives way in the Upaniṣads to a radical denunciation of ritual and an impassioned plea for pure knowledge that confirms their *Vedic* nature and would be an adornment to any institute of higher learning.

My simplistic explanation of the distinction between Brāhmaṇas and Upaniṣads in terms of *karma* and *jñāna* is inspired by the Bhagavad Gītā \(BG\), which was itself inspired by the Upaniṣads. It is called an Upaniṣad in some of its colophons. BG belongs to the epic and is later than the Śvetāśvatara, one of the latest classical Upaniṣads. It would, therefore, be an anachronistic explanation. We have always treated anachronistic explanations with caution, but what exactly is wrong with them?

An anachronistic interpretation is often misleading because it neglects history. Anachronistic interpretations impose modern concepts on ancient ones that have nothing to do with them. To say of the chariot, on which the Aśvins travelled through space, that it was an airplane is a good example. It is based on errors of history, omissions and confusions. Constructing an airplane is based upon a technology that derives from the science of aerodynamics, a discipline that could develop only after Newton had created dynamics. He in turn could not have done so if he had not studied Euclidian geometry and his successors could not have made this effective unless the Arabs had introduced algebra to Europe.

Using the BG to interpret the difference between Brāhmaṇas and Upaniṣads is not as bad because composers of the Upaniṣads would at least understand it—though *bhakti*, to which I return, would be unfamiliar to earlier ones. So let us tread carefully and try to avoid pitfalls.

The BG is helpful because it puts *karma* and *jñāna* in the context of life and death with which everyone is familiar. Arjuna asks Shri Krishna whether he should fight or not. Yes, says Krishna, you must act, that means kill, but you should abandon the fruits of action \(*karma-phala-tyāga*\). The term *tyāga*, ‘abandonment’ reminds us of Vedic ritual where the patron says after each oblation: ‘this is for Agni, not for me’ \(and similarly for other gods\). It is a simple rite and the patron does not give up the fruits, but merely the ownership of the substance of his oblation. Outside ritual, abandonment of attachment to the fruits of action is difficult as Arjuna is about to discover. Shri Krishna helps him by placing his dilemma in a wider perspective. There are, he says, three ‘ways’: *karmayoga*, *jñānayoga* and *bhaktiyoga*.

About *karma* and *jñāna*, the Gītā says many different things. Discipline of action \(*karma-yoga*\) is better than renunciation of action \(5.2\). But knowledge is better than ritual \(4.33\), a statement that summarizes the message of the Upaniṣads and their reaction to the Brāhmaṇas and Āraṇyakas. The BG is not a philosophical treatise attempting consistency. It is a devotional work. But it is clear in the long run that it prefers to *karma* and *jñāna*, *bhakti* or ‘loving devotion’ which does not occur in the Vedas. *Bhakti* makes its first appearance in Upaniṣads such as the Śvetāśvatara and Muṇḍaka, probably composed during the last few centuries BCE. The Śvetāśvatara refers to the grace of god. It is a god who is ‘higher than *Brahman*’ and known as ‘the Lord’. It also refers to ‘one Rudra who has not tolerated a second’ \(recall that, in Chapter 8, Kautsa noted that this Vedic statement contradicts another\). These theistic tendencies came to the fore in later Indic sects or religions and have always been predominant in the monotheistic religions of western Asia. The Rigveda contains nothing like it. It is hardly the same thing when the Bharadvājas, composers of the sixth circle say to Agni: ‘You are our dear guest\!’

The Gītā’s juxtaposition of ritual and knowledge pays no attention to difficulties that philosophers have raised. The two paths are not easily compatible and *karma-phala-tyāga* is not the same as *jñāna*. Early Indic philosophies tried to find and analyse a similar synthesis which they called: *karma-jñāna-samuccaya*. It is a good point of departure for beginning students of Indian philosophy. Śaṇkara tried to solve the difficulty by declaring that *karma* and *jñāna* are intended for different classes of persons.

To illustrate the Upaniṣadic critique of ritual at its best we should not look at early Upaniṣads like the CU or BĀU, which display sparkling new ideas but conform elsewhere to the ritualism of the Brāhmaṇas and Āraṇyakas. Such Upaniṣads do not even go as far as a poet in the last circle of the Rigveda:
>
> You will not find him who has created

> Some obstacle is in your way.

> Enveloped by mists and stammering

> Taking life, the reciters wander.

Later Upaniṣads are more radical, e.g., the Muṇḍaka \(with parallels in the Kaṭha and Maitri\):
>
> Unsteady boats are these ritual forms, eighteen in number, in which the inferior karma is said to reside. The fools who delight in this ritual as the highest good go again and again through the cycle of old age and death. Abiding in the midst of ignorance, wise in their own estimate, fancying themselves to be learned but really obtuse, these fools go around in a circle like blind men led by the blind.

The Muṇḍaka is not only radical, it uses a more vernacular form of Sanskrit. That shows that it was popular, not that it was influenced by Jainism or Buddhism, traditions that were first expressed through the medium of a Middle-Indic language. All are critical of ritual, but the Upaniṣadic critique paves the way for *jñāna* and specifies what *jñāna* is knowledge *of*. *Jñāna* is *brahma-jñāna*, ‘knowledge of the absolute,’ the somewhat opaque but convenient English translation of a principle that holds the universe together. Other Upaniṣadic passages declare that that *brahman* is identical with our self \(*ātman*\) and that knowledge is its realization. The universe is one and we are part of it in our inner selves. The question is: how? Light is thrown on this question by a recent discovery.
