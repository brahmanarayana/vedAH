### Towards Universality

It is often maintained that progress is a Western notion. But the term ‘Western’ is as misleading as ‘Eastern’ or ‘Oriental’. I discovered this in California when I noted that Japan was not in the east but in the west. All such terms are subjective: they throw no light on the locality of the user and provide no information about the locality of the place to which they refer. Unlike ‘Western,’ *progress* says something about what happens or does not happen in the world. The Vedas do not mention progress, but did not regard themselves as ‘eternal’ or ‘of non-human origin’ \(*apauru*ṣ*eya*\), ideas that originated in the post-Vedic philosophy of the Mīmāṃsā. They depict their human composers, tell us stories about their eventful lives and describe developments that take place around them. It is I who is asking: did they make progress within that long Vedic period which lasted from ca. 1700 to 450 BCE?

The Rigveda starts from the smallest social unit, the family. It exhibits everything that is clannish: tightly-knit links, atavistic beliefs, close and exclusive attachments to the tribe, to local poets and leaders. All seek wealth, success, long lives and sons. In the later Rigveda there emerge great speculative poems. They are almost contemporary with the earliest Upaniṣads which, though secret by definition, became most widely known. In that development, the Sāmaveda remained mysterious and the Yajurveda played a conservative role. But the breakdown of the schools and the emergence of the classical Upaniṣads depict the movement of a civilization towards universality.

That universality is incompatible with a narrowing religious outlook. That is one of the reasons I have stressed from the beginning that the Vedas are not a religion. They are a civilization.

A narrowing religious outlook and intolerance are two sides of the same coin. Examples abound. At the time of writing, Pope Benedict XVI declared: ‘Catholic faith obliges us to hold that souls are immediately created by God.’ It is implied that soul means: human soul, i.e. humans have souls, but animals do not. Composers of the Vedas also had wide-ranging opinions. But they never doubted that there is a gradual transition from animal to human. It is in accordance with the mounting evidence from evolutionary biology. Those who close their eyes to that evidence live in a dream.

The phrase ‘narrowing religious outlook’ comes from Jawaharlal Nehru. He may or may not have been thinking of Rigvedic poetry when he wrote about the Upaniṣads: ‘We cannot go back to that old pantheistic outlook, and yet perhaps we may still sense the mystery of nature, listen to her song of life and beauty, and draw vitality from her.’ Nehru’s lament was perhaps in part an expression of the longing of a great statesman for his native Kashmir. He then went further: ‘We have to get rid of that narrowing religious outlook, that obsession with the supernatural and metaphysical speculations, that loosening of the mind’s discipline in religious ceremonial and mystical emotionalism, which comes in the way of our understanding ourselves and the world.’ That description applies to post-Vedic Upaniṣads and religions when the meaning of *veda* as knowledge was simply forgotten.

The notion of intolerance is not applicable to mantras or ritual. Stobhas such as *ī*ḍ*ā* and *ilā* belong to different schools, but that has nothing to do with dichotomies such as true/false or right/wrong. Even Baudhāyana holds the left palm up and the right palm down on a bundle of grass during the *nihnava* ceremony, because he is a Taittirīyaka Yajurvedin, whereas a Kauṣītaki Rigvedin does it the other way round during the same ceremony. The actual differences are as minuscule and insignificant as the differences between religious sects; but reciters of mantras, chanters of songs or ritualists do not kill each other.

The simple and simplistic observations that I have offered in this section on the Vedic way toward universality are not idle observations on a topic that belongs to a distant past. They take us right to the present. Dreams of paradise are no longer harmless; they have turned into violence. Looking in all directions, we must unite, save life and protect our poor Gaia in so far as it can still be done. Vedic nomads destroyed many forests but the Vedas are on our side.



### The Powers of Language

We have seen that the greatest contributions of the Indian sciences were in the understanding of language. To grasp their origins, we have to go back further than the Prātiśākhyas, the Padapāṭha and the Sound Pattern of Language to the Rigveda where the earliest meaning of *bráhman* was ‘sublime language’. It is connected with one god, Bṛhaspati, and two goddesses, Vāc and Sarasvatī, barely touched upon in my account so far. I have not neglected the sounds of language or linguistics, but never tried to derive a general conclusion from all that is said with respect to these topics in the Veda.

‘Speech’ is the traditional translation and interpretation of *bráhman* as well as *vāc*. The correct translation is *language*. In modern usage, the two are clearly distinguished. Speech is what we say; it is a manifestation of language which is an innate faculty of the mind. In Indian studies it is often said and written that ‘speech’ is regarded as a transcendental power in the Vedas and Vedānta, Mīmāṃsā, Sāṃkhya-Yoga, the philosophy of grammar and Kashmir Śaivism; but as conventional and arbitrary in the Cārvāka and in early Buddhism. The Vedas, however, do not call *vāc* ‘transcendental’ \(*paramārtha*\). They regard it as the direct manifestation of thought or mind \(*manas*\). That applies, to language but not to speech which is often mindless. We have already come across important uses of *manasā*, ‘with’ or ‘in the mind.’ The Vedic Indians imported chariots into the subcontinent *manasā* \(Chapter 2\). Sanskrit *manas* is etymologically related to English *mind.* That does not prove much, but helps to clear the jungle and ‘mind’ is relatively clear in modern usage.

The Rigveda devotes two hymns to *vāc*. One is ‘a paean of self-praise’ as Wendy Doniger calls it. The other, RV 10.71, begins with the verse:
>
> Bṛhaspati\! When they \(the first poets and seers\) set in motion the first beginning of language \(*vāc*\), setting up names, what had been hidden in them as their best and purest good became manifest through love.

> Where the sages fashioned language with their thought \(*vāc manasā*\), filtering it like parched grain through a sieve, friends recognized their friendships. Their beauty was marked on the language.

We should make a correction in the first verse, not an emendation but a reminder. Language does not consist of names. It is an old error, found across the globe. The ancient Chinese, Greeks and Hebrews accepted it as did the Vedas as we see here—though not without serious qualification. Perhaps the phrase ‘setting up names’ \(*nāmadheya*ṃ *dadhānā*ḥ\) escaped from the heart of the poet involuntarily, like a seed that falls from a blossom and is carried through the wind until it settles down somewhere.

Why does language not consist of names and why is ‘naming’ not the first step of language? Because names are only a subclass of words and words are only a small part of language which consists of sentences, syntax, semantics, grammar and is linked with thought—*vāc manasā*—as the second verse says. All these things were known throughout the Vedic period and brought to perfection by the Sanskrit grammarians and all the Indic linguists that followed—touched upon in Chapters 11, 12 and 14.

In the second verse, the phrase ‘filtering it like parched grain through a sieve’ evokes the filtering of the Soma beverage.

The Rigveda links language not only to ‘thought’ but also to ‘vision’ \(*dh*ī\), a word from which comes *dhyāna*, ‘meditation’ in one of its later meanings. Like *vāc manasā,* ‘language from thought’, *manasā dhī,* ‘vision from thought’, is a common expression. Elsewhere the inspiration of the poets is expressed by *vip*, related to English ‘vibration’, which evokes the shaman who trembles under the influence of his or her vision. Since language originates from thought, vision, love, the heart and the self, its understanding is difficult, says the Rigveda; therefore: ‘he who studies understands, not the one who sleeps.’

Fascination with *vāc* did not stop with the Rigveda for its powers are great. In the Chāndogya Upaniṣad, Uddālaka discusses cause and effect, like when clay is transformed into a pot. He says: ‘the effect is *vāc-ārambhanam*’ which means: ‘it originates from language.’ This is not correct in the case of the pot, which is different from clay also in shape, as later Indic philosophers observed; but it is true in other cases, for example in *speech acts*, where the appropriate authority who pronounces the words: ‘I unite you in marriage’ has not merely said something. He has caused two people to be married to each other as we have seen in Chapter 11.

The powers of language enable us not only to communicate with each other, but to talk about the world and express our feelings and ideas. Our languages divide us but enable us at the same time to go into great detail about an infinite number of topics. In that respect human language is more powerful than the systems of communication used by non-human animals though the transitions—very controversial for the time being—are likely to be gradual. It is a large topic upon which we have touched in Chapters 11 and 12.

The powers of language are a favourite topic of philosophers but only those who have a specialized knowledge of the topic seem to have been able to arrive at valuable insights. According to Bhartṛhari \(fifth century CE\), a philosopher as well as a linguist, there is no knowledge without language. Earlier he made a different observation: language is no guarantee of truth, it is an imagined construction of being, ‘a mismatch for reality’ as Saroja Bhate expressed it. It follows that reality cannot be understood by using ordinary language. Bhartṛhari sought clarification in a Vedic scheme of four levels of language that had a great future in Indic speculation. I shall discuss it in the next section, but one thing is clear. Seers come at the top, what humans speak comes at the bottom.

I am sure that similar ideas have been expressed by poets, thinkers, mystics and writers in other civilizations. What distinguishes the development that started in the Vedas from others is its close association with the sciences of language. It has empirical foundations. I am familiar with two more recent scientists whose insights were not only similarly profound, but equally well informed about language. One is Wilhelm von Humboldt \(1767–1835\), whose numerous works include three volumes on the language of Java. Especially famous and influential, and often obscure, is its 300-page *Introduction* entitled ‘The Diversity of Human Language-Structure and its Influence on the Mental Development of Mankind’. The other is Roman Jakobson \(1896–1982\), who was equally prolific and combined not only a professorship at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology \(MIT\) with one at Harvard University, but linguistics, literature, poetics, semantics and Slavic studies—all topics on which he expressed himself not only forcefully but with great clarity. The insights of these two giants display the same breadth and depth as the Vedic and it is clear that the latter will play an increasingly important role in any future science and philosophy of language.



### The Limitations of Language

We return from having sat, briefly, at the feet of three gurus: Bhartṛhari, Wilhelm von Humboldt and Roman Jakobson. The third expressed himself most clearly, but only Bhartṛhari seems to have had an understanding of what the present section is about. This is because he was inspired by the Rigveda. It was there that he found awareness of the limitations of language and of what language may *not* be able to express. It is a necessary component of the richness of language studies that I tried to call up from afar in previous sections.

Poets and thinkers of the Rigveda regarded language as an expression of their greatest good. But it has limitations which are described in an apparent riddle \(RV 1.164\). It is a long poem, consisting of fifty-two verses. The one that concerns us here is verse 10. It puts language, *vāc*, at the top of the universe where it ‘knows all, but does not move all.’ ‘Knowing all’ is expressed by the compound *viśva-vid*. The ‘moving’ is part of another, more difficult compound: *viśvaminvām.* The *viśva* is easy or is it *viśvam*? How do we analyse the compound, that is: where does the *m* go? The Padapāṭha understood it: the *m* goes with the second part. Sāyaṇa follows and interprets the rare verb *minv*- as ‘being busy’, not too different from the ‘moving’ of most modern translators. A similar expression occurs in the Atharvaveda.

Verse 10 suggests that many speakers of language do not know what they are talking about. Probably true, but we would hope that it means more than that. We have to wait for verse 45 which finally explains:
>
> Language is divided into four parts

> Which the inspired brahmans know.

> Three parts are hidden in secret; they do not circulate.

> The fourth part of language is what humans speak.

Here is the foursome to which Bhartṛhari referred. It is not immediately perspicuous because it seems to be a riddle; but Vedic ‘riddles’ or ‘puzzles’ are not mysterious. They have a key, and once it is found, everything falls in place.

A simple example of a straightforward solution to such a puzzle is the first verse of the same poem: Rigveda 1.164.1. It says: ‘Of this beloved Hotṛ priest, grown grey, the middle brother is hungry. The third brother carries clarified butter on his back. Here I saw the lord of the people with his seven sons.’ The solution is: the ritual arena \(Figure 15\). The three brothers are the three altars. The middle one is hungry because few oblations are made on it. The third one is the offering altar on which oblations of clarified butter are made. At the same time, it indicates the place where the patron will move with his fire and settle down with what is hoped for: a large family.

The lowest of the four parts of language in Rigveda 1.164.45 is the simplest. The more mysterious higher levels shine forth clearly, provided we understand the uses of some of the many technical or semi-technical terms and concepts that we have met in earlier chapters. These are not later than 1.164 which maybe assigned to the tenth century BCE

One of these terms is *anirukta* which I translated as ‘ineffable’ for lack of a better term. It properly refers to the unintelligible ritual chants of the Sāmaveda \(Chapter 6\). The famous composer of 1.164, Dīrghatamas, ‘Seeing Far into Darkness’, must have known that the Sāmavedins set verse of the Rigveda to their own melodies and expressed some phrases in a different language which consisted of *stobha* ‘embellishments’. The term *anirukta* is used in similar contexts, including language as *bráhman*. Another term is *anirvacanīya*, ‘which cannot be expressed,’ said of the world and also used in Advaita Vedānta.

Though we may take our cue from the Sāmaveda embellishments, the broad category of mantras illustrates the deficiencies of ordinary speech in a different manner. For if it were the case that natural language could do what mantras do, their would be no need for them. I have not been able to state precisely what mantras can and cannot do \(Chapter 11\). They are syntactically similar to bird song which, according to some experts, ‘defies explanation’. We know about mantras even less than about bird song or human language. All are unknown like the depths of the ocean as it appeared to Albert Einstein standing on the beach, trying to see far into the darkness.

Mantras, like sāmans, must belong to the higher levels of the hierarchy of Rigveda 1.164.45. They have been discussed in chapters 6, 7, and 11, especially *Eleven: Mantras*, some are *upā*ṃ*śu*, ‘articulated \(within the mouth\) but inaudible’, sometimes, less technically, rendered as ‘indistinct’. As for rites, some are performed without mantras, that is *tūṣṇīm*, ‘in silence’. Examples are not needed but I shall make some space for them here for the reader to ponder:

![image](images/000002.jpg)

Before the reader exclaims: ‘I know all that mystical stuff\!’ let me explain why it is significant in our context. It is undeniable that mystics all over the world have used similar expressions. But there is an important difference between worldwide expressions of mystic intuitions and the Vedic tradition. The latter couches these limitations of language in a language that is itself precise and scientific—a metalanguage, in fact—because it rides the waves of well-developed scientific disciplines such as the sciences of ritual and language. They put the equally inaudible and unintelligible mutterings of mystics in other parts of the world in the dim light where they belong.

I conclude that our ordinary, natural language is unable to express all that is true about the universe. But now we have also arrived at an explanation for the miraculous appearance and development of artificial languages in India at a much earlier date than anywhere else. Such insights were already available in the Rigveda. Higher levels than the ordinary fourth that humans speak incorporated not only mantras, but left vacant spaces large enough to be filled by artifical expressions and other forms of language.

If we look at Europe, we are struck by the firmly entrenched resistance to strange and artificial symbols. It was first directed at the Indic numerals which were introduced by Fibonacci and, immediately, presented problems of assimilation. Should they be written within texts or in separate boxes outside them? One solution was to simply outlaw them, which occurred as late as the seventeenth century CE in Sweden. The ‘barbarous’ algebra of the Arabs had already been rejected by Descartes, Newton and others. Only Leibniz understood it. Resistance to artificial languages survives in the third millennium in the minds of ‘ordinary language’ philosophers who believe that they can and should be translated into natural language which is one thing they cannot be.

Scientists know that progress in science does not depend on natural language but proceeds from equations. It holds for the artificial expressions of Pāṇini’s metalanguage of linguistics, for Newton’s apparently simple formula *f = ma* which was due to Euler—the original having been in Latin, for Maxwell’s differential equations, for *E = mc*2 and all the equations of theoretical physics together with the less formidable ones used in numerous other disciplines, from econometrics to DNA genetics. The Ultimate Theory, the theory of everything if there will be one, will be ‘a finite set of marks on paper’ as Freeman Dyson put it.

I am not claiming that these marks occur on some of the three levels of language that are hidden according to the Rigveda. The composers of the Vedas had no idea about these matters but they were not held back by a behaviouristic or phenomenologic, ‘scientistic’ outlook and left ample space for a great variety of other languages to develop.

What can we learn from it? That our language, the characteristic of our species, is mysterious and has profound limitations of which we know little. Our understanding of the world and of ourselves necessarily suffers from these limitations. There is hope if we are willing to let languages expand.



### Conclusions
>
> *anupāsitavṛddhānāṃvidyā nātiprasīdati*

> ‘Science does not smile on those who neglect the ancients.’

> Bhartṛhari

Vedic sciences and insights paved the way for the sciences of ritual and language. Both took account of the relevant facts and exhibited theoretical sophistication which included the uses of an artificial language. It is not easy to judge the merits of their insights. What we can say is that contemporary scientists working on language and the cognitive sciences have amassed vast amounts of information and reached deep insights of which their Vedic colleagues could have had no inkling. Did some of their insights go beyond present understandings? Can their ideas on *upā*ṃ*śu*, *aniruktagāna*, *tūṣṇīm*, breathing, mantras and the rest be understood and explained by other types of modern scientists—physiologists, neurologists and others as yet unborn?

The Vedic perspective on language took account of levels about which we seem to know little. Mantras, in particular, spanning the divide between ritual and language, have hardly been studied in a scientific spirit. Nothing is known about, say, mantras and aphasia. Our distant predecessors had a different perspective and were familiar with different facts about the human mind. Their knowledge may be as valuable as that of our successors in the future.

Due respect to the ancients should, of course, be based upon rational standards and stay away from politics. Governments have expressed opinions and made decisions they are not competent to make. In India, they have declared that ‘whatever is very ancient in India, that precisely is most modern for the world.’ In the USA, they have claimed that ‘intelligent design’ is another form of science. Such declarations show that these dignitaries are not familiar with the sciences and insights their institutions are supposed to embody. It demonstrates that *elementary* education, in important parts of even the ‘developed’ world, has sunk to dangerously low levels. If that continues, it will not affect the past but the future of sciences and insights, and, therefore, the future of the species, the environment and life on earth.
