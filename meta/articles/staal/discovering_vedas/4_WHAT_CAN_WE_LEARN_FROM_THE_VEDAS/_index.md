Analysis and Discovery

*Part IV combines two topics that appear to be different. The first is concerned with the Vedic Sciences, a well-defined set. The second examines a small number of insights that I call ‘Vedic Insights’. The latter may be related to the Vedic Sciences but, like numerous other disciplines, they do not conform to the scheme that distinguishes between ‘exact’, ‘human’, ‘life’ and ‘social’ sciences.*

*Whereas the Vedic Sciences are often outdated and superseded by later developments, the Vedic Insights seem to show that there are things that the composers of the Vedas knew but we do not. It supports what we do know: many topics are beyond our present understanding of the universe and all that it contains.*
