title = "09 Notations and Artificial Languages"

+++

The third Vedic science of language as I have reconstructed it may be looked upon as a methodology but its significance is wider. The Prātiśākhyas introduced, along with rules and metarules, the beginnings of the metalinguistic study of language. To see what that means we should start with some simple facts about rules. Many rules of language are of the form ‘A > B’. This may be read as ‘A becomes B’ or ‘B is substituted for A.’ ‘A > B’ is a modern artificial notation. The Prātiśākhyas did not use variables such as ‘A’ and ‘B’ or expressions such as ‘\+’ and ‘>’, but other artificial notations. Their rules made metalinguistic use of the case endings of the object language, that is, Vedic. Thus two expressions, distinguished in English as ‘becoming’ and ‘substitution,’ correspond to a single artificial expression:
>
> A \+ Nominative ending, B \+ Accusative ending.

In order to apply this metarule or *paribhāṣā*, we have to treat the element ‘A’ as if it were a Sanskrit word of the object language and attach the Nominative ending to it. Similarly for ‘B’ and the Accusative ending. We met with an example on *Fourteen: Sūtra: Vedic Sciences*: *takāro le lam*. The beginning of the Padapāṭha of Chapter 4 alluded to a case that is a little more interesting: two rules operate on three elements in order to explain \(in modern notation\):
>
> ā *\+ uru \+ aprā*ḥ *> orvaprā*ḥ.

The two rules are \(again in modern notation\):
>
> ā *\+ uru > oru* and:

> *oru \+ aprā*ḥ *> orvaprā*ḥ.

The question is in which order should they be applied.

I mentioned this case only in order to illustrate the level of sophistication we meet with in the Prātiśākhyas. They introduced other technicalities and artificial expressions. They did not combine into a full-fledged artificial language such as was created by Pāṇini for his grammar of the spoken language. His orientation was different but he stood on the shoulders of the Prātiśākhyas, other Vedic sciences of language and other early grammars.

There is more to Vedic linguistics but it is a technical topic and one should know some Vedic or Sanskrit to make it palatable. As it stands, our topics illustrate that Vedic linguistics led not only to the foundation of the science of language, but to the concept and formation of an artificial language. It shows in passing that artificial languages are not only found in sciences such as mathematics or physics and in modern civilization, but exist across sciences and civilizations.
