      <description>Science is universal, but the concept of science varies in different cultures. English science is different from French science, German Wissenschaft, Japanese gaku, Russian nauka, etc. English science refers to what it regards as the ‘exact’ sciences, viz., mathematics, physics and other so-called ‘natural sciences’. The French and the other quoted terms include human, life, social and other sciences. They are all exact in that they strive for explicitness and avoid contradictions.</description>

      <description>The Vedic sciences are not objects that moderns are at liberty to make up. Much is known about them and what we know is in accordance with a traditional classification of sciences that belong to the late Vedic period. This was anticipated by a more adventurous or generous list in the early Chāndogya Upaniṣad (7.1.1–4). It uses the term vidyā which is closely related to veda, both meaning ‘knowledge’. The Chāndogya passage starts with sage Nārada asking Sanatkumāra, ‘Eternal Youth,’ to teach him what he knows.</description>

      <title>03 The Science of Ritual</title>

      <description>Following the order of the ‘limbs of the Veda,’ we begin with the science of ritual. It deals with many more scientific concepts than the notion of ritual evokes in a modern mind. There is nothing in modern science that corresponds to such a discipline unless it is directly inspired by it, like Hubert and Mauss. It is a science because it provides systematic and highly confirmed knowledge of ritual structures such as self-embedding and other forms of recursiveness mentioned or alluded to in Chapters 11 and 12.</description>

      <description>Vedic geometry is attached to ritual because it is concerned with the measurement and construction of ritual enclosures (such as the ritual arena of Figure 15) and of altars (Figures 21–22). Our knowledge is based to a small extent upon the living tradition, but more complete information survives in the Śulba Sūtras. The most important are Baudhāyana, Āpastamba and Mānava, which are attached to Śrauta Sūtras of the Black Yajurveda, and Kātyāyana which is attached to the White.</description>

      <title>05 Numbers and Infinity</title>

      <description>We have so far looked at ‘Vedic geometry’, but is there no other mathematics in the Vedas? Though the term is used in several senses, there certainly is no trace of algebra. What about those very large numbers that we have come across (in Chapter 7) and what about the concept of infinity which is almost omnipresent in some form or other? I offer two observations, one speculative which takes us to a distant past, another factual which takes us to more recent times.</description>

      <description>A few paragraphs should be added about the book Vedic Mathematics by Bharati Krishna Tirtha Maharaja (1884–1960), former Śaṇkarācārya of the Govardhana Maṭha at Puri and published long after his death. (A Śaṇkarācārya is pontiff of one of the four or five traditional schools of the Advaita Vedānta, founded by the original Śaṇkara according to tradition.) A Hindi edition of Vedic Mathematics, called Vaidika Gaṇitā, and a revised English edition, published in Delhi in 1992, were reprinted many times in the following years.</description>

      <title>07 The Prātiśākhyas and the Padapāṭha</title>

      <description>The classification of sciences as ‘limbs of the Veda’ with which we began includes four sciences of language. I shall try to simplify, reconstruct their salient features differently and treat them in three sections. The first examines the Prātiśākhyas and the Padapāṭha with which we are already familiar from Chapter 4.
The Prātiśākhyas are attached to each of the Vedic schools (śākhā) as their name indicates. It will be helpful, therefore, to caste another glance at Table 1 on Four: The Four Vedas.</description>

      <title>08 The Sound Pattern of Language</title>

      <description>The second Vedic science of language as I have reconstructed it led to a major empirical discovery with profound implications for the methodology of linguistics. It was made by Vedic reciters who were engaged in composing Prātiśākhyas and constructing Padapāṭhas or were already familiar with them; and arrived at in stages during roughly the same period. Because the reciters did not think of changes in the Vedic language—what we interpret as such, for example, in the distinction between early, middle and late Vedic (Chapter 4)—they would interpret them as characteristics of different regions (which was often the case).</description>

      <title>09 Notations and Artificial Languages</title>

      <description>The third Vedic science of language as I have reconstructed it may be looked upon as a methodology but its significance is wider. The Prātiśākhyas introduced, along with rules and metarules, the beginnings of the metalinguistic study of language. To see what that means we should start with some simple facts about rules. Many rules of language are of the form ‘A &amp;gt; B’. This may be read as ‘A becomes B’ or ‘B is substituted for A.</description>

      <title>10 Astronomy and Astrology</title>

      <description>The reader need not raise eyebrows about the combination of astrology with astronomy during the Vedic period. It is and has been common all over the world for a long time. The combination occurs in pre-modern and even in early-modern science. Kepler, Tycho Brahe and Newton were all interested in astrology though Newton’s real passion was alchemy. I shall be brief on the entire subject and rely on Michio Yano and the late David Pingree who died on 11 November 2005, when I was struggling with a first version of the present section.</description>
