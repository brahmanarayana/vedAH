title = "10 Astronomy and Astrology"

+++

The reader need not raise eyebrows about the combination of astrology with astronomy during the Vedic period. It is and has been common all over the world for a long time. The combination occurs in pre-modern and even in early-modern science. Kepler, Tycho Brahe and Newton were all interested in astrology though Newton’s real passion was alchemy. I shall be brief on the entire subject and rely on Michio Yano and the late David Pingree who died on 11 November 2005, when I was struggling with a first version of the present section.1

I can do no better than begin by quoting and endorsing the opening phrases of a chapter published by Pingree in 2001:
>
> This is a topic that has elicited for over a century many fanciful and implausible interpretations on the alleged astronomical meaning of the Vedic texts. In this chapter I have tried to avoid such fantasies and to restrict discussion to the overt meanings of passages where the authors of the Vedas clearly are referring to astronomical phenomena or are describing some aspect of astronomical theory.

The Rigvedic contribution to astronomy does not appear to have been very remarkable. It did not distinguish the five planets \(*graha* in later texts\) from the fixed stars. The Vedic term *jyoti*ṣ*ā*, which comes from *jyoti*ḥ, ‘light \(in the sky\)’ or ‘luminary’, is not very distinctive either. That lack of distinction is not altogether surprising. It reflects semi-nomadic origins. Astronomy flourishes in sedentary civilizations which are able to concentrate on the skies from a fixed point and during prolonged periods of time. The Vedic astronomy/astrology may have been conceived in basic outline before the Vedic Indians were settled. It explains that later Indic astronomy was very different.

The main purpose of the *jyoti*ṣ*ā* was the preparation of a calendar in order to fix the dates when rituals have to be performed. The calendar that was arrived at divided the year into 366 days. An adjustment was needed—adding one day about every sixty-four months—in order to preserve the relation between ritual dates and lunar phases. The term *nak*ṣ*atra* in *jyoti*ṣ*ā* was restricted to twenty-seven or twenty-eight groups of stars that were regarded as lunar stations along the ecliptic. In the system of twenty-eight, the distance between the *nak*ṣ*atra*s is irregular. The two systems are also found in Chinese and Islamic astronomy—the former probably an independent development and the latter influenced by the Indic.

Solar and lunar eclipses were famously attributed to a demon who pierced the sun and the moon with darkness. Later called Rahu, then *graha*, literally ‘seizer’, he came to refer to any of the five planets. The demon myth was ridiculed by the astronomer Lalla who wrote in the eighth or ninth century CE: ‘if you are of the opinion that an artful demon causes eclipses by swallowing, then how is it that an eclipse can be determined by calculation?’

Late Vedic texts were not only inspired by Mesopotamian mythology and omens but influenced by Babylonian astronomy. The transmission was facilitated by the establishment of the Achaemenid Empire, which included in the sixth century BCE the Gandhara area on the upper Indus, now part of northern Pakistan. Mathematical astronomy came also from the Near East but that was in the second century CE, more than half a millennium after the Vedic period. It is then that astronomy began to flourish and the five schools called *siddhānta* were established. One of these, the Paitāmaha \(‘ancestral’\) school continued the *vedā*ṇ*ga* tradition, but it disappeared after having been rejected by Varāhamihira \(ca. 550 CE\), a ‘Zoroastrian/Maga Brahman’ allegedly descended from Iranian Magi, who wrote about the five schools: ‘the Pauliśa is accurate, that pronounced by Romaka \(‘Roman’\) is close to it, the Sūrya is more accurate and the remaining two have gone astray.’ Should it be held against Vedic astronomers that they were largely wrong? It is not an uncommon occurrence in the history of science as Āryabhaṭa, al-Bīrūnī and Keppler explained to us in Chapter 9.
