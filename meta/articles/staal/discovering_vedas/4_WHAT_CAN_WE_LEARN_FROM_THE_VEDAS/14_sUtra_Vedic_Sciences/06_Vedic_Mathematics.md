A few paragraphs should be added about the book *Vedic Mathematics* by Bharati Krishna Tirtha Maharaja \(1884–1960\), former Śaṇkarācārya of the Govardhana Maṭha at Puri and published long after his death. \(A Śaṇkarācārya is pontiff of one of the four or five traditional schools of the Advaita Vedānta, founded by the original Śaṇkara according to tradition.\) A Hindi edition of *Vedic Mathematics*, called *Vaidika Ga*ṇ*itā,* and a revised English edition, published in Delhi in 1992, were reprinted many times in the following years. There are also active web-sites and a *Vedic Mathematics Newsletter*.

*Vedic Mathematics* is neither mathematics nor Vedic. It is not *mathematics* unless simple and sometimes fast ways of multiplying, dividing and factorizing numbers, together with other tricks that are playfully explained and appeal to children and unschooled adults, are glorified by that label. It is not *Vedic* unless we follow His Holiness who wrote in his *Preface* that it is ‘in the fitness of things’ that the Vedas include Ayurveda \(the science of life or medicine\), Dhanurveda \(archery\), Gandharva Veda \(the science and art of music\) and Sthāpatya Veda \(which deals with architecture, engineering, etc.\); and goes on to explain that his book is based upon an appendix of the Atharvaveda that no one had heard of or seen.

What we have seen is that *Vedic Mathematics* consisted very largely of geometry, in many respects similar to the ancient Greek variety and often going back to Babylonia. In Europe, it lasted until Newton whose *Principia* is still modelled after Euclid. In India, geometry was replaced by trigonometry and algebra almost a millennium before Newton. I did mention the remarkable progress that followed and led to the discovery of infinite power series. *Vedic Mathematics* is not a work of progress. It portrays regress, unadulterated regress.

Some say that introducing *Vedic Mathematics* into the curriculum was a deliberate effort to keep people ignorant and the masses of India backward. If modern India wishes not only to cooperate but also compete with China—and why should she not?—it would be good to give wide publicity to the international conference ‘*Strings 2006*’ that took place in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. Stephen Hawking and 800 theoretical physicists and mathematicians from all over the world were there, discussed the state of the art with each other and addressed an audience not of uneducated dreamers or fanatics, but of 6,000 Chinese graduate students.
