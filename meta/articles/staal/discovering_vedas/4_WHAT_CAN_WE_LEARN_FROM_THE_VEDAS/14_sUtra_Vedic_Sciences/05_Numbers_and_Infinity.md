title = "05 Numbers and Infinity"

+++

We have so far looked at ‘Vedic geometry’, but is there no other mathematics in the Vedas? Though the term is used in several senses, there certainly is no trace of algebra. What about those very large numbers that we have come across \(in Chapter 7\) and what about the concept of infinity which is almost omnipresent in some form or other? I offer two observations, one speculative which takes us to a distant past, another factual which takes us to more recent times.

Starting from integers, we must make a distinction between *ordinals*, which are integers ordered in a series such as 1, 2, 3,…, \(as discussed in Chapter 11\) and *cardinals*, which refer to the number of elements in a set. The identity of cardinals may be known without knowing how many there are. For example, there may be many sheep in my corral and also many coins in the bag of a prospective buyer. If I let the sheep pass one by one through a gate and take out a coin whenever a sheep passes, I may discover that there are as many sheep as there are coins without knowing what is the number of either. Let us say that two sets which contain the same number of elements or members are *equivalent.* The discovery I just made is that the set of sheep and that of coins are equivalent. The set of my hands and that of my feet are equivalent also and so are the numbers of feet of elephants and dogs. The next step is to define a cardinal number as *a set of equivalent sets*. The number ‘2’, for example, is the set of all pairs—hands, feet, eyes, ears, etc. It does not imply that I know that ‘2’ comes after ‘1’ and before ‘3’ in the series of ordinals. Of course, I do know such things about 1, 2 and 3, but if there had been 164 sheep in my corral and 164 coins in the bag, I could have found out their equivalence without knowing that the number is 164. Other cardinals may be defined in the same way.

Does this ring a bell? The reader wil recall the nonsensical equivalences of the Brāhmaṇas of Chapter 7 on which even scholars who spent part of their life translating them have heaped invectives. Renou writes with greater dispassion and probably thinking of *bandhu*: ‘the hidden connections that they try to establish cannot be accepted; it is too visibly the product of the priestly mind.’ The reader will recall one of these litanies: ‘He offers with an oblation ladled up four times, cattle have four feet; thus he wins cattle; the quarters are four; thus he finds support in the quarters.’ Barring ‘sympathetic magic’—a common phrase but hardly an explanation—what is their significance? Do these foursomes of oblations, feet and quarters refer to a set of equivalent sets? Taken together, do they define the number ‘4’? Could that take us back to much more distant times, when our ancestors discovered cardinal numbers or did that happen later? These questions take us beyond the Vedas.

My second observation is about the infinite. It is referred to by several terms throughout the Vedas and is related to the very large numbers of the Yajurveda, etc., that verge on it. The infinite was loved throughout Indic civilization, but abhorred by the ancient Greeks, from Pythagoras onward. It was ultimately very productive in science and led, in the fourteenth century CE, to infinite power series of pi and the trigonometric functions that Indic mathematicians discovered three centuries before Newton and Leibniz, long after the Vedas.

Long before that, the infinite is also found in a poem about *pūrṇam*, ‘fullness’ that occurs or has been inserted in some Upaniṣads. Those who composed it understood the mathematical sense of infinity, i.e. something like the following.

Look at the interval between the integers ‘0’ and ‘1.’ Think of it as a small line segment: /————————/. There are infinitely many points on that segment. Infinitely many of those points, but not all of them, may be represented by *fractions* of the form ‘*m/n*’. This may be shown by cutting the segment into small segments of various sizes. To make it easier, I shall cut it in segments of equal size. We start by cutting the segment in four: /——/——/——/——/ with cuts at ‘1/4’, ‘1/2’ and ‘3/4’. Continue cutting each of those intervals in half, i.e.: ‘1/8’, ‘1/4’, ‘3/8’, ‘1/2’ ‘5/8’, ‘3/4’ and ‘7/8’. This may continue indefinitely. Now return to the interval between ‘0’ and ‘1’ once again and cut it in two pieces, anywhere. The argument we have gone through just now applies to each of the two pieces. It follows that even if we take an infinity away from the segment, an infinity remains:

> *pūrṇasya pūrṇam ādāya pūrṇam evāvaśiṣyate*//

> ‘Fullness is there, fullness is here, fullness from fullness proceeds,

> When fullness is taken from fullness, fullness remains.’
