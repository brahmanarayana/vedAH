      <description>It is often maintained that progress is a Western notion. But the term ‘Western’ is as misleading as ‘Eastern’ or ‘Oriental’. I discovered this in California when I noted that Japan was not in the east but in the west. All such terms are subjective: they throw no light on the locality of the user and provide no information about the locality of the place to which they refer. Unlike ‘Western,’ progress says something about what happens or does not happen in the world.</description>

      <description>We have seen that the greatest contributions of the Indian sciences were in the understanding of language. To grasp their origins, we have to go back further than the Prātiśākhyas, the Padapāṭha and the Sound Pattern of Language to the Rigveda where the earliest meaning of bráhman was ‘sublime language’. It is connected with one god, Bṛhaspati, and two goddesses, Vāc and Sarasvatī, barely touched upon in my account so far.</description>

      <description>We return from having sat, briefly, at the feet of three gurus: Bhartṛhari, Wilhelm von Humboldt and Roman Jakobson. The third expressed himself most clearly, but only Bhartṛhari seems to have had an understanding of what the present section is about. This is because he was inspired by the Rigveda. It was there that he found awareness of the limitations of language and of what language may not be able to express.</description>

‘Science does not smile on those who neglect the ancients.’
Bhartṛhari
Vedic sciences and insights paved the way for the sciences of ritual and language. Both took account of the relevant facts and exhibited theoretical sophistication which included the uses of an artificial language. It is not easy to judge the merits of their insights. What we can say is that contemporary scientists working on language and the cognitive sciences have amassed vast amounts of information and reached deep insights of which their Vedic colleagues could have had no inkling.</description>
