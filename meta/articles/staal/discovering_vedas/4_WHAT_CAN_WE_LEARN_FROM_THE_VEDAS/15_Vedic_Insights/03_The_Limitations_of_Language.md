title = "03 The Limitations of Language"

+++

We return from having sat, briefly, at the feet of three gurus: Bhartṛhari, Wilhelm von Humboldt and Roman Jakobson. The third expressed himself most clearly, but only Bhartṛhari seems to have had an understanding of what the present section is about. This is because he was inspired by the Rigveda. It was there that he found awareness of the limitations of language and of what language may *not* be able to express. It is a necessary component of the richness of language studies that I tried to call up from afar in previous sections.

Poets and thinkers of the Rigveda regarded language as an expression of their greatest good. But it has limitations which are described in an apparent riddle \(RV 1.164\). It is a long poem, consisting of fifty-two verses. The one that concerns us here is verse 10. It puts language, *vāc*, at the top of the universe where it ‘knows all, but does not move all.’ ‘Knowing all’ is expressed by the compound *viśva-vid*. The ‘moving’ is part of another, more difficult compound: *viśvaminvām.* The *viśva* is easy or is it *viśvam*? How do we analyse the compound, that is: where does the *m* go? The Padapāṭha understood it: the *m* goes with the second part. Sāyaṇa follows and interprets the rare verb *minv*- as ‘being busy’, not too different from the ‘moving’ of most modern translators. A similar expression occurs in the Atharvaveda.

Verse 10 suggests that many speakers of language do not know what they are talking about. Probably true, but we would hope that it means more than that. We have to wait for verse 45 which finally explains:
>
> Language is divided into four parts

> Which the inspired brahmans know.

> Three parts are hidden in secret; they do not circulate.

> The fourth part of language is what humans speak.

Here is the foursome to which Bhartṛhari referred. It is not immediately perspicuous because it seems to be a riddle; but Vedic ‘riddles’ or ‘puzzles’ are not mysterious. They have a key, and once it is found, everything falls in place.

A simple example of a straightforward solution to such a puzzle is the first verse of the same poem: Rigveda 1.164.1. It says: ‘Of this beloved Hotṛ priest, grown grey, the middle brother is hungry. The third brother carries clarified butter on his back. Here I saw the lord of the people with his seven sons.’ The solution is: the ritual arena \(Figure 15\). The three brothers are the three altars. The middle one is hungry because few oblations are made on it. The third one is the offering altar on which oblations of clarified butter are made. At the same time, it indicates the place where the patron will move with his fire and settle down with what is hoped for: a large family.

The lowest of the four parts of language in Rigveda 1.164.45 is the simplest. The more mysterious higher levels shine forth clearly, provided we understand the uses of some of the many technical or semi-technical terms and concepts that we have met in earlier chapters. These are not later than 1.164 which maybe assigned to the tenth century BCE

One of these terms is *anirukta* which I translated as ‘ineffable’ for lack of a better term. It properly refers to the unintelligible ritual chants of the Sāmaveda \(Chapter 6\). The famous composer of 1.164, Dīrghatamas, ‘Seeing Far into Darkness’, must have known that the Sāmavedins set verse of the Rigveda to their own melodies and expressed some phrases in a different language which consisted of *stobha* ‘embellishments’. The term *anirukta* is used in similar contexts, including language as *bráhman*. Another term is *anirvacanīya*, ‘which cannot be expressed,’ said of the world and also used in Advaita Vedānta.

Though we may take our cue from the Sāmaveda embellishments, the broad category of mantras illustrates the deficiencies of ordinary speech in a different manner. For if it were the case that natural language could do what mantras do, their would be no need for them. I have not been able to state precisely what mantras can and cannot do \(Chapter 11\). They are syntactically similar to bird song which, according to some experts, ‘defies explanation’. We know about mantras even less than about bird song or human language. All are unknown like the depths of the ocean as it appeared to Albert Einstein standing on the beach, trying to see far into the darkness.

Mantras, like sāmans, must belong to the higher levels of the hierarchy of Rigveda 1.164.45. They have been discussed in chapters 6, 7, and 11, especially *Eleven: Mantras*, some are *upāṃśu*, ‘articulated \(within the mouth\) but inaudible’, sometimes, less technically, rendered as ‘indistinct’. As for rites, some are performed without mantras, that is *tūṣṇīm*, ‘in silence’. Examples are not needed but I shall make some space for them here for the reader to ponder:

Before the reader exclaims: ‘I know all that mystical stuff\!’ let me explain why it is significant in our context. It is undeniable that mystics all over the world have used similar expressions. But there is an important difference between worldwide expressions of mystic intuitions and the Vedic tradition. The latter couches these limitations of language in a language that is itself precise and scientific—a metalanguage, in fact—because it rides the waves of well-developed scientific disciplines such as the sciences of ritual and language. They put the equally inaudible and unintelligible mutterings of mystics in other parts of the world in the dim light where they belong.

I conclude that our ordinary, natural language is unable to express all that is true about the universe. But now we have also arrived at an explanation for the miraculous appearance and development of artificial languages in India at a much earlier date than anywhere else. Such insights were already available in the Rigveda. Higher levels than the ordinary fourth that humans speak incorporated not only mantras, but left vacant spaces large enough to be filled by artifical expressions and other forms of language.

If we look at Europe, we are struck by the firmly entrenched resistance to strange and artificial symbols. It was first directed at the Indic numerals which were introduced by Fibonacci and, immediately, presented problems of assimilation. Should they be written within texts or in separate boxes outside them? One solution was to simply outlaw them, which occurred as late as the seventeenth century CE in Sweden. The ‘barbarous’ algebra of the Arabs had already been rejected by Descartes, Newton and others. Only Leibniz understood it. Resistance to artificial languages survives in the third millennium in the minds of ‘ordinary language’ philosophers who believe that they can and should be translated into natural language which is one thing they cannot be.

Scientists know that progress in science does not depend on natural language but proceeds from equations. It holds for the artificial expressions of Pāṇini’s metalanguage of linguistics, for Newton’s apparently simple formula *f = ma* which was due to Euler—the original having been in Latin, for Maxwell’s differential equations, for *E = mc*2 and all the equations of theoretical physics together with the less formidable ones used in numerous other disciplines, from econometrics to DNA genetics. The Ultimate Theory, the theory of everything if there will be one, will be ‘a finite set of marks on paper’ as Freeman Dyson put it.

I am not claiming that these marks occur on some of the three levels of language that are hidden according to the Rigveda. The composers of the Vedas had no idea about these matters but they were not held back by a behaviouristic or phenomenologic, ‘scientistic’ outlook and left ample space for a great variety of other languages to develop.

What can we learn from it? That our language, the characteristic of our species, is mysterious and has profound limitations of which we know little. Our understanding of the world and of ourselves necessarily suffers from these limitations. There is hope if we are willing to let languages expand.
