Vedic sciences and insights paved the way for the sciences of ritual and language. Both took account of the relevant facts and exhibited theoretical sophistication which included the uses of an artificial language. It is not easy to judge the merits of their insights. What we can say is that contemporary scientists working on language and the cognitive sciences have amassed vast amounts of information and reached deep insights of which their Vedic colleagues could have had no inkling. Did some of their insights go beyond present understandings? Can their ideas on *upāṃśu*, *aniruktagāna*, *tūṣṇīm*, breathing, mantras and the rest be understood and explained by other types of modern scientists—physiologists, neurologists and others as yet unborn?

The Vedic perspective on language took account of levels about which we seem to know little. Mantras, in particular, spanning the divide between ritual and language, have hardly been studied in a scientific spirit. Nothing is known about, say, mantras and aphasia. Our distant predecessors had a different perspective and were familiar with different facts about the human mind. Their knowledge may be as valuable as that of our successors in the future.

Due respect to the ancients should, of course, be based upon rational standards and stay away from politics. Governments have expressed opinions and made decisions they are not competent to make. In India, they have declared that ‘whatever is very ancient in India, that precisely is most modern for the world.’ In the USA, they have claimed that ‘intelligent design’ is another form of science. Such declarations show that these dignitaries are not familiar with the sciences and insights their institutions are supposed to embody. It demonstrates that *elementary* education, in important parts of even the ‘developed’ world, has sunk to dangerously low levels. If that continues, it will not affect the past but the future of sciences and insights, and, therefore, the future of the species, the environment and life on earth.
