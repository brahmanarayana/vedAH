### The Meaninglessness of Mantras

Mantras are not mysterious statements with deep meanings. They have no meaning because they are not statements and they are not statements because they are not language. Language is a human faculty which is concerned with *meaning* in its primary sense. In natural language, the domain of meaning is part of an intricate system. We shall take a closer look at this system in the next section, but it may be illustrated first by three expressions of language, each belonging to a different category:

1. *banana* which is a word, a noun in fact, that has a meaning to which I shall refer as ‘banana’.
2. *eating bananas* which is a phrase also has a meaning.
3. *Hiroshi likes bananas* which is a sentence also has a meaning.

What is systematic about these expressions is that indefinitely many, but not *any* other expressions may be substituted for any of their constituent words which would again lead to a similar category, that is a word, phrase or sentence:

In \(1\), any other word of the dictionary may be substituted for *banana* and the result will still be a word, by definition.

In \(2\), any noun that refers to an edible thing may be substituted for *banana*, but not *rivers* or *hesitations*; and similarly, a large number of verbal phrases may be substituted for *eating*, e.g., *liking, anticipating, throwing* but not *formulating* or *proposing.*

In \(3\), *Hiroshi* may be replaced by almost any name or expressions such as *the national hero of Finland*. But if we replace it by *King Janaka* we must replace *likes* by *liked*. Otherwise, the same conditions as were applicable to *eating bananas* in \(2\) apply to *likes bananas*. Note that all true or false sentences must be meaningful, but a meaningful sentence such as \(3\) need not be true, e.g., *Adolf Hitler loved Jews.*

The meaning of ‘last Sunday’s sunset’ is unlike the meanings of examples \(1\) to \(3\). It is not shared by the members of a community who share a language. It is much more restricted. It may have a meaning for *me* but only when it refers to a particular Sunday that I experienced. Perhaps I share some of it with others who witnessed the same sunset. But it is not part of their language. If you look up the dictionary under ‘Sunday’ you will not find my meaning there.

The same holds for the expression: ‘meaning of a mantra’. A mantra may have power or may perform a particular function. It has to be pronounced on a particular occasion. It may consist of the words of a language—Vedic Sanskrit, for example—but the meaning of the mantra is not the meaning of those words and *none* of the systematization of the expressions \(1\) through \(3\) applies to mantras unless it is by chance. There are a few exceptions to this general statement, e.g., mantras that belong to a special class such as *agnaye ida*ṃ *na mama*, *prajāpataye ida*ṃ *na mama*—of Chapter 7—not to mention the simple reason that the meaning of all the words that make up the mantra, or that of the entire sentence, if it is a sentence, need not be known to the users of the mantra.

Some of what applies to mantras applies to ritual. We shall return to ritual in the next chapter, but it is obvious that it is even further removed from language than mantras are. Ritual is a physical activity of the body but not only of the mouth and ears. It may accompany mantras as well as language but it is different from both.

If it is true that mantras and ritual have no meaning in the only intelligible sense, and are not language, are they not powerful and important? They are indeed as powerful and important as many other entities, say elephants or mice. Outside mythology, no one would even think of trying to explain an elephant by language. Perhaps an elephant, or elephants, or something about them may be explained with the help of biology, the theory of biological evolution, genetics, DNA or something else. Explanations of mantras and ritual that start from language, are similarly barking up the wrong tree. We must begin to accept, or regain the feeling that some readers who picked up this book may have had at the outset, that there is something to discover because we do not yet understand. It has nothing to do with familiarity. I am familiar with cars but I do not know how they are put together and have only the vaguest of notions about their origins in the history of human technology. Familiarity breeds not only contempt but a vague reaction like: yes, it is a mantra. If we wish to understand properly we must start with a sense of puzzlement, a sense of mystery even. Such a person feels lost. The reader who understands mantras and ritual already must stop here and go to Part IV.

Those of us who are puzzled and mystified may be pleased that the same embarrassment existed in Vedic India. As we have seen from Kautsa’s thesis \(*Eight: Atharvaveda*\), the Vedic tradition began to be questioned by its own followers. Kautsa focused on one particular feature: if mantras are regarded as language, they are meaningless. Part of the reason, and only a small part, lies in a particular historical development. The early portions of the Rigveda were jealously guarded by families who spoke a language, accompanied their rites and invoked their divinities in a language that was not at first understood by others who heard it spoken or used. It did not prevent these others from regarding Vedic mantras as powerful. Some were familiar with Sāmavedic chants that were similarly meaningless.

It is useful to remember that the historical development I sketched contributed to the unintelligibility of mantras, but more important to understand is that this is only a small part of the reason. Meaninglessness belongs to the nature of mantras. It is a feature of mantras as such. Kautsa’s arguments showed this clearly and the core of the argument is that mantras are not language. They lack the systematic nature that was illustrated by examples \(1\) to \(3\) above, but we need to know more about the system itself. Kautsa did because he was a linguist and I assume that most of my readers are not. More is now known about language than Kautsa knew and there are stronger and more decisive reasons that support his thesis.



### Language, Syntax and Recursiveness

When I use the term ‘language’, what I have in mind is languages such as English or Sanskrit, modern or classical, world languages or tribal languages. Languages change and evolve over time. They are born and they die. They belong to or originate in a specific community though they may be adopted by others and become widespread. But language is a system in which everything hangs together, *où tout se tient* as de Saussure put it.

The scientific study of language or linguistics distinguishes three domains: Phonology, Syntax and Semantics. Phonology deals with the sounds of language. It is typically concerned with such differences as Śākalya studied when he made his distinction between Saṃhitā and Padapāṭha in Chapter 4. It is dependent on structures of the mouth and the inner and outer ear, which restrict the sounds of human language and distinguish it from the chirping of birds or the mowing of cows which are also systems of sound that are used for communication but are not language.

Syntax deals with the structure of sentences. It distinguishes statements from questions or commands, actives from passives, future and past tenses, singular and plural and many other modes and categories. It may or may not be restricted by word order.

Semantics deals with meaning, that is, the world to which language refers, which it denotes or connotes, addresses, hears, sees, smells, remembers, listens to, imagines or depicts. Language does this by means of words but not only words. Semantics is closely connected with syntax because we understand not only words but also sentences. Which is primary—word meaning or sentence meaning—is a favourite topic of discussion among Indian linguists and philosophers of language. Words are, obviously, more manageable than sentences. They constitute a finite set and can be listed in a dictionary or encyclopaedia, in alphabetical or another order. Sentences are infinite in number.

How can sentences be infinite in number and how can infinite numbers of things be learned or interiorated? First, we have to know what infinity means. It means indefinitely large. An example is the set of integers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,…. It is infinitely large not because we arrive, at a certain moment, at an integer written with a special symbol that stands for ‘infinite’. It means: whenever ‘1’, belongs to it, the next number ‘2’ also belongs to it; and if ‘2’ belongs to it, ‘3’ does too. The set of integers is infinite because for each of its members, the next member is also a member and there is no end to that …. As it happens, ‘2’ is the same as ‘1 \+ 1,’ ‘3’ is the same as ‘2 \+ 1’, etc. We are able to express it neatly with the help of a little algebra: the set of integers has infinitely many members, because for any number *n*, it also has the next number: *n* \+ 1. That process can be repeated as often as we like and the number of natural numbers is therefore indefinitely large. There is no upper limit.

Returning to language we have seen that the number of words is finite but the number of sentences is infinitely large. This is due to a property of syntax called *recursiveness*. It means that also in language a structure may be repeated indefinitely often without there being an upper limit. An example from English is ‘*He said A*’, where ‘*A*’ is a sentence. That structure is repeated in *He said that he said A*; and once more in *He said that he said that he said A.* And so on. The reader may object that such sentences do not actually occur in English. It is true, but some English sentences cannot be analysed without presupposing that such structures underlie them, e.g., *Betty told me that Kumar, when asked about his opinion, immediately said that he had said A already.* When such sentences get longer they become increasingly unintelligible, but their underlying recursive structure remains the same. In other cases, the intelligibility or unintelligibility continues unabated, as in teacher’s lineages \(*guruparamparā*\) such as: ‘Pautimāṣya from Gaupavana, Gaupavana from Kauśika, Kauśika from Kauṇḍinya, Kauṇḍinya from Śaṇḍilya, Śaṇḍilya from Kauśika and Gautama, Gautama from Āgniveśya’ etc. in the Bṛhad-Āraṇyaka Upaniṣad.

Do we actually find very long sentences in natural languages? I am not a writer so I cannot construct a good example but the reader who is familiar with any of the following may look at Sanskrit compounds, a page of the Kādambarī, Navya-Nyāya, Proust or Thomas Mann. Take the longest compound or sentence you can find. Assume that the longest sentence you can find occurs in Proust. Call it P. I can *always* construct a longer one. Here it is: ‘Proust wrote *P*.’ This can be repeated ad libitum, and there is no upper bound.

How can things that are infinite in number be learned? By learning general principles that generate infinity. Recursiveness is one of these. It may be represented by an inverted tree. I shall start with a finite example, a simple syntactic structure that occurs in natural languages, perhaps in all languages \(an empirical matter\): the distinction between subject and predicate. It is *not* recursive.

Take the example: ‘Yājñavalkya taught Maitreyī’ or ‘Y taught M’. In English syntax, ‘Y’ is the subject and ‘taught M’ is the predicate. The predicate, therefore, consists of two parts: a verb and an object. Not all sentences in all languages have that simple structure. But a surprisingly large number can be reduced to such structures, using an astonishing proliferation of rules. So let us put those rules aside and concentrate on the basic structure of the sentence which is a *hierarchical* structure because it consists of two levels: subject and predicate, and, within predicate, verb and object:

![image](images/000044.png)

Linguists have proceeded to unearth much more abstract structures; but for our purposes it is enough, and we are going to generalize in other directions. The above structure shows a relation between some syntactic categories, which can also be expressed by simply stating: a sentence *consists* of a subject and a predicate; and: a predicate *consists* of a verb and an object. It does not necessarily have anything to do with word order, though the order of the figure is that of the example ‘Y taught M’. What the linguist does, he *generates* the sentence. It may be done by adding substitution rules that refer to a dictionary together with a list of names and that may be expressed by dots, as follows:

![image](images/000005.png)

This picture shows that a sentence, the *linear* structure *Yājñavalkya taught Maitrey*ī, has an underlying two-dimensional *non-linear* structure \(perhaps other systems use more dimensions, but I don’t know them\). That non-linear structure, or some structures like it, have been referred to as deep structure. It has a mysterious ring about it, but teaches us that the analysis of sentences shows that there are underlying, invisible structures that have to be postulated in order to explain the sentences that are produced and that we can hear.

How do we know that the above structure is the correct one? By analysing thousands of sentences. It makes no sense, for example, to analyse as follows:

![image](images/000013.png)

One reason is that there are many sentences in which the predicate consists only of a verb which is intransitive, e.g., *Yājñavalkya sits*. They share many properties with the sentences which have transitive verbs and objects leading to the postulation of a separate category called ‘Predicate’.

Systems like these were introduced by Noam Chomsky half a century ago. They attracted large numbers of researchers, but became increasingly complex. In 1995, Chomsky replaced them by a simpler but much more abstract system called *The Minimalist Program*. Since then, developments in linguistics have become even more explosive.

Our problems are different. We are interested in infinite recursive structures. Take the sentence: ‘He said *A*”.’ I shall not analyse it into Subject \(‘He’\) and Predicate \(‘said A’\) but cut it up differently, illustrating thereby what we call *quoting*. Quoting is recursive, we can continue to do it: ‘He said, “He said *A*”.’ I can go on but let me introduce a little variation: ‘A retorted, according to B, that C had said *X*.’ It is still abstract and stilted, so ‘We might think of the Professor who claimed that Proust had written *Vanity Fair*’. That is better although Proust himself is miles ahead: ‘And so I could not help reciting to myself, when I saw them, not indeed the lines of Racine that had come into my head at the Princesses de Guermantes’s while M. de Vaugoubert stood watching young embassy secretaries greet M. de Charlus, but other lines of Racine …’ and on it goes without losing the attention of the attentive reader or syntactician.

Let me be a little more systematic and distinguish *right-recursive* and *left-recursive*. An English example of the first is: ‘Remarkable is the rapidity of the motion of the wing of the hummingbird.’ The noun phrase to which something is added is always on the right:
>
> the rapidity of the hummingbird,

> the rapidity of the wing of the hummingbird,

> the rapidity of the motion of the wing of the

> hummingbird, etc.\(?\)

We are lucky in that English possesses a similar structure which goes the other way and is therefore called *left-recursive* because the noun phrase is always on the left:
>
> the hummingbird’s rapidity

> the hummingbird’s wing’s rapidity

> the hummingbird’s wing’s motion’s rapidity, etc. \(?\)

Psychologists are interested in these recursions. I have taken the last six phrases from an article by George Miller on psycholinguistics that is almost half a century old. It illustrates the distinction Chomsky introduced between *competence* and *performance*. The rules of grammar depict a speaker’s competence. The six phrases are examples of performance. But I have put a \(?\) at the end of some of them. How far can the reader go? Asking Harvard undergraduates, Miller arrived at the conclusion that the third and sixth illustrate their limit.

The reader will now have an inkling of what mantras and Vedic rites can be like. Our next question is different: how can these different structures be learnt?

Through the interplay of empirical information and innate knowledge. Learning a language takes place for a only a small part by explicit instruction of a mother, father or teacher. It is mainly picked up by babies, from a very early age, by being immersed in a language community in which people, including playmates, visitors, salesmen, brothers, sisters, fathers, mothers, teachers or anyone or anything within hearing of the child, including the TV, uses the language. This picking up of language occurs within a few years and is similar to the way scientists learn about the world. They construe a succession of theories, each the result of earlier theories and new data. Children are quick to change their theories when they make a wrong generalization, for example, in English: from *trees*, *dogs* and *books* to \**mans* and \**womans* \(the asterisk denotes ungrammaticality\) until they notice or are told that they should say *men* and *women*.

Many ‘deep structures’ are innate. The deeper they are, the more abstract they look to us. What is not innate is the association of fragments of speech with events, occurrences or objects in the outside world. Those are picked up by the child by not only listening but by seeing and using other mental capacities such as association, generalization, combinations of various kinds and, of course, memory.

Mantras are similar in some respects. They incorporate recursive structures. They may be long and there are many of them. In Tantrism it is said that seventy million of them exist in superior worlds. But mantras are not learnt in the way language is picked up as we shall see at the end of this chapter.



### Steps Beyond Kautsa

Kautsa gave four reasons for the meaninglessness of mantras. \(1\) The sound of mantras may not be changed unlike in language where sounds may change provided meaning remains the same. \(2\) The order of elements in mantras may not be changed, unlike in Sanskrit where word order is to a large extent free. \(3\) If mantras were meaningful, it would have to be conceded that they are often contradictory or inconsistent with each other. That is not uncommon in language, where it is common for speakers to say different things, but it becomes an embarrassment when dealing with canon formation, i.e. the establishment of a source of authority. \(4\) There is a tradition to transmit the sounds of mantras but not their meanings, unlike the connection between sounds and meanings in language that is sometimes taught but generally picked up by children. It is the last reason with which I have been chiefly concerned in the previous section and to which we shall return most often.

Before we do so we must note that there are other reasons which Kautsa might have mentioned. A reason \(5\) to which we have referred already in Chapter 8 is that mantras are repeated incessantly. It may be expressed by a simple recursive rule of the type we have studied in the previous section. In English, we may say: *Please, please, please pass me the salt* if we have already asked before and are repeating our request. It sounds a little odd, and if we were to repeat *please* four times it would definitely be looked upon as eccentric. Mantras, on the other hand, are happily repeated. It holds not only for mantras like OM, which are repeated many times and during long periods without intermission, but for mantras couched in language such as the Gāyatrī mantra which an ‘orthodox’ brahman repeats every day. *Orthodox* \(‘of right opinion’\) is not the appropriate term here because such repetitions involve ritual where *orthoprax* \(‘of right action’\) is the correct appellation as we shall continue to observe.

If Kautsa’s perspective had not been confined to Vedic India and he had been able to look beyond its borders and to the future, he would have come up with at least two other reasons in support of his thesis: mantras remain invariant in history \(6\) and in geography \(7\). They are different from language in these respects. Languages change over time and change across language boundaries where they are translated. Mantras do not. Though often kept secret and guarded jealously, some Vedic mantras were inherited by Buddhists and Tantrics. Often referred to as *dhāra*ṇī, they travelled from India to South-east Asia, crossed the Himalayas from Kashmir into Central Asia, China, Korea, Japan and Tibet, and finally reached the Euro-Americas. The emperor of China accepted them in exchange for tea, silk, porcelain and lacquers and in California they fetched high prices. During these travels, the mantras did not change. That mantras are untranslatable, like proper names, was recognized by Chinese pilgrims such as Hiuan-tsang \(Xuanzang\) who were translators themselves.

When a mantra is introduced into a new linguistic environment, its forms may be affected to some extent. Though OM remains the same in Tibet or Japan, SVĀHĀ is adapted to the phonetic structure of Japanese where it became SOWAKA. Within India itself, mantras couched in Vedic such as the Gāyatrī were preserved without change, but the language of the reciters changed from Vedic to other Indic languages. Maintaining the original forms of a ritual language is advocated in a similar spirit with respect to Latin in the Catholic Mass and Arabic in the Qur’ān. Reasons\(6\) and \(7\) illustrate again that what counts for mantras is not *meaning*, let alone social contexts, but *form*. Emphasis on form is a basic feature of ancient Indian civilization and accounts for much of its emphasis on explicit statements, its scientific creativity and many of its other strengths.



### Pragmatics, Speech Acts and Bird Song

If mantras are not language, for the analysis of which specialized disciplines such as linguistics, philology or literary criticism have been developed, where do we find more adequate concepts and categories to study them successfully? Can we learn something from logic or philosophy?

A popular approach to the study of mantras has been *pragmatics*. I am not referring to the pragmatism of William James, John Dewey or other philosophers, but to a discipline that is closely related to logic and that deals with so-called indexicals. Bertrand Russell called them ‘egocentric particulars’. These expressions of language do not refer to the outside world but to the speaker in his or her immediate context or situation. Examples are: ‘I’, ‘you’, ‘here’, ‘now’ or ‘to-morrow’. What is the difference between these and other expressions of language? If the reader and I say ‘tree’, both of us refer to the same thing. If we both say ‘I’, the reader refers to the reader and I refer to myself. If we say ‘you’, the reader refers to me and I refer to the reader. In both cases, we use the same words but do not refer to the same things.

Within the domain of pragmatics, a productive subcategory of indexicals or egocentric particulars is that of ‘speech acts’. These were introduced by J.L. Austin, the Oxford ‘ordinary language’ philosopher, refined by his former assistant Paul Grice and by John Searle, both at Berkeley, along with others. Many students of mantras have argued that mantras are speech acts. What are speech acts?

Speech acts are language utterances by which an act is performed. They depend on context and on the speaker, and are therefore indexicals. The only language from which empirical evidence for the existence of such a separate category has been studied on a large scale is modern English. Speech acts have uncommon properties. They depend on the qualification of the agent who utters them. If a priest or minister addresses two people with the words: ‘I unite you in marriage,’ he has not merely said something. He has performed an act by which the two are now married to each other. If a non-qualified person such as myself addresses two people with the same words, it has no effect. It is an utterance of speech, but not a speech act. The people addressed may also have to meet special requirements. They may be required to be two in number and, in many places, of different sex or gender.

Most of the utterances of language are not speech acts. If I say ‘it is raining’, it may be true or untrue depending on time and place, but its meaning is the same and I have not performed an act. If I say ‘I promise to see you tomorrow’, the meaning varies with the referents of the indexicals \(‘I’ and ‘tomorrow’\) and it may or may not be an act, depending on my character. If I am a reliable person who keeps his promises, I have bound myself to someone else and staked my reputation. In that case, it is an act and, therefore, a speech act.

Some scholars have widened the domain of speech acts beyond Austin so as to encompass *all* utterances of language. It illustrates one of the great strategies of empty scholarship. If *all* objects of an inquiry are labelled with a new name, nothing has changed and no new insight has been obtained. A new name may carry a whiff of suggestion; but if the name already denotes members of a particular class, the suggestion is confusing. Calling an utterance an act is such a misleading suggestion. For we would still have to distinguish between acts that merely speak and acts that ‘really’ act. If I kill a person with an axe it is an act and not an utterance.

I conclude that mantras are neither language nor speech acts. Their powers are different and distant from the concepts and categories that are used in logic, philosophy and the human sciences. That is in accordance with a simple fact that we have not so far taken into account: mantras are not confined to humans. That has never raised an eyebrow in Indic civilization, and other civilizations like it, which do not regard humans as basically different from other animals. The Upaniṣads accept it as a matter of course that needs no further discussion. The Chāndogya tells us about dogs that are gathered around a white dog and said to him: ‘Please, Sir, find us some food by singing\!’ They sat down together and made the sound *hu*ṃ. Then they sang: ‘OM\! Let us eat\! OM\! Let us drink\!’

If the human sciences cannot make sense of mantras—just as they throw no light on elephants or mice—it stands to reason that we should widen our net and study them in the context of the animal kingdom. It is a productive approach with plenty of empirical support. Animals chirp, grunt, bark, moo, bellow, roar, mew, cry, twitter and twit. Many of these sounds belong to structured systems and some of them have been studied in detail and depth. I shall confine myself in our context to one of the richest, most varied and impressive animal sound systems: bird song. It has not been studied by humans as long and deeply as human language, but there exists an extensive literature about it. The study of bird song has not led to unanimous conclusions with regard to its meaning or semantics, but its *syntactic* study, though in its infancy, has been fruitful and the results are uncontroversial.

The syntactic study of bird song was initiated by a composer and musicologist, François Bernard Mâche, who discarded the traditional use by ornithologists of spectrograms. Spectrograms show continuity. Mâche used musical and other symbolic notations that show that bird song consists of discrete, digital units. The units of bird song may be referred to by notes, letters or approximated by transcriptions into the English alphabet such as *chyup, chup-chup-zee*, or *churrr*. As we have seen in Chapter 6, musical notations are helpful in the study of the Sāmaveda, where no one would even think of using spectrograms. Their use has been common since the Renaissance when the Jesuit polymath Athanasius Kircher studied a bit of Sāmaveda.

The Sāmaveda illustrates clearly that not only language but also stobhas, a type of mantras, possess a syntax that consists of discrete units that are combined with each other and may be converted into other structures by syntactic rules. Such rules transform one sequence—*agna āyahi vītaye*—into another: *o gnā i / ā yā hi vā i / tā yā i tā yā i /*. Some were formulated in the *Pu*ṣ*pasūtra*, a late work that belongs to the Kauthuma school of the Sāmaveda. The syntax of stobhas is extremely complex as I have illustrated elsewhere \(Staal 1989, 1993, Chapter 19\).

The syntactic structures of language, mantras and bird songs are generally different but sometimes overlap. Mantras are in some respects closer to bird song than to language. It is difficult to evaluate the significance of such a fact because the comparative study of these three distinct domains has remained virtually unexplored and would need to be embarked upon before we know where mantras belong, if anywhere. In the present section, I shall briefly discuss two examples from the domain of mantras, leaving a third for the following section which deals with ritual. Example 1 illustrates a feature that is shared by mantras and bird song but is absent from language. Example 2 illustrates a feature that is found in all three domains. Example 3 illustrates again a feature that ritual possesses and mantras in its wake, but that is absent from language.

Example 1 is the simplest and we have met with it already: mantras and bird songs both repeat the same sounds indefinitely: A A A A …. The recursive rule is: **A > AA**. Language does not have such a rule because utterances like *please, please, please* soon have to stop as we have seen.

Example 2 exhibits a more basic structure of which the repetitions of Example 1 may be regarded as the simplest and least interesting case. I am referring to the *recursiveness* that is a property of the syntax of human language and that we have already met in the section on language \(*Eleven: Mantras*\).

Linguists have claimed that recursiveness is a basic characteristic of human language and is not found anywhere else. Mantras and bird song provide two counter-examples to this claim. Let us begin with mantras with which we are already familiar. The clearest examples come again from the Sāmaveda. Sequences such as *bhu bhā bhi bha bhe bha bha bh*ī *bhā bha bha bhi bha bha bhā bha* \(above *Six: Sāmaveda*\) are created by replacing the syllables of the underlying song by syllables that retain their vowel but substitute for their initial consonant or consonants *bh-*. It is a process that can be continued indefinitely with respect to the number of syllables or sentences, as in: *it is a bhobhess bhat bhan bhe bhonbhibued inbhebhibhibhebhy*, etc., but this is not a procedure we find in a natural language.

We need to spend a little more time on the case of bird song which may be unfamiliar to some readers. A well-studied case is that of the Black-capped Chick-a-dee tit. Its songs consist of discrete or digital units which I shall represent by capital letters. Four units, *A*, *B*, *C, D*, are repeated indefinitely but with certain constraints: *A* may be followed by *D*, and in that sequence, *AD*, both elements may be repeated indefinitely. The same holds for *BCD*, where *C* may be repeated indefinitely. We may find, for example, *AAAADDD* or *BCCCD*. But we never find *DCA.* There are several underlying rules which we can state more precisely when we take more details into account.

The same holds for language and mantras. In language, a *different* beginning may be followed by an *identical* end. For example, *Maya was eager to go to the concert* and *all her disciples were eager to go to the concert*. Conversely, the beginnings may be the same and the ends different: *Maya was eager to go to the dinner* and *Maya was eager to go to the concert*. What we do not find is the opposite one, i.e. *\*dinner Maya was eager to go to the*. A borderline case may depend on emphasis in context: *She detested cocktails but to the dinner Maya was eager to go.*

The same holds for mantras but in a different manner. It may lead to confusions or mistakes as T.P. Mahadevan and I encountered during the Morning Litany of a Soma ritual performed in 2003. The difficulty is due to the fact that 356 mantras from all over the Rigveda are recited but in a different order from the one in which they had been studied first and continue to be recited on other occasions.

What happened is that RV 5.79.1, the 218th mantra in the sequence, begins with *mahe no adya bodhaya*. Another mantra in the Rigveda, 7.75.2, begins with *mahe no adya* but then continues: *suvitāya bodhi*. It is very confusing not only because *bodh*-occurs in both mantras, but also because RV 7.75.2 does not occur in the Morning Litany at all though each of the poems 7.73, 7.74, 7.77, 7.78,7.79, 7.80 and 7.81 are recited there, almost as if a trap was planned. The reciter of the Litany fell into it but not the young assistant, sitting at his side.

The lapse implies that ‘mindless’ recitations of colossal amounts of mantras are not a mindless matter. It contributes, moreover, to the ‘picking up’ of mantras by youngsters during performances of Vedic rituals, which though similar to the picking up of language, occurs much more rarely.

But that is not the end of the story for the error that was made is different in structure from replacing *Maya was eager to go to the dinner* by *Maya was eager to go to the concert*. In order to explain this we have to look deeper which we shall do at the end of the next section on the Gāyatrī mantra. We should keep in mind that, whatever the similarities between mantras and bird song, we do not descend from birds. What does that imply? That the causes for the similarities in structure lie deeper. About mantras we still know little. As for recursiveness, there are different kinds and natural language, birds, mantras and ritual reveal instructive similarities and differences.

We can say one thing about the power of mantras. It pertains to those who possess them. Mantras strengthen memory and breath. The remaining questions about mantras are about the activity they accompany: do they strengthen it in some sense or other? Can they replace it as the mental or *mānasa* cup replaces a cup made of clay? We raised such questions in Chapter 8 in connection with the Atharvavedic mantras that accompany surgery. I have *ad hoc* ramblings but no general answer. But that is not very different from the results the study of bird song had reached about a decade ago when Catchpole and Slater \(1995\) described the state of the art: the diversity is so great, that it ‘defies explanation’ and we are left ‘to puzzle over the resulting richness and variety that evolution has created’.



### The Gāyatrī Mantra

The Gāyatrī mantra is called after its metre \(*Five: Rigveda*\): it consists of three verses of eight syllables which are long ‘—’ or short ‘^’ as in the following scheme:

How close mantras are to ritual is shown by the teaching of the Gāyatrī mantra which takes place during the initiation ritual of *upanayana*. Similar in formation to *upani*ṣ*ad* \(‘sitting near’\), *upanayana* means ‘taking near’. ‘Near’ may again be to the teacher, here called *ācārya*, or to the stage of studenthood after which the student is called a *brahmacārin*. There are many ceremonies after which the teacher takes the boy’s hand and makes him look at the sun. After numerous other exchanges, variously described in various manuals, student and teacher sit north of a fire, the student facing east, that is, looking at the teacher, and the teacher facing west. The teacher then makes him repeat the first verse:
>
> *tat savitur vareṇyaṃ*.

He then makes him similarly repeat the second:
>
> *bhargo devasya dhīmahi*

and the third:
>
> *dhiyo yo na* *pracodayāt.*

Finally he makes him repeat all three:
>
> *tat savitur vareṇyaṃ*

> *bhargo devasya dhīmahi dhiyo yo naḥ pracodayāt.*

The boy is then given a staff, a grass girdle and several instructions, e.g., he should remain standing during the rest of the day. During the years of study that follow, he will be taught to learn by heart the Vedic school to which he belongs. He should not sleep by day and put a fire-stick on the fire in the morning and the evening. He should continue to recite the mantra every day at sunrise and sunset, at least ten and not more than a thousand times, depending again on his Vedic school.

Though the mantra has come to stand for the essence of the Veda, its recital at sunrise and sunset connects it with the sun. Savitā is the sun or rather, to distinguish him from Sūrya, the driving force behind the sun. The *brahmacārin* may sense that much though there is no rule that he should be told. The teacher may happen to be a scholar, traditional or modern, by inclination, but it is not part of his ritual task. He does not interpret or explain. The teaching is *orthoprax*, not *orthodox*. Kautsa had already drawn attention to the fact that there is a tradition for mantras to be learnt by heart, but no corresponding tradition to teach and thereby preserve their meaning.

It is difficult to say why the Gāyatrī mantra became so famous. It comes from an early poem of the Rigveda that invokes various deities. P.V. Kane refers to its ‘grand simplicity’ but that might be apparent to a learned scholar only. To a modern reader, the entire effort may make little sense apart from being a training of memory and an exercise in discipline. A modern or postmodern scholar may add that a sense of ‘identity’ is installed here. Yes, the *brahmacārin* is initiated into his Vedic school. It is his ‘second birth’ after he was born already in the general and non-Vedic sense, becoming a human and not a fish. I wonder whether humans in traditional societies think about ‘identity’. A modern and trendy concept. The Gāyatrī mantra as I have described is conveyed to a student at the time of his *upanayana* or initiation into the Brahman community. With the hardening of the caste system in post-Vedic times, ritual discussions proliferated about the question whether the three classes of ‘twice-born’ castes, *brāhma*ṇ*as, k*ṣ*atriyas* and *vaiśyas* should all be initiated with the same mantra or with different mantras. If the latter, mantras are differentiated from each other by their metres: *tri*ṣṭ*ubh* \(four verses of eleven syllables\) and *jagat*ī \(four verses of twelve syllables\). The system remained the same and preserved the same formal character.

Kautsa’s observation that there is a tradition for mantras to be learnt by heart, but no corresponding tradition to teach and thereby preserve their meaning, is full of significance and deep implications. To understand it better we must take a closer look at that tradition.

Transmitting the Gāyatrī mantra requires an elaborate ritual setting. For the student, it is an act of intense concentration, whether or not he is puzzled by its significance. It is very different from picking up a language, almost unconsciously, by hearing what other people, including fathers, mothers, other family members, teachers, playmates, visitors, salesmen or anyone within hearing of the student say and do when they use their language. This picking up of language occurs within a few years and is based upon knowledge and capacities drawn from an innate component or components of the mind.

Some of these features apply, or apply in a more or less similar fashion, to mantras. Youngsters who sit around when teachers are reciting or priests perform rituals pick up something. But they have to be explicitly taught a great deal more, unlike the babies or small children who acquire mastery over the partly innate faculty of language that humans possess. Unless it is a particular song—like a password—a youngster is never taught a sequence of words like the *brahmacārin* who learns to recite: *tat savitur vare*ṇ*ya*ṃ *bhargo devasya dhīmahi dhiyo yo na*ḥ *pracodayāt*. He has to repeat that sequence at sunrise and sunset, and on other specified occasions, throughout most of his life. No sentence of a maternal language needs to be repeated like that.

Picking up language includes another feature that is different from recitation: infinitely many other forms are picked up as well. After picking up: ‘Give me a piece of bread,’ the child may substitute another word in order to obtain another effect: ‘Give me a cookie.’ Note that the child may never have heard that same sentence before. I am not a child psychologist, so must confine myself to simplistic constructions, but there are others known from history which are not simple and make the same point. The British historian T.B. Macaulay was regarded as a retarded child until he opened his mouth for the first time when he was almost ten years old. During a party, a lady slipped and poured a pot of tea over the poor dumb child who then opened his mouth and said: ‘Don’t worry Madam, the pain has much abated.’ Can we do anything like that with the Gāyatrī mantra? Can we substitute a single word, keeping the same structure, for example, and produce another mantra:
>
> \* *tat śivasya vare*ṇ*ya*ṃ *bhargo devasya dhīmahi dhiyo yo na*ḥ * pracodayāt*

or more daringly:
>
> *\* tat savitur vare*ṇ*ya*ṃ *bhargo śivasya dhīmahi dhiyo yo na*ḥ *pracodayāt*

or worst of all but still keeping the structure:
>
> *\* tat savitur vare*ṇ*ya*ṃ *bhargo devasya śivasya dhiyo yo na*ḥ *pracodayāt*?

> \(asterisks indicate here that the following expression is not a mantra\).

Why did I say, in the last case, ‘worst of all’? Because I know the language and therefore the syntax which the reciter or the reader need not. Even so, the reader will have noticed that I substituted the name of a god \(Śiva\) with an ending \(*śivasya*\) in the first two cases for forms of the names of another god \(*savitur*\) or for the word god itself \(*devasya*\). In the third case, I replaced a different kind of word, in fact, a verbal form \(*dhīmahi*\) by *śivasya*. None of these things can be done with mantras though they all illustrate what a child learns when it learns a language; but the last case illustrates a thing children who learn a language never do. They may say *mans* when they should say *men*, but they would not continue to say *cookie* when they mean *go out*.

We cannot take a mantra and add it recursively to another, or another to it, or something else similar to the manner in which it is done in learning a natural language. There is only one recursive rule that can be used in the realm of mantras and that of *stobhas* in the Sāmaveda: repetition. But did we not see, in the Morning Litany, that mantras were recited in the same manner in which *Maya was eager to go to the dinner* was replaced by *Maya was eager to go to the concert* \(earlier in this chapter\)?

We did, but if we look more closely the two situations are totally different. The two sentences about Maya differ *syntactically* as well as semantically: the objects of Maya’s eagerness are syntactic objects, *dinner* and *concert*, and they occur in a specific place in the structure of the sentence. The common part of the two mantras, *mahe no adya*, has no syntactic status at all. They are merely the first three words of a series of words. They have no internal structure and can only be depicted by an expression of the unstructured form:

Mantras are memorized from left to right and if two mantras happen to begin with the same two sequences, like **A1 A2 A3**, mistakes like the ones that were made during the 2003 Soma ritual are likely to occur. It does not imply that mantras do not have a structure—we have seen that they do—but it is totally different from the syntactic stucture of a natural language and learning that structure is a totally different process also.

Not only their structure, also their function is entirely different. And last but not least, apparent words or what look like words in mantras cannot be replaced by others, one of the most striking characteristics of natural language which accounts for its extraordinary creativity and is largely responsible for distinguishing the human animal from other animal species.

It is a good thing that there is a tradition for mantras to be learnt by heart for otherwise there would be no Vedas. My conclusion, that the system of mantras is unlike the system of language, does not affect and has nothing to do with their value. But we should know what they are and what they are not, and what we have learnt in this chapter is that Vedic mantras, whether we are referring to obviously meaningless syllables such as the stobhas, or to mantras that consist of words, are learnt in a manner that is differerent from the manner in which a natural language is learnt.

All of this has nothing to do with the undoubted fact, that almost all mantras that consist of words were originally used in sentences and in a meaningful fashion in the Vedic contexts from where they were taken. They may be bits and pieces of these original sentences, or entire sentences like the Gāyatrī mantra. As we are coming to the end of the present chapter, the reader may be curious to know *what* the meaning of that mantra is, even if it is only distantly related to our topic. By ‘meaning’ I mean: the meaning of the language of the verse of the Rigveda from where it is taken which is RV 3.62.10. Its meaning is: ‘May we receive this excellent splendour of the god Savitā, which should inspire our thoughts\!’ It may be understood by the reciter, all or in part, depending on his knowledge of the language; perhaps he is a student of Sanskrit or on his way to becoming one. But understanding its language is nowhere required and has nothing to do with the ritual functions of that mantra. That is the full significance of Kautsa’s fifth thesis: ‘There is a tradition for mantras to be learnt by heart, but no corresponding tradition to teach and thereby preserve their meaning.’
