### Mantra and Kalpa

Much of what we found in the preceding chapter is formulated briefly, but clearly, in a post-Vedic work of uncertain date, the Ṛ*gvidhāna*: ‘The mantras attain the \(desired\) result by the correct method \(*vidhi*\) in the *brāhma*ṇ*a*; they give success, when they are employed in the right ritual manner \(*vidhivat*\)’ \(translated by J. Gonda\).

At the end of the previous chapter we have studied the upanayana initiation during which the Gāyatrī mantra is taught to a young student. I have argued that the way it is learned is totally different from the manner in which children learn or rather pick up their native natural language. But just as mantras derive their effectiveness from ritual, and not from language, no Vedic rite should be performed without mantras. In ritual, mantras are also treated differently from the sentences of a language. In the utterance of the latter, shouting, whispering or silence are options that individuals may use on whatever occasions they wish. If I cannot be heard, I may decide to raise my voice. If I wish to inspire confidentiality, I may whisper. But in ritual contexts, the occasions are fixed. When offerings are made, the accompanying mantra ends with *vau*ṣ*a*ṭ\! ‘May \(Agni\) lead the offerings to the gods\!’ The priest should shout the second syllable ṢAṬ\! at the top of his voice. In a larger number of contexts, mantras are recited mentally \(*manasā*\), more specifically *upā*ṃ*śu*, ‘articulated but inaudible’ \(*Seven: Yajurveda*\), which is distinguished from the ritual being performed *tūṣṇīm*, ‘in silence’.

Unlike mantras, ritual consists of acts. I can do no more than give a rough idea of a syntactic study of Vedic ritual. We cannot even envisage instituting a large-scale syntactic comparison between mantras, ritual, language, bird song, other animal sound systems and rituals not to mention music and dance. Such a research programme lies in the future. If it is ever done, the study of Vedic mantras and ritual will be an integral part of it.

A common Indic term for ritual is *karman,* derived from the root *k*ṛ*-* which means ‘to do’. I have used it before and shall use it again, but it means so many other things that it is best avoided. Its vagueness may be an asset when describing references in the Rigveda that are too fragmentary to help us reconstruct specific rituals. In the Yajurveda, where many rituals are known in precise detail from Sūtra texts and performances, I shall use the term *kalpa*, which means both ritual practice and the science of ritual as we have seen. It is derived from a root *kḷp-* which means ‘prepare’ or ‘arrange’. Its derivative *vikalpa* or ‘alternative’ denotes practices and rituals of other schools such as Baudhāyana or Āpastamba—not rival schools since they do not contradict but co-exist and are compatible with each other, as are the different lineages themselves.



### The Exclusion of Śrauta from Anthropology in English

We have mainly looked at Śrauta rituals \(*Seven: Yajurveda*\) which are described in the Śrauta Sūtras. The other important component of *kalpa* are the Gṛhya or ‘domestic’ rites which include birth, initiation, marriage, funeral ceremonies and other life-cycle ceremonies. They were not included in Table 1 \(*Four: The Four Vedas*\) but incorporate the *upanayana* ceremony of which we needed an approximate idea because it provided the ritual background and context for the Gāyatrī mantra. One reason for the exclusion of life-cycle ceremonies from the present account of Vedic ritual is that these types of ceremony occur worldwide. Though their forms vary greatly, their social functions and significance are well understood since Arnold van Gennep whose ideas were developed by a group of British, American, and other anthropologists that include Victor Turner, Mary Douglas, Clifford Geertz and others. Life-cycle ceremonies may be explained in terms of boundaries that are crossed. I shall confine myself to the Śrauta rituals not only because they are, in Vedic India, more basic, but also because they cannot be explained with the help of the conceptual machinery of these anthropologists. It is here that the theories of ritual of many scholars of religion and of social scientists, especially in the English-speaking world, break down. The other reasons for not including the domestic rituals here is that the only remarkable features they possess beyond ‘liminality’ are influenced by or modelled on Śrauta rites.

Claude Lévi-Strauss could have made a great contribution were it not for the fact that he, perhaps wisely, excluded Indic materials almost entirely from the data on which his work was based. There is one apparent exception: in the 1950s, Lévi-Strauss did fieldwork in East Pakistan, among Buddhists of the Chittagong area. Unlike Obeyesekhere, whose work exudes lifelong familiarity with Sri Lankan Buddhism, Lévi-Strauss gave the Burmese surface a good scratch: he interpreted their ‘Buddhism’ as if it were a kind of Protestantism, neglecting the Mahāyāna which is or was part of Buddhism both in Sri Lanka and Myanmar. We shall return to these distinctions in Part V.

Lévi-Strauss could have made a contribution to the understanding of Śrauta rites because he had the basic background. He knew that appearance and reality are not the same thing. He attributed that insight, common to Plato and the Upaniṣads \(Chapter 10\), to his knowledge of geology and his familiarity with Marx. But he was also inspired by the distinctive features that the linguist Roman Jakobson had introduced in phonology. It might have opened new vistas and may still do so, if a modern student combines these insights with the study of Śrauta ritual.

One reason for the failure of modern anthropologists and other social scientists in the English-speaking world to come to terms with Śrauta rites is that they failed to see that the authors of the ritual Sūtras also had theories as they did themselves. That failure is surprising since the road was paved in 1899 by two French scientists: Henry Hubert and Marcel Mauss.

According to Mauss, Hubert did most of the work. It is unlikely because the cooperation between these two in a number of publications was remarkably close. Marcel Mauss was the greater scientist. He was the son-in-law of Emile Durkheim, the leader of French sociology until his death in 1917 when Mauss took over. In France, sociology is a serious and important subject which includes the study of civilization, the history of religions and much else. Sociological journals such as *L’Année Sociologique* are read not only by university professors but discussed by intellectuals. One of Mauss’s most famous books that he published under his own name was ‘An Essay on the Gift’. What enhances his importance to Vedic studies is that he had studied with the brilliant Sanskritist Sylvain Lévi who taught him a course on Vedic ritual in which he was the only student. The work that was published by Hubert and Mauss in 1899 incorporates these studies. Its first part, an ‘Essay on the Nature and Function of Ritual,’ is chiefly based upon Vedic and Jewish rites but provides what is perhaps the most serious sociological and anthropological study of ritual. Does it provide us with meanings?

It does not but the reader may wonder whether contemporary performances, more within the purview of anthropologists, may not provide those very meanings that have eluded us so far. T.P. Mahadevan and I have studied such performances and, not surprisingly, found that meanings are assigned to these performances and some of their elements or features. However, they reflect belief systems with which the rituals have nothing to do. That does not only apply to anachronistic interpretations of Vedic ritual in terms of ‘Hinduism’, but also to Vedic myths such as we have touched upon in Part II. In other words, rituals are like mantras: they tend to remain the same but interpretations change. That includes Vedic myths that are not invoked by the Śrauta Sūtras, but by Brāhmaṇas and modern scholars. Even in Vedic times, experts agree that Vedic ritual had little to do with Vedic mythology. According to Renou: ‘Vedic religion is first and foremost a liturgy, and only secondarily a mythological or speculative system; we must therefore investigate it as a liturgy.’ R.N. Dandekar wrote in a similar vein: ‘The Rigvedic mythology can be shown to have hardly any relation to the ‘solemn’ \(i.e. *śrauta*\) ritual.’

Sometimes interpretations change rituals. This seems to apply especially to more recent or contemporary performances. When it was no longer believed that the ritual patron and the sacrificial animals would attain heaven, and when not only the Jainas but society in general condemned the ritual killing, or any killing of animals, goats were replaced by substitutes in South Indian Vedic ritual as we described in AGNI, our account of the 1975 performance of an Agnicayana. Robert Sharf has studied a more radical development in the Japanese Shingon ritual, which is related to the Vedic \(ladles of the same shape are used, for example\) and where theologians have for many centuries discussed and added to traditional rituals. Semantic content clearly mattered. Do the Japanese like adding—Indic syllabaries to Kanji characters without choosing like the Koreans—to some extent? I like Sharf’s emphasis on powerful and mysterious forces. I doubt psychology or sociology, as I know them, will assist, but it is obvious that these discussions have not come to an end.



### Self-Embedding and Other Animals

One difficulty for ritual theory that Hubert and Mauss did not confront is that rituals form a hierarchy and rites at the top of it may last a thousand years or more. To state such a fact, we need recursiveness for statements cannot be infinitely long. Recursiveness is needed to explain language as we have seen. But recursiveness occurs in ritual also and there is a link between grammar and ritual theory. The grammarian Patañjali, author of the *Great Commentary* on Pāṇini’s grammar, was the first to arrive at that important insight. He wrote that neither rites, nor forms of language can be enumerated because no such enumeration would reach the end. Ritual and language can only be described and explained by treatises that provide *rules*. Such rules are called *sūtra* and that is what the Śrauta Sūtras and Pāṇini’s grammar are therefore called.

We have studied *left-recursive* and *right-recursive* rules. Ritual exhibits another feature of recursiveness that ritual possesses and mantras in its wake, but that is rare in language: *self-embedding*. Fortunately for us, it may be constructed by combining simple *left-* and *right-recursive* sentences from English \(the latter exhibits the same syntactic forms as we looked at before\). The following examples are increasingly stilted, but have been constructed in accordance with the rules of English grammar:

1. left-recursiveness:  
   *The roof of the building* which may be represented as BA;  
   *The chimney of the roof of the building* or CBA;  
   *The colour of the chimney of the roof of the building* or DCBA.
2. right-recursiveness:  
   *The building’s roof* or AB;  
   *The building’s roof’s chimney* or ABC;  
   *The building’s roof’s chimney’s colour* or ABCD.
3. *self-embedding*:  
   *The roof the building has* or BAB;  
   *The chimney the roof the building has has* or CBABC which is, in fact, C\(BAB\)C;  
   *The colour the chimney the roof the building has has has* or DCBABCD which is, in fact, D\(C\(BAB\)C\)D.

All three examples are artificial but \(1\) and \(2\) are possible and may become more natural if we introduce variations \(as in: *the colour of the chimney that sits on the roof of the building\).* All but the first of \(3\) are simply unintelligible. We can have billions of have-nots, but English cannot combine two *haves* together.

In Vedic ritual, \(3\) is very common. Here is a simplified example of D\(C\(BAB\)C\)D:
>
> D: constructing the enclosure

> C: entering the enclosure

> B: preparing the fire

> A: making an offering

> B: covering the fire

> C: leaving the enclosure

> D: destroying the enclosure.

Note that the last sequence corresponds to the first, the pre-final to the second, etc. It is a very common practice when performing an activity. We enter the room, open the cupboard, take out the cigar box, unlock and open it, take out the diamonds, close and lock the box again, close the cupboard and leave the room. We have, in this structure, taken one step more: EDCBABCDE or E\(D\(C\(BAB\)C\)D\)E. It does not occur in language unless it depicts an ongoing activity and someone expresses it with the help of concatenation as I just did. Self-embedding exists in mantras because Vedic rites are performed with mantras which mirror their ritual structure. It is obvious that these structures come from the domain of activities and not from language.

I have called these well-known structures of Vedic ritual ‘self-embedding’. That was in 1989, the year in which the same term was used to refer to the same structure by the American Sanskritist C.Z. Minkowski. Both worked independently and did not even know each other. Others have also independently found these structures and called them by diverse names: nesting, frame structures, ring composition and sleeping dogs which curl up. Similar expressions have been used with reference to mantras: rings within rings, omphalos structure, etc. In both domains, attention has been paid to the preponderance of a centre, even if it is empty.

Some philologists and even innocent readers may wonder: do such concepts occur in the texts? ‘Center,’ ‘nest’ and ‘sleeping dogs’ do, others do not, but asking that question is barking up the wrong tree. Oral compositions and texts both have to be understood. Understanding may emerge when we try to *analyse* what we study, which is what we have been trying to. It is not only necessary, but also the salt without which food has no taste.

The advantage of the term ‘self-embedding’ goes a step further. It embeds the work of Vedicists in the much more developed theories of contemporary linguistics which themselves occupy a tiny corner in the theory of recursive functions in logic, mathematics and computer science. Recursive procedures are ultimately inspired by the sequence of natural numbers 1, 2, 3,…. Indic recursivity is connected, therefore, with the fact that India, unlike ancient Greece, was not afraid of very large numbers or infinity.

Is there any need to return from syntax to semantics once again? The meaninglessness of ritual is rather obvious in the case of Vedic ritual because it is a domain of activity which has nothing to do with language. It can also be established with the help of Kautsa’s criteria. It is easy to see that six of the seven reasons that Kautsa gave or could have given for the meaninglessness of mantras \(*Eight: Atharvaveda*, Eleven: Mantras\) apply again. Vedic rituals have not changed much over time, their forms or structures have changed ever so slightly, their meaning is not taught. Shapes of wooden ladles that were used to pour oblations into the fire in Vedic times were taken over by Buddhists and Tantrics and can be found even now in the Shingon fire rituals of Japan. I leave it to the reader to check on the other reasons. The only reason which does not apply is Kautsa’s criterion number 3. It does not show that ritual is meaningless, but throws much light on it as we have already seen. Rites do not contradict each other because, like mantras, they cannot be: they are activities not statements. This explains part of their soothing nature and popularity. Rituals do not create conflict. They are mutually compatible and ritualists are naturally tolerant. The Śrauta Sūtra of Baudhāyana regularly uses expressions of the form: ‘Baudhāyana says that one should prefer ‘P’; Śāliki says that one should not; Aupamanyava says ….’ These are the *vikalpa* ‘alternatives’ we met with before.

The comparison between mantras and bird song is relatively new, but the insight that rituals are performed by non-human animals is as old as the Vedas. When Vedic stanzas declare that the layers of grass on which offerings are made constitute a nest, it is not a poetic simile but an obvious fact not requiring further comment. More relevant to the study of religion, though steadfastly ignored by many of its numerous experts who preserve a monotheistic outlook, is the fact that animal rituals have been studied for over half a century by ethnologists and almost equally long by historians of religion. I have the impression that we already know more about animal rituals than about Vedic ritual though it has been studied in India for thousands of years. Since there are many more animal species that engage in ritual than the few species of humans, we should expect much greater ritual variety among animals than in our own species.

Animal rituals go back at least as far as insects. There are large families of ritual structures that humans share with other animals. Most of them seem to be related to domestic rituals. Foremost among them are mating and territorial rites. The former ranges from courtship dances to marriage ceremonies; the latter from hopping around a favourite spot to military parades. Both are combined in preparing a nest or entering a new home. Whether animals have recursive Śrauta rituals I do not know, but a simple a priori argument suggests that they do not. There is only one uncontroversial fact that sets humans apart from the other animal species: language. Since the *theory* of ritual is expressed through language, the Śrauta rituals, in which theory and practice pervade each other, may be not only the most typical, but the only exclusively human ritual.



### How the Priests Work Together

Vedic ritual is a cooperative activity between priests on behalf of the patron or *yajamāna*, who is almost always accompanied by his wife. He will remunerate the priests at the end for their work by giving them a *dak*ṣ*i*ṇ*ā* or ritual gift. This is how Vedic rituals in general are often characterized, and illustrated by descriptions of the more spectacular occasions, such as the Royal Consecration or the famous *aśvamedha* or horse sacrifice. But when we witness the more commonly and frequently performed Śrauta rituals, and study their history, another and different picture emerges.

Since the Yajurvedins started re-organizing the ritual, they increasingly emphasized the role and the tasks of priests. They assigned four priests to each of the four Vedas. All sixteen, and in addition an optional Sadasya, who is in charge of the Sadas, are needed to officiate in the Soma and all larger Śrauta rituals that are based upon, or related to them.

There is a simple form of Vedic ritual in which only four priests take part. An offering of rice and barley cakes is made by the Adhvaryu of the Yajurveda with the assistance of three others: the Hotā of the Rigveda, the Agnīdh who is responsible for one exclamation and the Brahman who is silent and supervises the rites without participating. There are three episodes, each consisting of two elements and it is from such elementary episodes that larger units are constructed with the help of recursion:
>
> EPISODE I.

> Element 1. Adhvaryu commands Hotā to address the deity, e.g., Agni, by saying: ‘Address Agni\!’

> Element 2. Hotā addresses Agni by reciting mantras from the Rigveda.

> EPISODE II.

> Element 3. Adhvaryu exclaims to Agnīdh: ‘Make him hear\!’

> Element 4. Agnīdh shouts at the top of his voice: ‘So be it\! May he hear\!’

> EPISODE III.

> Element 5. Adhvaryu commands Hotā: ‘Say the offering verse for Agni\!’

> Element 6. Hotā begins by murmuring ‘Earth\! Air\! We who are saying the offering verse …’, raises his voice, recites the Rigvedic verse and ends with an exclamation: ‘May \(Agni\) lead \(the offerings to the gods\)\!’ At the last syllable, which Hotā shouts at the top of his voice: *vau ṢAṬ\!* \(*Twelve: Ritual*\), Adhvaryu makes the offering by throwing or pouring it into the fire. At the same time, the patron pronounces his ‘renunciation’ \(*tyāga*\): ‘This is for Agni, not for me\!’

A slightly more complex ritual may be constructed from this basic rite by adding another element that is substituted in the proper place—the first step of a process that, when extended further, may be described in recursive terms. In the animal sacrifice, an animal offering is substituted for the offering of rice or barley cakes and one more priest is needed: the Maitrāvaruṇa of the Rigveda. His insertion into the ritual proceedings is effected by extending Episode I with one element, as follows:
>
> Element 1. Adhvaryu commands Maitrāvaruṇa to command Hotā to address the deity.

> Element 1’. Maitrāvaruṇa commands Hotā to address the deity.

The reader will have noted two things. In this simple ritual, the patron or *yajamāna* performs only one rite: he renounces his ownership of the rice and barley cakes which he is offering to Agni. In the larger rituals, his tasks are more complex, but they are still negligible in comparison with all the chanting, recitation and ritual activities in which the sixteen priests engage. It may be compared to the building of a house: it is done by the architect with the help of numerous specialists who build the foundation, lay bricks, build walls and a roof, install the pipes and other mechanisms and contraptions through which water, electricity, etc., flow. There must be an owner also, who may or may not plan to live in the house but who has paid for everything. Just as building the house is done by the architect with his specialist assistants, performing the ritual is done by the priests.

Performing a ritual may be compared to making music. The conductor leads, the orchestra plays, and someone pays or makes money or is especially honoured on the occasion of the performance. Śrauta rituals are similar, the art of ritual is perfected by the performing priests, and the patron plays an essential but subordinate role. That tendency must have been present from the beginning and reaches its logical conclusion at the end of the Vedic period when so-called *sattra* rituals were performed by only priests, or priests who were all *yajamānas*, which comes to the same thing. In post-Vedic times, that pattern prevailed and in the end, the patron performs his tasks as if he were one of the priests. That is why Patañjali, when he compared the infinity of language to that of ritual, mentioned that it pertains to expressions that are never used ‘just like protracted *sattras*’.

The second thing that the reader will have noted is that I used the term ‘sacrifice’ to refer to the animal sacrifice. I could have used that loaded term once before when I referred to the atypical so-called ‘Hymn of Puruṣa’ where a primordial male is dismembered and killed \(*Three: Civilization and Society* 59, Three: Civilization and Society\). I did not because the term ‘sacrifice,’ which many scholars use to refer to what I call ‘ritual,’ comes with the ballast of a millennial tradition which is not Indic: the monotheistic tradition which started with Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice his son to his god, went on from there to the idea that god sent his son as a sacrifice to liberate humanity, and has presently reached the stage where the ultimate form of sacrifice is mass-suicide. Those ideas are not found in Vedic ritual and I believe that the term ‘sacrifice’ should be used in our context only in the very prescribed sense in which I have used it here, namely, to refer to a ritual in which an animal is killed.



### Human Sacrifice

Most Śrauta rituals require the sacrifice of goats. In the Puruṣa poem, the animal is human and it raises the question: did human sacrifice exist in India? We might start with the noun *medha* which refers in the Rigveda to the juice of meat or the marrow and later to any animal sacrifice. The term *puru*ṣ*amedha*, coined like *aśvamedha* or horse sacrifice, is mentioned in the Yajur- and Atharva Brāhmaṇas. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa is quite explicit on it and how could it not? There is nothing with which the Brāhmaṇas do *not* deal, as we have seen. In 1882, the learned translator of these texts, Julius Eggeling, had some worthwhile things to say on them.

The first is that the *puru*ṣ*amedha* is always treated as a symbolic, not an actual performance. That is not due to the fact that Professor Eggeling would be scandalized by this because he isn’t, not even by their ‘flimsy symbolism’ which he compared to the ‘speculative vapourings of the Gnostics’. He takes up the *puru*ṣ*amedha* first in a footnote where he crosses daggers with his old teacher, the famous Albrecht Weber, one of the great Vedic scholars of the nineteenth century, brother of the still more famous sociologist Max Weber. Albrecht had written that the would-be victims ‘may possibly at one time have been intended to be all of them slaughtered.’ Julius retorts, as a good pupil should his teacher, that that supposition ‘can hardly have been meant seriously. One might as well suppose that, at the *aśvamedha*, all the “evil-doers” who, according to Kātyāyana, are to bathe in the river, “were meant to be drowned”.’

According to Eggeling, the ‘human sacrifice’ was a theoretical scheme intended to complete the system.

Another argument, perhaps more straightforward is: if the ritual system included human sacrifice, it would lead to cannibalism, since the patron and his priests eat the omentum of the animal that is slaughtered, whether it is a goat \(the common option\) or a horse. No patron would want to be responsible for cannibalism and no participant would consent to engage in it either.

The two Eggeling arguments I have just sketched have an ethical ring about them. Perhaps the Vedas had no ethics. This is more or less Obeyesekhere’s thesis \(*Ten: Upaniṣads*\). Eggeling’s third argument has no such ring and is based upon straightforward philology and textual analysis. The only two Sūtras that describe the *puru*ṣ*amedha*, of the Śāṇkhāyana and Vaitāna schools, are in all details copies or adaptations of descriptions of the *aśvamedha* which had no existence in and by itself. I believe that is the best of Eggeling’s arguments but one must know something about the *aśvamedha* which I have not so far mentioned.

Performances of the horse-sacrifice have been popular because it is a royal ritual, meant to expand the king’s territory. It is mentioned in inscriptions, mostly read by scholars, but was popular in the Mahābhārata. Its popularity survives in Varanasi, where the central and most famous ghāt is called *daśāśvamedha*, not because there was a ‘Ten Horse Sacrifice’ \(as Diana Eck writes\), but because there were supposed to have been ten performances of the *aśvamedha* that ended there.

A special reason for the popularity of the *aśvamedha* is that it is not a ritual only for a king. It is a king whose queen has to lie next to the horse, covered by some kind of garment, a symbolic act since the horse is dead.

A final word about the terms ‘ritual’ and ‘sacrifice’. I have proposed to distinguish them from each other by using ‘ritual’ for the general category and reserving ‘sacrifice’ for a ritual in which an animal is ritually killed. I am not the first who made a distinction between the two terms. Albrecht Weber, whom I just mentioned, took the general meaning of Hotā to be ‘sacrificer’, not just ‘priest’. The verbal root from which Hotā is derived means either ‘sacrifice’ or ‘invoke’. According to Renou, the name of the Hotā priest must be connected with sacrifice, not invocation. J.C. Heesterman, from whom I learned a great deal about Vedic ritual, used ‘ritual’ in earlier publications, notably in his ‘Essays on Indian Ritual, Kingship and Society’ that are widely known as *The Inner Conflict of Tradition*. Later he published *The Broken World of Sacrifice* with the subtitle ‘An Essay in Ancient Indian Ritual’. The Introduction of that book begins with the lapidary statement: ‘Sacrifice seems to be out of fashion. In anthropology, where once it was an important theme, it seems to have fallen in disuse, if not disrepute.’ Heesterman maintains the distinction and his book describes ritualism as the total subjection of sacrifice to the rule of ritual.

Despite a massive amount of solid data, ever increasing in number, and an ever-expanding discussion that has engaged many top-class minds, my present chapter remains open-ended. I have tried to give an idea of some of the conceptual problems that bedevil the understanding of mantras and ritual, but we have not reached the core, let alone the end. The powers of mantras and ritual seem to be beyond the grasp of the human and social sciences and have not been explained by contemporary scholars or scientists. The same holds for meditation which is closely related to recitation and chant; and for bird song as we have already seen.

I conclude that we may with equanimity and for the time being, pay no serious attention to the ponderous ruminations and platitudes of some of our contemporaries. I prefer Yājñavalkya’s explanation of mantras, which may also apply to rituals: their power comes from the sun. He may also have accepted the Chāndogya claim that the sun, in its circular movements, makes the sound OM. Though I live in the country, I have been unable to hear it, but since most of the energy available on our planet comes from the sun in any case, Yājñavalkya’s explanation, while insufficiently precise, lacking in intelligible detail and certainly incomplete, is basically correct.
