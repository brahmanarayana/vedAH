One difficulty for ritual theory that Hubert and Mauss did not confront is that rituals form a hierarchy and rites at the top of it may last a thousand years or more. To state such a fact, we need recursiveness for statements cannot be infinitely long. Recursiveness is needed to explain language as we have seen. But recursiveness occurs in ritual also and there is a link between grammar and ritual theory. The grammarian Patañjali, author of the *Great Commentary* on Pāṇini’s grammar, was the first to arrive at that important insight. He wrote that neither rites, nor forms of language can be enumerated because no such enumeration would reach the end. Ritual and language can only be described and explained by treatises that provide *rules*. Such rules are called *sūtra* and that is what the Śrauta Sūtras and Pāṇini’s grammar are therefore called.

We have studied *left-recursive* and *right-recursive* rules. Ritual exhibits another feature of recursiveness that ritual possesses and mantras in its wake, but that is rare in language: *self-embedding*. Fortunately for us, it may be constructed by combining simple *left-* and *right-recursive* sentences from English \(the latter exhibits the same syntactic forms as we looked at before\). The following examples are increasingly stilted, but have been constructed in accordance with the rules of English grammar:

1. left-recursiveness:  
   *The roof of the building* which may be represented as BA;  
   *The chimney of the roof of the building* or CBA;  
   *The colour of the chimney of the roof of the building* or DCBA.
2. right-recursiveness:  
   *The building’s roof* or AB;  
   *The building’s roof’s chimney* or ABC;  
   *The building’s roof’s chimney’s colour* or ABCD.
3. *self-embedding*:  
   *The roof the building has* or BAB;  
   *The chimney the roof the building has has* or CBABC which is, in fact, C\(BAB\)C;  
   *The colour the chimney the roof the building has has has* or DCBABCD which is, in fact, D\(C\(BAB\)C\)D.

All three examples are artificial but \(1\) and \(2\) are possible and may become more natural if we introduce variations \(as in: *the colour of the chimney that sits on the roof of the building\).* All but the first of \(3\) are simply unintelligible. We can have billions of have-nots, but English cannot combine two *haves* together.

In Vedic ritual, \(3\) is very common. Here is a simplified example of D\(C\(BAB\)C\)D:
>
> D: constructing the enclosure

> C: entering the enclosure

> B: preparing the fire

> A: making an offering

> B: covering the fire

> C: leaving the enclosure

> D: destroying the enclosure.

Note that the last sequence corresponds to the first, the pre-final to the second, etc. It is a very common practice when performing an activity. We enter the room, open the cupboard, take out the cigar box, unlock and open it, take out the diamonds, close and lock the box again, close the cupboard and leave the room. We have, in this structure, taken one step more: EDCBABCDE or E\(D\(C\(BAB\)C\)D\)E. It does not occur in language unless it depicts an ongoing activity and someone expresses it with the help of concatenation as I just did. Self-embedding exists in mantras because Vedic rites are performed with mantras which mirror their ritual structure. It is obvious that these structures come from the domain of activities and not from language.

I have called these well-known structures of Vedic ritual ‘self-embedding’. That was in 1989, the year in which the same term was used to refer to the same structure by the American Sanskritist C.Z. Minkowski. Both worked independently and did not even know each other. Others have also independently found these structures and called them by diverse names: nesting, frame structures, ring composition and sleeping dogs which curl up. Similar expressions have been used with reference to mantras: rings within rings, omphalos structure, etc. In both domains, attention has been paid to the preponderance of a centre, even if it is empty.

Some philologists and even innocent readers may wonder: do such concepts occur in the texts? ‘Center,’ ‘nest’ and ‘sleeping dogs’ do, others do not, but asking that question is barking up the wrong tree. Oral compositions and texts both have to be understood. Understanding may emerge when we try to *analyse* what we study, which is what we have been trying to. It is not only necessary, but also the salt without which food has no taste.

The advantage of the term ‘self-embedding’ goes a step further. It embeds the work of Vedicists in the much more developed theories of contemporary linguistics which themselves occupy a tiny corner in the theory of recursive functions in logic, mathematics and computer science. Recursive procedures are ultimately inspired by the sequence of natural numbers 1, 2, 3,…. Indic recursivity is connected, therefore, with the fact that India, unlike ancient Greece, was not afraid of very large numbers or infinity.

Is there any need to return from syntax to semantics once again? The meaninglessness of ritual is rather obvious in the case of Vedic ritual because it is a domain of activity which has nothing to do with language. It can also be established with the help of Kautsa’s criteria. It is easy to see that six of the seven reasons that Kautsa gave or could have given for the meaninglessness of mantras \(*Eight: Atharvaveda*, Eleven: Mantras\) apply again. Vedic rituals have not changed much over time, their forms or structures have changed ever so slightly, their meaning is not taught. Shapes of wooden ladles that were used to pour oblations into the fire in Vedic times were taken over by Buddhists and Tantrics and can be found even now in the Shingon fire rituals of Japan. I leave it to the reader to check on the other reasons. The only reason which does not apply is Kautsa’s criterion number 3. It does not show that ritual is meaningless, but throws much light on it as we have already seen. Rites do not contradict each other because, like mantras, they cannot be: they are activities not statements. This explains part of their soothing nature and popularity. Rituals do not create conflict. They are mutually compatible and ritualists are naturally tolerant. The Śrauta Sūtra of Baudhāyana regularly uses expressions of the form: ‘Baudhāyana says that one should prefer ‘P’; Śāliki says that one should not; Aupamanyava says ….’ These are the *vikalpa* ‘alternatives’ we met with before.

The comparison between mantras and bird song is relatively new, but the insight that rituals are performed by non-human animals is as old as the Vedas. When Vedic stanzas declare that the layers of grass on which offerings are made constitute a nest, it is not a poetic simile but an obvious fact not requiring further comment. More relevant to the study of religion, though steadfastly ignored by many of its numerous experts who preserve a monotheistic outlook, is the fact that animal rituals have been studied for over half a century by ethnologists and almost equally long by historians of religion. I have the impression that we already know more about animal rituals than about Vedic ritual though it has been studied in India for thousands of years. Since there are many more animal species that engage in ritual than the few species of humans, we should expect much greater ritual variety among animals than in our own species.

Animal rituals go back at least as far as insects. There are large families of ritual structures that humans share with other animals. Most of them seem to be related to domestic rituals. Foremost among them are mating and territorial rites. The former ranges from courtship dances to marriage ceremonies; the latter from hopping around a favourite spot to military parades. Both are combined in preparing a nest or entering a new home. Whether animals have recursive Śrauta rituals I do not know, but a simple a priori argument suggests that they do not. There is only one uncontroversial fact that sets humans apart from the other animal species: language. Since the *theory* of ritual is expressed through language, the Śrauta rituals, in which theory and practice pervade each other, may be not only the most typical, but the only exclusively human ritual.
