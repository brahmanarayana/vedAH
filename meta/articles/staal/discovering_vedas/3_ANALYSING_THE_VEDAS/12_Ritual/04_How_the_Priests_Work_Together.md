title = "04 How the Priests Work Together"

+++

Vedic ritual is a cooperative activity between priests on behalf of the patron or *yajamāna*, who is almost always accompanied by his wife. He will remunerate the priests at the end for their work by giving them a *dakṣiṇā* or ritual gift. This is how Vedic rituals in general are often characterized, and illustrated by descriptions of the more spectacular occasions, such as the Royal Consecration or the famous *aśvamedha* or horse sacrifice. But when we witness the more commonly and frequently performed Śrauta rituals, and study their history, another and different picture emerges.

Since the Yajurvedins started re-organizing the ritual, they increasingly emphasized the role and the tasks of priests. They assigned four priests to each of the four Vedas. All sixteen, and in addition an optional Sadasya, who is in charge of the Sadas, are needed to officiate in the Soma and all larger Śrauta rituals that are based upon, or related to them.

There is a simple form of Vedic ritual in which only four priests take part. An offering of rice and barley cakes is made by the Adhvaryu of the Yajurveda with the assistance of three others: the Hotā of the Rigveda, the Agnīdh who is responsible for one exclamation and the Brahman who is silent and supervises the rites without participating. There are three episodes, each consisting of two elements and it is from such elementary episodes that larger units are constructed with the help of recursion:
>
> EPISODE I.

> Element 1. Adhvaryu commands Hotā to address the deity, e.g., Agni, by saying: ‘Address Agni\!’

> Element 2. Hotā addresses Agni by reciting mantras from the Rigveda.

> EPISODE II.

> Element 3. Adhvaryu exclaims to Agnīdh: ‘Make him hear\!’

> Element 4. Agnīdh shouts at the top of his voice: ‘So be it\! May he hear\!’

> EPISODE III.

> Element 5. Adhvaryu commands Hotā: ‘Say the offering verse for Agni\!’

> Element 6. Hotā begins by murmuring ‘Earth\! Air\! We who are saying the offering verse …’, raises his voice, recites the Rigvedic verse and ends with an exclamation: ‘May \(Agni\) lead \(the offerings to the gods\)\!’ At the last syllable, which Hotā shouts at the top of his voice: *vau ṢAṬ\!* \(*Twelve: Ritual*\), Adhvaryu makes the offering by throwing or pouring it into the fire. At the same time, the patron pronounces his ‘renunciation’ \(*tyāga*\): ‘This is for Agni, not for me\!’

A slightly more complex ritual may be constructed from this basic rite by adding another element that is substituted in the proper place—the first step of a process that, when extended further, may be described in recursive terms. In the animal sacrifice, an animal offering is substituted for the offering of rice or barley cakes and one more priest is needed: the Maitrāvaruṇa of the Rigveda. His insertion into the ritual proceedings is effected by extending Episode I with one element, as follows:
>
> Element 1. Adhvaryu commands Maitrāvaruṇa to command Hotā to address the deity.

> Element 1’. Maitrāvaruṇa commands Hotā to address the deity.

The reader will have noted two things. In this simple ritual, the patron or *yajamāna* performs only one rite: he renounces his ownership of the rice and barley cakes which he is offering to Agni. In the larger rituals, his tasks are more complex, but they are still negligible in comparison with all the chanting, recitation and ritual activities in which the sixteen priests engage. It may be compared to the building of a house: it is done by the architect with the help of numerous specialists who build the foundation, lay bricks, build walls and a roof, install the pipes and other mechanisms and contraptions through which water, electricity, etc., flow. There must be an owner also, who may or may not plan to live in the house but who has paid for everything. Just as building the house is done by the architect with his specialist assistants, performing the ritual is done by the priests.

Performing a ritual may be compared to making music. The conductor leads, the orchestra plays, and someone pays or makes money or is especially honoured on the occasion of the performance. Śrauta rituals are similar, the art of ritual is perfected by the performing priests, and the patron plays an essential but subordinate role. That tendency must have been present from the beginning and reaches its logical conclusion at the end of the Vedic period when so-called *sattra* rituals were performed by only priests, or priests who were all *yajamānas*, which comes to the same thing. In post-Vedic times, that pattern prevailed and in the end, the patron performs his tasks as if he were one of the priests. That is why Patañjali, when he compared the infinity of language to that of ritual, mentioned that it pertains to expressions that are never used ‘just like protracted *sattras*’.

The second thing that the reader will have noted is that I used the term ‘sacrifice’ to refer to the animal sacrifice. I could have used that loaded term once before when I referred to the atypical so-called ‘Hymn of Puruṣa’ where a primordial male is dismembered and killed \(*Three: Civilization and Society* 59, Three: Civilization and Society\). I did not because the term ‘sacrifice,’ which many scholars use to refer to what I call ‘ritual,’ comes with the ballast of a millennial tradition which is not Indic: the monotheistic tradition which started with Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice his son to his god, went on from there to the idea that god sent his son as a sacrifice to liberate humanity, and has presently reached the stage where the ultimate form of sacrifice is mass-suicide. Those ideas are not found in Vedic ritual and I believe that the term ‘sacrifice’ should be used in our context only in the very prescribed sense in which I have used it here, namely, to refer to a ritual in which an animal is killed.
