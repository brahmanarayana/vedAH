      <description>All the larger Soma rituals are characterized by sequences of rites which I have called ‘Soma Sequences’. Each consist of a Sāmaveda chant (stuti), a Rigveda recitation (śastra), Soma offerings and Soma drinking by the ritual patron and some of his priests. The Soma offerings are made out in the open, on the offering altar at the eastern end of the ritual arena. The other three rites take place behind the walls of the Sadas.</description>

      <description>Part I emphasized links of Vedic civilization with Central Asia and the Near East. Part II showed how that civilization moved south-east, adapted itself on the subcontinent to a new environment, interacted with other cultures and began to settle down. Ritual, history and geography illustrate how those settlements moved further east. Figure 16 shows how the Ritual Arena for the Soma ceremonies corresponds to the historical map of Central Asia including Vedic India.</description>

      <description>One might simplify Vedic ritual by describing it as a cooperative effort of priests from three Vedas: the Rigvedins recite, the Sāmavedins chant and the Yajurvedins perform rites. Some Rigvedins may be descendants through the male line of composers of the Rigveda. The Sāmavedins took their verse and set them to music, following melodies their ancestors had sung on the words of another language. There were rivalries between the two groups and our ritual sources show that the Sāmavedins were often discriminated against.</description>

      <description>Baudhāyana described the ancient paradigm: ‘Facing east (prāṇmukham), turning to the right (pradakṣiṇam), invested with the sacred thread, he performs the divine rites.’ In the course of the development of the Śrauta ritual, between say 1100 and 900 BCE, a paradigm change took place. ‘Facing east’ was replaced by ‘facing all directions’ (sarvatomukham). It is explicitly specified for the Agnicayana altar where, on each layer, the bricks are arranged and consecrated in specific directions.</description>

      <description>Towards the end of the Vedic period, rivals appeared on the horizon: Buddhism was one to which we return in Part V; literacy another. In the long run, Buddhism did not stay in India. Books bound in India continue to fall apart but the Vedic Oral Tradition is still there.
As for the Sadas, it would have been easy for Rig- and Sāmavedins to face each other. One solution would be to face all directions.</description>
