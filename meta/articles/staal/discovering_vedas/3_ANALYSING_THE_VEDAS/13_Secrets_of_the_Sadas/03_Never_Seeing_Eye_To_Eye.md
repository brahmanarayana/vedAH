title = "03 Never Seeing Eye To Eye"

One might simplify Vedic ritual by describing it as a cooperative effort of priests from three Vedas: the Rigvedins recite, the Sāmavedins chant and the Yajurvedins perform rites. Some Rigvedins may be descendants through the male line of composers of the Rigveda. The Sāmavedins took their verse and set them to music, following melodies their ancestors had sung on the words of another language. There were rivalries between the two groups and our ritual sources show that the Sāmavedins were often discriminated against.

The Yajurvedins were in charge of everything concerned with ritual, including the Sadas. We have seen how Sāyaṇa described it in Chapter 7: it displays the beauties of Rigveda and Sāmaveda on its walls like exquisite murals. The Yajurvedins made use of the rivalries between the two earlier Vedas and sought control over the two older priestly groups. They made those who recite Rigveda sit in a row on the eastern side, facing the auspicious east. They put those who chant Sāmaveda on the western side, facing all directions but the east, singing towards the north, west and south. The most important Sāmaveda priest is the Udgātā. His name means: ‘singing to the north’. Rig- and Sāmavedins could have sat quite differently—we shall return to that possibility—but the Yajurvedins made them sit with their backs to each other, literally never seeing eye to eye.

‘Never seeing eye to eye’ is an accurate description as we can see on Figure 17 where arrows depict the opposite directions the officiants face in the Sadas when they go through their sequences.

In Figure 18, we are looking east into the Sadas. In front, the three Sāmavedins are singing in their three directions. They mark the progressions of their chant on a piece of cloth with sticks. The bald Udgātā sits on the right with folded hands, singing to the north. Those who recite the Rigveda face east and the viewer therefore sees their backs. They are not reciting now, they are waiting for stage directions from the Sāmavedins. There are many rounds and calculating from the sticks, I would say it will take at least another thirty minutes.

What is kept hidden here behind walls? I believe it is the manipulations of the Yajurvedins, who were newcomers and upstarts. The other two may have been rivals, but they had already cooperated with each other. Without them, there would be nothing. Then the Yajurvedins took charge, introduced structure and established their power, following the principle of divide and rule. It fixed and empowered the Oral Tradition with the Yajurveda in control.
