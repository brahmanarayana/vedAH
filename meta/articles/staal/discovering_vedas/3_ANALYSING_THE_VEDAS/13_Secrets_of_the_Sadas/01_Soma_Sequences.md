+++

All the larger Soma rituals are characterized by sequences of rites which I have called ‘Soma Sequences’. Each consist of a Sāmaveda chant \(*stuti*\), a Rigveda recitation \(*śastra*\), Soma offerings and Soma drinking by the ritual patron and some of his priests. The Soma offerings are made out in the open, on the offering altar at the eastern end of the ritual arena. The other three rites take place behind the walls of the Sadas. Its position is shown in Figure 16. But it is only now that we will get an inkling of the significance of the Adhvaryu’s statement, which is issued at the beginning of each sequence: ‘You are the bed for coupling Rik and Sāman for the sake of procreation\!’ Procreation of what?

Each of the four parts of a Soma sequence consists of several elements.

A. The first part consists of four elements: 1\) the Adhvaryu’s statement above; 2\) a joint recitation by two Yajurveda priests that ends with ‘OM\! Chant\!’; 3\) the *stuti* itself; 4\) a joint recitation by Adhvaryu and patron called ‘Chant Milking.’

B. The second part consists again of four elements but the first consists of two sub-elements that flow into each other: 1A\) the *puroruc* or ‘prior light’ on which we almost slipped and 1B\) which is the *śastra*; 2\) a piece by the Rigveda reciter called ‘Recital Strength’. 3\) ‘Recitation Milking’ which corresponds to ‘Chant Milking’ followed by a special piece by the ritual patron:
>
> The ritual has been, has been produced,

> It is born, it has grown,

> It has become king of the gods.

> May it turn us into kings,

> May we be masters of wealth\!

C. The third part is the Soma offering. It has the recursive ritual structure studied in Chapter 12 and ends with the exclamation *vauṣa*ṭ, ‘may \(Agni\) lead \(the offerings to the gods\)\!’.

D. The fourth and final part is the culmination of the Soma sequence. It consists again of four elements: 1. Each priest who is about to drink addresses the Adhvaryu: ‘Adhvaryu, invite me.’ 2. The Adhvaryu replies: ‘You are invited’\! 3. Then comes Soma drinking. It is called Soma ‘partaking’, that is, ‘drinking’ or ‘eating’ \(*bhakṣaṇa*\), and consists of sipping accompanied by Rigveda recitals. 4. The Adhvaryu recites a long piece from the Rigveda called ‘Long Drink’.

The structure of this ritual construction may be expressed by an inverted tree:

We have here a careful construction in which everyone protects himself from all sides, that is: from other parties and possible rivals. This holds especially for the Yajurveda Adhvaryu and his colleagues. They see to it that they are involved everywhere and in control, if possible. The patron is also involved to the maximal extent and repeatedly joined by the Adhvaryu. All in all, it is a powerful demonstration of the strength of ritual along Yajurveda lines.

Offerings are given to the gods in the open. They involve again a good amount of Rigveda recitation and Sāmaveda chant. But the full weight of ritualism resides in the Sadas; and it provides an answer to the question: Procreation of what?

The Sadas is the locus of SV *stutis* and RV *śastras* for the sake of procreation and preservation of the oral tradition under supervision of the Yajurveda.

Sitting inside, the Sadas provides a link between ritual and the Upaniṣads and points, therefore, to the future. The early Upaniṣads continued to elucidate and interpret ritual. The Bṛhad-Āraṇyaka is an Āraṇyaka, as its name says, a continuation of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. The chief message of the Upaniṣads became to reject ritual and replace it by knowledge, but the connection between Sadas and Upaniṣad is obvious to all speakers of Sanskrit since the verbal root *sad-* of Upaniṣad is the same as the *sad-* of the *sadas*. It refers to a place to sit. Sitting was obviously important and that is not because chairs had not yet been invented. Sitting on the ground connects with the earth. So does sleeping on the ground which is sleeping with mother earth. The king does more than sleeping with her: he is her husband. The sitting Buddha makes a vow by touching the earth in a similar spirit and with a well-known gesture. Later meditators continue to sit. Zen made a cult of it. It is connected with breathing and may have something to do with erect spines. It also points to a *sedentary* civilization for *sed* equals *sad* which equals *sit*.
