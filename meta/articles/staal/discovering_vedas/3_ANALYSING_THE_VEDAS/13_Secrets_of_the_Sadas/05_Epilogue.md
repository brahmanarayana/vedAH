Towards the end of the Vedic period, rivals appeared on the horizon: Buddhism was one to which we return in Part V; literacy another. In the long run, Buddhism did not stay in India. Books bound in India continue to fall apart but the Vedic Oral Tradition is still there.

As for the Sadas, it would have been easy for Rig- and Sāmavedins to face each other. One solution would be to face all directions. Another, for each party to continue facing its preferential directions but face each other by sitting in a circle. It is a common practice in the round-table conferences of contemporary politics and looks like the most transparent solution, but it has another drawback: it is a display of insularity because the participants hide behind their backs something even more important—the wide open universe. Thus they resemble two-dimensional beings crawling within a circle.

Proceeding to the third dimension, imagine we were inhabiting the inside surface of our globe. On that interface we would be equally close to, or distant from each other as on the outside of the surface, the soles of our feet almost the same size. Inside there would be a small sun with the Himalayas tapering to insignificance. After some time, no one would notice the difference.
