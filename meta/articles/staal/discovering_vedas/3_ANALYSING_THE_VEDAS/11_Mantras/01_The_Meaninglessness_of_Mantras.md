title = "01 The Meaninglessness of Mantras"

+++

Mantras are not mysterious statements with deep meanings. They have no meaning because they are not statements and they are not statements because they are not language. Language is a human faculty which is concerned with *meaning* in its primary sense. In natural language, the domain of meaning is part of an intricate system. We shall take a closer look at this system in the next section, but it may be illustrated first by three expressions of language, each belonging to a different category:

1. *banana* which is a word, a noun in fact, that has a meaning to which I shall refer as ‘banana’.
2. *eating bananas* which is a phrase also has a meaning.
3. *Hiroshi likes bananas* which is a sentence also has a meaning.

What is systematic about these expressions is that indefinitely many, but not *any* other expressions may be substituted for any of their constituent words which would again lead to a similar category, that is a word, phrase or sentence:

In \(1\), any other word of the dictionary may be substituted for *banana* and the result will still be a word, by definition.

In \(2\), any noun that refers to an edible thing may be substituted for *banana*, but not *rivers* or *hesitations*; and similarly, a large number of verbal phrases may be substituted for *eating*, e.g., *liking, anticipating, throwing* but not *formulating* or *proposing.*

In \(3\), *Hiroshi* may be replaced by almost any name or expressions such as *the national hero of Finland*. But if we replace it by *King Janaka* we must replace *likes* by *liked*. Otherwise, the same conditions as were applicable to *eating bananas* in \(2\) apply to *likes bananas*. Note that all true or false sentences must be meaningful, but a meaningful sentence such as \(3\) need not be true, e.g., *Adolf Hitler loved Jews.*

The meaning of ‘last Sunday’s sunset’ is unlike the meanings of examples \(1\) to \(3\). It is not shared by the members of a community who share a language. It is much more restricted. It may have a meaning for *me* but only when it refers to a particular Sunday that I experienced. Perhaps I share some of it with others who witnessed the same sunset. But it is not part of their language. If you look up the dictionary under ‘Sunday’ you will not find my meaning there.

The same holds for the expression: ‘meaning of a mantra’. A mantra may have power or may perform a particular function. It has to be pronounced on a particular occasion. It may consist of the words of a language—Vedic Sanskrit, for example—but the meaning of the mantra is not the meaning of those words and *none* of the systematization of the expressions \(1\) through \(3\) applies to mantras unless it is by chance. There are a few exceptions to this general statement, e.g., mantras that belong to a special class such as *agnaye ida*ṃ *na mama*, *prajāpataye ida*ṃ *na mama*—of Chapter 7—not to mention the simple reason that the meaning of all the words that make up the mantra, or that of the entire sentence, if it is a sentence, need not be known to the users of the mantra.

Some of what applies to mantras applies to ritual. We shall return to ritual in the next chapter, but it is obvious that it is even further removed from language than mantras are. Ritual is a physical activity of the body but not only of the mouth and ears. It may accompany mantras as well as language but it is different from both.

If it is true that mantras and ritual have no meaning in the only intelligible sense, and are not language, are they not powerful and important? They are indeed as powerful and important as many other entities, say elephants or mice. Outside mythology, no one would even think of trying to explain an elephant by language. Perhaps an elephant, or elephants, or something about them may be explained with the help of biology, the theory of biological evolution, genetics, DNA or something else. Explanations of mantras and ritual that start from language, are similarly barking up the wrong tree. We must begin to accept, or regain the feeling that some readers who picked up this book may have had at the outset, that there is something to discover because we do not yet understand. It has nothing to do with familiarity. I am familiar with cars but I do not know how they are put together and have only the vaguest of notions about their origins in the history of human technology. Familiarity breeds not only contempt but a vague reaction like: yes, it is a mantra. If we wish to understand properly we must start with a sense of puzzlement, a sense of mystery even. Such a person feels lost. The reader who understands mantras and ritual already must stop here and go to Part IV.

Those of us who are puzzled and mystified may be pleased that the same embarrassment existed in Vedic India. As we have seen from Kautsa’s thesis \(*Eight: Atharvaveda*\), the Vedic tradition began to be questioned by its own followers. Kautsa focused on one particular feature: if mantras are regarded as language, they are meaningless. Part of the reason, and only a small part, lies in a particular historical development. The early portions of the Rigveda were jealously guarded by families who spoke a language, accompanied their rites and invoked their divinities in a language that was not at first understood by others who heard it spoken or used. It did not prevent these others from regarding Vedic mantras as powerful. Some were familiar with Sāmavedic chants that were similarly meaningless.

It is useful to remember that the historical development I sketched contributed to the unintelligibility of mantras, but more important to understand is that this is only a small part of the reason. Meaninglessness belongs to the nature of mantras. It is a feature of mantras as such. Kautsa’s arguments showed this clearly and the core of the argument is that mantras are not language. They lack the systematic nature that was illustrated by examples \(1\) to \(3\) above, but we need to know more about the system itself. Kautsa did because he was a linguist and I assume that most of my readers are not. More is now known about language than Kautsa knew and there are stronger and more decisive reasons that support his thesis.
