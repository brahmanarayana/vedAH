      <description>Mantras are not mysterious statements with deep meanings. They have no meaning because they are not statements and they are not statements because they are not language. Language is a human faculty which is concerned with meaning in its primary sense. In natural language, the domain of meaning is part of an intricate system. We shall take a closer look at this system in the next section, but it may be illustrated first by three expressions of language, each belonging to a different category:</description>

      <description>When I use the term ‘language’, what I have in mind is languages such as English or Sanskrit, modern or classical, world languages or tribal languages. Languages change and evolve over time. They are born and they die. They belong to or originate in a specific community though they may be adopted by others and become widespread. But language is a system in which everything hangs together, où tout se tient as de Saussure put it.</description>

      <title>03 Steps Beyond Kautsa</title>

      <description>Kautsa gave four reasons for the meaninglessness of mantras. (1) The sound of mantras may not be changed unlike in language where sounds may change provided meaning remains the same. (2) The order of elements in mantras may not be changed, unlike in Sanskrit where word order is to a large extent free. (3) If mantras were meaningful, it would have to be conceded that they are often contradictory or inconsistent with each other.</description>

      <description>If mantras are not language, for the analysis of which specialized disciplines such as linguistics, philology or literary criticism have been developed, where do we find more adequate concepts and categories to study them successfully? Can we learn something from logic or philosophy?
A popular approach to the study of mantras has been pragmatics. I am not referring to the pragmatism of William James, John Dewey or other philosophers, but to a discipline that is closely related to logic and that deals with so-called indexicals.</description>

      <title>05 The Gāyatrī Mantra</title>

      <description>The Gāyatrī mantra is called after its metre (Five: Rigveda): it consists of three verses of eight syllables which are long ‘—’ or short ‘^’ as in the following scheme:
How close mantras are to ritual is shown by the teaching of the Gāyatrī mantra which takes place during the initiation ritual of upanayana. Similar in formation to upaniṣad (‘sitting near’), upanayana means ‘taking near’. ‘Near’ may again be to the teacher, here called ācārya, or to the stage of studenthood after which the student is called a brahmacārin.</description>
