title = "05 The Gāyatrī Mantra"

+++

The Gāyatrī mantra is called after its metre \(*Five: Rigveda*\): it consists of three verses of eight syllables which are long ‘—’ or short ‘^’ as in the following scheme:

How close mantras are to ritual is shown by the teaching of the Gāyatrī mantra which takes place during the initiation ritual of *upanayana*. Similar in formation to *upaniṣad* \(‘sitting near’\), *upanayana* means ‘taking near’. ‘Near’ may again be to the teacher, here called *ācārya*, or to the stage of studenthood after which the student is called a *brahmacārin*. There are many ceremonies after which the teacher takes the boy’s hand and makes him look at the sun. After numerous other exchanges, variously described in various manuals, student and teacher sit north of a fire, the student facing east, that is, looking at the teacher, and the teacher facing west. The teacher then makes him repeat the first verse:
>
> *tat savitur vareṇyaṃ*.

He then makes him similarly repeat the second:
>
> *bhargo devasya dhīmahi*

and the third:
>
> *dhiyo yo na* *pracodayāt.*

Finally he makes him repeat all three:
>
> *tat savitur vareṇyaṃ*

> *bhargo devasya dhīmahi dhiyo yo naḥ pracodayāt.*

The boy is then given a staff, a grass girdle and several instructions, e.g., he should remain standing during the rest of the day. During the years of study that follow, he will be taught to learn by heart the Vedic school to which he belongs. He should not sleep by day and put a fire-stick on the fire in the morning and the evening. He should continue to recite the mantra every day at sunrise and sunset, at least ten and not more than a thousand times, depending again on his Vedic school.

Though the mantra has come to stand for the essence of the Veda, its recital at sunrise and sunset connects it with the sun. Savitā is the sun or rather, to distinguish him from Sūrya, the driving force behind the sun. The *brahmacārin* may sense that much though there is no rule that he should be told. The teacher may happen to be a scholar, traditional or modern, by inclination, but it is not part of his ritual task. He does not interpret or explain. The teaching is *orthoprax*, not *orthodox*. Kautsa had already drawn attention to the fact that there is a tradition for mantras to be learnt by heart, but no corresponding tradition to teach and thereby preserve their meaning.

It is difficult to say why the Gāyatrī mantra became so famous. It comes from an early poem of the Rigveda that invokes various deities. P.V. Kane refers to its ‘grand simplicity’ but that might be apparent to a learned scholar only. To a modern reader, the entire effort may make little sense apart from being a training of memory and an exercise in discipline. A modern or postmodern scholar may add that a sense of ‘identity’ is installed here. Yes, the *brahmacārin* is initiated into his Vedic school. It is his ‘second birth’ after he was born already in the general and non-Vedic sense, becoming a human and not a fish. I wonder whether humans in traditional societies think about ‘identity’. A modern and trendy concept. The Gāyatrī mantra as I have described is conveyed to a student at the time of his *upanayana* or initiation into the Brahman community. With the hardening of the caste system in post-Vedic times, ritual discussions proliferated about the question whether the three classes of ‘twice-born’ castes, *brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas* and *vaiśyas* should all be initiated with the same mantra or with different mantras. If the latter, mantras are differentiated from each other by their metres: *tri*ṣṭ*ubh* \(four verses of eleven syllables\) and *jagat*ī \(four verses of twelve syllables\). The system remained the same and preserved the same formal character.

Kautsa’s observation that there is a tradition for mantras to be learnt by heart, but no corresponding tradition to teach and thereby preserve their meaning, is full of significance and deep implications. To understand it better we must take a closer look at that tradition.

Transmitting the Gāyatrī mantra requires an elaborate ritual setting. For the student, it is an act of intense concentration, whether or not he is puzzled by its significance. It is very different from picking up a language, almost unconsciously, by hearing what other people, including fathers, mothers, other family members, teachers, playmates, visitors, salesmen or anyone within hearing of the student say and do when they use their language. This picking up of language occurs within a few years and is based upon knowledge and capacities drawn from an innate component or components of the mind.

Some of these features apply, or apply in a more or less similar fashion, to mantras. Youngsters who sit around when teachers are reciting or priests perform rituals pick up something. But they have to be explicitly taught a great deal more, unlike the babies or small children who acquire mastery over the partly innate faculty of language that humans possess. Unless it is a particular song—like a password—a youngster is never taught a sequence of words like the *brahmacārin* who learns to recite: *tat savitur vareṇya*ṃ *bhargo devasya dhīmahi dhiyo yo na*ḥ *pracodayāt*. He has to repeat that sequence at sunrise and sunset, and on other specified occasions, throughout most of his life. No sentence of a maternal language needs to be repeated like that.

Picking up language includes another feature that is different from recitation: infinitely many other forms are picked up as well. After picking up: ‘Give me a piece of bread,’ the child may substitute another word in order to obtain another effect: ‘Give me a cookie.’ Note that the child may never have heard that same sentence before. I am not a child psychologist, so must confine myself to simplistic constructions, but there are others known from history which are not simple and make the same point. The British historian T.B. Macaulay was regarded as a retarded child until he opened his mouth for the first time when he was almost ten years old. During a party, a lady slipped and poured a pot of tea over the poor dumb child who then opened his mouth and said: ‘Don’t worry Madam, the pain has much abated.’ Can we do anything like that with the Gāyatrī mantra? Can we substitute a single word, keeping the same structure, for example, and produce another mantra:
>
> \* *tat śivasya vareṇya*ṃ *bhargo devasya dhīmahi dhiyo yo na*ḥ * pracodayāt*

or more daringly:
>
> *\* tat savitur vareṇya*ṃ *bhargo śivasya dhīmahi dhiyo yo na*ḥ *pracodayāt*

or worst of all but still keeping the structure:
>
> *\* tat savitur vareṇya*ṃ *bhargo devasya śivasya dhiyo yo na*ḥ *pracodayāt*?

> \(asterisks indicate here that the following expression is not a mantra\).

Why did I say, in the last case, ‘worst of all’? Because I know the language and therefore the syntax which the reciter or the reader need not. Even so, the reader will have noticed that I substituted the name of a god \(Śiva\) with an ending \(*śivasya*\) in the first two cases for forms of the names of another god \(*savitur*\) or for the word god itself \(*devasya*\). In the third case, I replaced a different kind of word, in fact, a verbal form \(*dhīmahi*\) by *śivasya*. None of these things can be done with mantras though they all illustrate what a child learns when it learns a language; but the last case illustrates a thing children who learn a language never do. They may say *mans* when they should say *men*, but they would not continue to say *cookie* when they mean *go out*.

We cannot take a mantra and add it recursively to another, or another to it, or something else similar to the manner in which it is done in learning a natural language. There is only one recursive rule that can be used in the realm of mantras and that of *stobhas* in the Sāmaveda: repetition. But did we not see, in the Morning Litany, that mantras were recited in the same manner in which *Maya was eager to go to the dinner* was replaced by *Maya was eager to go to the concert* \(earlier in this chapter\)?

We did, but if we look more closely the two situations are totally different. The two sentences about Maya differ *syntactically* as well as semantically: the objects of Maya’s eagerness are syntactic objects, *dinner* and *concert*, and they occur in a specific place in the structure of the sentence. The common part of the two mantras, *mahe no adya*, has no syntactic status at all. They are merely the first three words of a series of words. They have no internal structure and can only be depicted by an expression of the unstructured form:

Mantras are memorized from left to right and if two mantras happen to begin with the same two sequences, like **A1 A2 A3**, mistakes like the ones that were made during the 2003 Soma ritual are likely to occur. It does not imply that mantras do not have a structure—we have seen that they do—but it is totally different from the syntactic stucture of a natural language and learning that structure is a totally different process also.

Not only their structure, also their function is entirely different. And last but not least, apparent words or what look like words in mantras cannot be replaced by others, one of the most striking characteristics of natural language which accounts for its extraordinary creativity and is largely responsible for distinguishing the human animal from other animal species.

It is a good thing that there is a tradition for mantras to be learnt by heart for otherwise there would be no Vedas. My conclusion, that the system of mantras is unlike the system of language, does not affect and has nothing to do with their value. But we should know what they are and what they are not, and what we have learnt in this chapter is that Vedic mantras, whether we are referring to obviously meaningless syllables such as the stobhas, or to mantras that consist of words, are learnt in a manner that is differerent from the manner in which a natural language is learnt.

All of this has nothing to do with the undoubted fact, that almost all mantras that consist of words were originally used in sentences and in a meaningful fashion in the Vedic contexts from where they were taken. They may be bits and pieces of these original sentences, or entire sentences like the Gāyatrī mantra. As we are coming to the end of the present chapter, the reader may be curious to know *what* the meaning of that mantra is, even if it is only distantly related to our topic. By ‘meaning’ I mean: the meaning of the language of the verse of the Rigveda from where it is taken which is RV 3.62.10. Its meaning is: ‘May we receive this excellent splendour of the god Savitā, which should inspire our thoughts\!’ It may be understood by the reciter, all or in part, depending on his knowledge of the language; perhaps he is a student of Sanskrit or on his way to becoming one. But understanding its language is nowhere required and has nothing to do with the ritual functions of that mantra. That is the full significance of Kautsa’s fifth thesis: ‘There is a tradition for mantras to be learnt by heart, but no corresponding tradition to teach and thereby preserve their meaning.’
