### Soma Sequences

All the larger Soma rituals are characterized by sequences of rites which I have called ‘Soma Sequences’. Each consist of a Sāmaveda chant \(*stuti*\), a Rigveda recitation \(*śastra*\), Soma offerings and Soma drinking by the ritual patron and some of his priests. The Soma offerings are made out in the open, on the offering altar at the eastern end of the ritual arena. The other three rites take place behind the walls of the Sadas. Its position is shown in Figure 16. But it is only now that we will get an inkling of the significance of the Adhvaryu’s statement, which is issued at the beginning of each sequence: ‘You are the bed for coupling Rik and Sāman for the sake of procreation\!’ Procreation of what?

Each of the four parts of a Soma sequence consists of several elements.

A. The first part consists of four elements: 1\) the Adhvaryu’s statement above; 2\) a joint recitation by two Yajurveda priests that ends with ‘OM\! Chant\!’; 3\) the *stuti* itself; 4\) a joint recitation by Adhvaryu and patron called ‘Chant Milking.’

B. The second part consists again of four elements but the first consists of two sub-elements that flow into each other: 1A\) the *puroruc* or ‘prior light’ on which we almost slipped and 1B\) which is the *śastra*; 2\) a piece by the Rigveda reciter called ‘Recital Strength’. 3\) ‘Recitation Milking’ which corresponds to ‘Chant Milking’ followed by a special piece by the ritual patron:
>
> The ritual has been, has been produced,

> It is born, it has grown,

> It has become king of the gods.

> May it turn us into kings,

> May we be masters of wealth\!

C. The third part is the Soma offering. It has the recursive ritual structure studied in Chapter 12 and ends with the exclamation *vau*ṣ*a*ṭ, ‘may \(Agni\) lead \(the offerings to the gods\)\!’.

D. The fourth and final part is the culmination of the Soma sequence. It consists again of four elements: 1. Each priest who is about to drink addresses the Adhvaryu: ‘Adhvaryu, invite me.’ 2. The Adhvaryu replies: ‘You are invited’\! 3. Then comes Soma drinking. It is called Soma ‘partaking’, that is, ‘drinking’ or ‘eating’ \(*bhak*ṣ*a*ṇ*a*\), and consists of sipping accompanied by Rigveda recitals. 4. The Adhvaryu recites a long piece from the Rigveda called ‘Long Drink’.

The structure of this ritual construction may be expressed by an inverted tree:

We have here a careful construction in which everyone protects himself from all sides, that is: from other parties and possible rivals. This holds especially for the Yajurveda Adhvaryu and his colleagues. They see to it that they are involved everywhere and in control, if possible. The patron is also involved to the maximal extent and repeatedly joined by the Adhvaryu. All in all, it is a powerful demonstration of the strength of ritual along Yajurveda lines.

Offerings are given to the gods in the open. They involve again a good amount of Rigveda recitation and Sāmaveda chant. But the full weight of ritualism resides in the Sadas; and it provides an answer to the question: Procreation of what?

The Sadas is the locus of SV *stutis* and RV *śastras* for the sake of procreation and preservation of the oral tradition under supervision of the Yajurveda.

Sitting inside, the Sadas provides a link between ritual and the Upaniṣads and points, therefore, to the future. The early Upaniṣads continued to elucidate and interpret ritual. The Bṛhad-Āraṇyaka is an Āraṇyaka, as its name says, a continuation of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. The chief message of the Upaniṣads became to reject ritual and replace it by knowledge, but the connection between Sadas and Upaniṣad is obvious to all speakers of Sanskrit since the verbal root *sad-* of Upaniṣad is the same as the *sad-* of the *sadas*. It refers to a place to sit. Sitting was obviously important and that is not because chairs had not yet been invented. Sitting on the ground connects with the earth. So does sleeping on the ground which is sleeping with mother earth. The king does more than sleeping with her: he is her husband. The sitting Buddha makes a vow by touching the earth in a similar spirit and with a well-known gesture. Later meditators continue to sit. Zen made a cult of it. It is connected with breathing and may have something to do with erect spines. It also points to a *sedentary* civilization for *sed* equals *sad* which equals *sit*.



### Moving South and East

Part I emphasized links of Vedic civilization with Central Asia and the Near East. Part II showed how that civilization moved south-east, adapted itself on the subcontinent to a new environment, interacted with other cultures and began to settle down. Ritual, history and geography illustrate how those settlements moved further east. Figure 16 shows how the Ritual Arena for the Soma ceremonies corresponds to the historical map of Central Asia including Vedic India. The officiating priests are not aware of those correspondences and they remain unexpressed by the large majority of our sources.

The three arrows on the historical map, two earlier and one slightly later, depict the movements of Indo-Aryan. They originate from the Central Asian homeland, around the BMAC \(3 and 6 on the Frontspiece\), where speakers of Indo-Aryan or Proto-Indo-Aryan made offerings on a flat piece of soil on which a fire had been installed. It survives in the Ancient Hut on the left or west of the Ritual Arena where the flat piece of soil has been replaced by small altars as in Figure 15. The fire embers were carried in a pot to wherever the family pitched its tent. It corresponds to the carrying of fire to the new home of the ritual patron as mentioned in Chapter 7. The western part of the Ancient Hut was reserved for the patron’s wife and the remaining space was used for domestic or quasi-domestic rites, and functioned as a kitchen for the preparation of food or offerings to the gods. Because of its domestic character, the Ancient Hut is surrounded by walls, like the Sadas but for different reasons: the protection and privacy of the wife.

To the east of the Ancient Hut a new enclosure is constructed. Its first structure is the Sadas which points to Pirak, where the earliest excavated Vedic altars come from. Their extraordinary shapes are similar to those of the altars in front of which the Rigvedins recite their *śastras* \(Figure 20\). To the east of the Sadas is the enclosure where the Soma is prepared and kept. It is connected with Mount Mūjavat in the Pamirs, near the source of the Oxus, where the best Soma came from. At the eastern end, the bird-shaped offering altar represents the Kuru area where, around 1,000 BCE, the Yajurveda and the other Vedas were composed and the ritual piling of the Agnicayana took place for the first time.

Moving east within the ritual enclosure does not *mean* moving east from the Indus to the Ganges Valleys, but the correspondence with the outside world need not surprise us: facing east, which is ritually auspicious, is also the direction of the rising sun, and the same holds for the clockwise circumambulations that are common in many rituals of the northern hemisphere.

The basic movements are defined by all the ritual sūtras and most authoritatively by the Śrauta Sūtra of Baudhāyana. It declares at the outset of the list of metarules with which it begins: ‘Facing east \(*prā*ṇ*mukham*\), turning to the right \(*pradak*ṣ*i*ṇ*am*\), invested with the sacred thread, he performs the divine rites.’ ‘He,’ the subject of *karoti karmā*ṇ*i* \(‘he performs the rites’\) is the default officiant: the Adhvaryu priest of the Yajurveda, the Veda to which Baudhāyana belongs. The Adhvaryu is the organizer and manager of the ritual, whose historical task was the incorporation of Rigvedic recitations and Sāmavedic chants, specifically the *śastras* and *stutis*. The notion of default occurs in the Śrauta Sūtras as we shall see in Chapter 14 \(*Fourteen: Sūtra: Vedic Sciences*\). But we have not explained why the Adhvaryu hid these important contributions behind walls.



### Never Seeing Eye To Eye

One might simplify Vedic ritual by describing it as a cooperative effort of priests from three Vedas: the Rigvedins recite, the Sāmavedins chant and the Yajurvedins perform rites. Some Rigvedins may be descendants through the male line of composers of the Rigveda. The Sāmavedins took their verse and set them to music, following melodies their ancestors had sung on the words of another language. There were rivalries between the two groups and our ritual sources show that the Sāmavedins were often discriminated against.

The Yajurvedins were in charge of everything concerned with ritual, including the Sadas. We have seen how Sāyaṇa described it in Chapter 7: it displays the beauties of Rigveda and Sāmaveda on its walls like exquisite murals. The Yajurvedins made use of the rivalries between the two earlier Vedas and sought control over the two older priestly groups. They made those who recite Rigveda sit in a row on the eastern side, facing the auspicious east. They put those who chant Sāmaveda on the western side, facing all directions but the east, singing towards the north, west and south. The most important Sāmaveda priest is the Udgātā. His name means: ‘singing to the north’. Rig- and Sāmavedins could have sat quite differently—we shall return to that possibility—but the Yajurvedins made them sit with their backs to each other, literally never seeing eye to eye.

‘Never seeing eye to eye’ is an accurate description as we can see on Figure 17 where arrows depict the opposite directions the officiants face in the Sadas when they go through their sequences.

In Figure 18, we are looking east into the Sadas. In front, the three Sāmavedins are singing in their three directions. They mark the progressions of their chant on a piece of cloth with sticks. The bald Udgātā sits on the right with folded hands, singing to the north. Those who recite the Rigveda face east and the viewer therefore sees their backs. They are not reciting now, they are waiting for stage directions from the Sāmavedins. There are many rounds and calculating from the sticks, I would say it will take at least another thirty minutes.

What is kept hidden here behind walls? I believe it is the manipulations of the Yajurvedins, who were newcomers and upstarts. The other two may have been rivals, but they had already cooperated with each other. Without them, there would be nothing. Then the Yajurvedins took charge, introduced structure and established their power, following the principle of divide and rule. It fixed and empowered the Oral Tradition with the Yajurveda in control.



### Facing All Directions

Baudhāyana described the ancient paradigm: ‘Facing east \(*prā*ṇ*mukham*\), turning to the right \(*pradak*ṣ*i*ṇ*am*\), invested with the sacred thread, he performs the divine rites.’ In the course of the development of the Śrauta ritual, between say 1100 and 900 BCE, a paradigm change took place. ‘Facing east’ was replaced by ‘facing all directions’ \(*sarvatomukham*\). It is explicitly specified for the *Agnicayana* altar where, on each layer, the bricks are arranged and consecrated in specific directions. What applies to the directions of bricks applies to the directions of the officiants themselves. Baudhāyana repeats it five times in his Śrauta Sūtra formulations, at the beginning of each of the five layers and with the help of two statements which I shall put between single quotes. They quote metarules \(*Fourteen: Sūtra: Vedic Sciences*\) \(between double quotes\) as is their wont. First he says: ‘Metarules like “he deposits them toward the east, he deposits them toward the west” denote the series of bricks when there are groups.’ Then he continues: ‘Metarules like “he deposits it toward the east, he deposits it toward the west” indicate that the agent who does the depositing faces in that direction.’ He mentions east and west explicitly but it is obvious throughout that it applies to all the four directions.

The new paradigm explains two things, one about the Yajurvedins, the other about the Sāmavedins. The Yajurvedins, who took over the organization of the ritual during Kuru times, had to accommodate two rival parties and thereby created the edifice first of three, then of four Vedas, sealed their canonization and tried to safeguard the supremacy of the Vedas and of themselves for all times.

The case of the Sāmavedins is special as we have seen. The words of the original, indigenous Sāmaveda chants are lost; but we know something about them because of some of their names and the names of some of the altars with which they were associated. They are non-Indo-European: some have a recognizably BMAC structure and a few are Dravidian. The words of the Rigveda often do not fit and the melodies seem to reflect another language.

What do we know about the development of ritual during those periods? We possess a fragmentary knowledge of Rigvedic rites and know nothing or next to nothing about the rites of the ancestors of the Sāmavedins. The development of Vedic Śrauta ritual started with their halting cooperation and was subsequently organized, systematized and brought to completion by the Yajurvedins during the Kuru period. Reciters and chanters were familiar with other ritualists and ritual constructions, representatives of more distant or eccentric groups \(some from the BMAC\), but it is cooperation with each other that they primarily sought. At the stage of development depicted in the original or proto-Sadas, that cooperative effort was in its infancy. Later it became more universal as signalled by the paradigm change to ‘all directions’.

During the mature Kuru period, Rig- and Sāmavedins had lived in the same surroundings and society for some time. First they were rivals who could not and did not want to understand or communicate with each other, let alone enquire or learn about each others myths and speculations or teach their own. It goes a long way to explain, that Vedic Śrauta ritual has nothing to do with Rigvedic mythology. It is a characteristic of all ritual, its mantra counterpart occurs in Kautsa and there are exceptions in more modern developments \(e.g., in contemporary performances in Kerala\) and in the Shingon ritual of Japan. Even so and on the whole, it is characteristic of Vedic ritual, and apparently of Indic rituals in general, that they continue to live a life of their own. They have to be performed in the correct manner as we have seen in Chapter 12 and that is all there is to it.

Such a situation is common in music, dance or science and shows where ritual belongs. Musicians are able to cooperate closely without being able to converse, understand or read the same language. It applies to singers, orchestras or chamber music—Caland likened the ritual ensemble of the four Vedas to a string quartet—especially when there are last minute substitutes, visiting performers or alien maestros. Scientists are also able to cooperate closely without knowing each other’s natural language. What they need to understand is artificial languages such as the language of algebra \(to which we return in a wider context in Chapter 15\). Rituals, mantras and equations are like dance of which Isadora Duncan said: ‘If I could tell you what it meant, there would be no point in dancing it.’



### Epilogue

Towards the end of the Vedic period, rivals appeared on the horizon: Buddhism was one to which we return in Part V; literacy another. In the long run, Buddhism did not stay in India. Books bound in India continue to fall apart but the Vedic Oral Tradition is still there.

As for the Sadas, it would have been easy for Rig- and Sāmavedins to face each other. One solution would be to face all directions. Another, for each party to continue facing its preferential directions but face each other by sitting in a circle. It is a common practice in the round-table conferences of contemporary politics and looks like the most transparent solution, but it has another drawback: it is a display of insularity because the participants hide behind their backs something even more important—the wide open universe. Thus they resemble two-dimensional beings crawling within a circle.

Proceeding to the third dimension, imagine we were inhabiting the inside surface of our globe. On that interface we would be equally close to, or distant from each other as on the outside of the surface, the soles of our feet almost the same size. Inside there would be a small sun with the Himalayas tapering to insignificance. After some time, no one would notice the difference.
