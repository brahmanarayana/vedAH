Gosava and Bovine Mimesis in Ritual-Part 2
June 28, 2016 in Conceptual Origins, Delving into the Text, Uncategorized Leave a comment Gosava and Bovine Mimesis in Ritual-Part2
Potentially disturbing content ahead. The following article discusses a rite the details of which are bound to disturb some Hindu readers. It is plainly not for everyone.
My heartfelt thanks and gratitude tośrīmānasa-taraṃgiṇī for helping me with the translation of JB 2.</description>

Gosava and Bovine Mimesis in Ritual-Part 1
March 24, 2016 in Conceptual Origins, Delving into the Text 3 Comments Gosava and Bovine Mimesis in Ritual-Part1
Disclaimer: The article discusses a rite commonly associated with sexual deviancies that may be very disturbing to those who are used to reading texts in a Victorian moral framework. Not your cup of tea if your mental images of the Dharma are mainly that of Rāma as a filial son, Kṛṣṇa stealing butter or Bāl Hanuman cartoons.</description>

At the 1975 Agnicayana-Athirathram in Panjal, Kerala — a group of scholars &amp;amp; filmmakers studied/recorded the event after the great Erkkara Raman Namboodiri agreed to it being recorded: here, Frits Staal, Romila Thapar, Kevin Burke, Robert Gardner, Asko Parpola, Kunju Vasudevan.
At the Agnicayana sacrifice in Panjal, Kerala, 1975; when there was protest against the potential use of animal sacrifice, the Namboodiris formed a consultative group, &amp;amp; decided to substitute animals with pistapashu [representative clay/rice] as done by the Mádhavas in Mysore.</description>

Śudrāchāra śiromaņi prescribes &amp;ldquo;tat saviturvareņyam&amp;rdquo; as sāvitrī for v1s, &amp;ldquo;deva savituh&amp;rdquo; for v2s and &amp;ldquo;viśvā rūpāņi&amp;rdquo; for v3s. I don&amp;rsquo;t know a mantra that starts with &amp;ldquo;deva savituh&amp;rdquo;. Also there are bunch of mantras that start with &amp;ldquo;viśvā rūpāņi&amp;rdquo;. Not sure which formulae implied here.
since deva savituH is ungrammatical, I believe it is the subsequently mantra to the classic sAvitrI: devasya savitur vayaM vAjayantaH purandhyA | - MT</description>

      <description>विस्तारः (द्रष्टुं नोद्यम्) altekar&amp;rsquo;s description of the wooden yūpa and how the stone yūpa-s differed from it.
Sacred texts declare that yupas should be made of wood. The Katyayana-Srautasutra vividly describes the expedition for securing a suitable stump for this purpose how the tree is to be felled, how its superfluous branches are to be chopped, etc. Different results are promised to the sacrificer according to the tree that may be selected for making the yupa.</description>
