For what it's worth, the ritual does not explicitly præscribe an actual act of incest, just approaching the women with sexual intent.  The phrasing is upá mātáram iyād upá svásāram upá ságotrām (JB 2.113, ĀpŞS 22.13.2, HŞS 17.5.25), with upá √i meaning "approach" often used in a sexual context.  The translation in the attached image (by an Indian) overstates the original language.

In any case I think this ritual should be a lesson to Vedists that far from expanding Vedism to include the Āraṇyaká-s and the Upaniṣád-s, even certain Brā́hmaṇa-s must sometimes be taken with great suspicion—not being Divinely inspired poëtry, but the words of people who composed and (sometimes centuries later) passed down Divine poëtry
